So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and he took two stone tablets in his hand. -- exodus 34:4
.
The LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the LORD. -- exodus 34:5
.
Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; -- exodus 34:6
.
who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations." -- exodus 34:7
.
Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship. -- exodus 34:8
.
He said, "If now I have found favor in Your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go along in our midst, even though the people are so obstinate, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your own possession." -- exodus 34:9
.
Then God said, "Behold, I am going to make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the LORD, for it is a fearful thing that I am going to perform with you. -- exodus 34:10
.
"Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. -- exodus 34:11
.
"Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a snare in your midst. -- exodus 34:12
.
"But rather, you are to tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim -- exodus 34:13
.
--for you shall not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God-- -- exodus 34:14
.
otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice, -- exodus 34:15
.
and you might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters might play the harlot with their gods and cause your sons also to play the harlot with their gods. -- exodus 34:16
.
"You shall make for yourself no molten gods. -- exodus 34:17
.
"You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt. -- exodus 34:18
.
"The first offspring from every womb belongs to Me, and all your male livestock, the first offspring from cattle and sheep. -- exodus 34:19
.
"You shall redeem with a lamb the first offspring from a donkey; and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. None shall appear before Me empty-handed. -- exodus 34:20
.
"You shall work six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during plowing time and harvest you shall rest. -- exodus 34:21
.
"You shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks, that is, the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year. -- exodus 34:22
.
"Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. -- exodus 34:23
.
"For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God. -- exodus 34:24
.
"You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor is the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover to be left over until morning. -- exodus 34:25
.
"You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. "You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk." -- exodus 34:26
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel." -- exodus 34:27
.
So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments. -- exodus 34:28
.
It came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses' hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him. -- exodus 34:29
.
So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him. -- exodus 34:30
.
Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them. -- exodus 34:31
.
Afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them to do everything that the LORD had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. -- exodus 34:32
.
When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. -- exodus 34:33
.
But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out; and whenever he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he had been commanded, -- exodus 34:34
.
the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone. So Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him. -- exodus 34:35
.
Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do: -- exodus 35:1
.
"For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy day, a sabbath of complete rest to the LORD; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death. -- exodus 35:2
.
"You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day." -- exodus 35:3
.
Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying, -- exodus 35:4
.
'Take from among you a contribution to the LORD; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as the LORD'S contribution: gold, silver, and bronze, -- exodus 35:5
.
and blue, purple and scarlet material, fine linen, goats' hair, -- exodus 35:6
.
and rams' skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood, -- exodus 35:7
.
and oil for lighting, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense, -- exodus 35:8
.
and onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastpiece. -- exodus 35:9
.
'Let every skillful man among you come, and make all that the LORD has commanded: -- exodus 35:10
.
the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; -- exodus 35:11
.
the ark and its poles, the mercy seat, and the curtain of the screen; -- exodus 35:12
.
the table and its poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; -- exodus 35:13
.
the lampstand also for the light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for the light; -- exodus 35:14
.
and the altar of incense and its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance of the tabernacle; -- exodus 35:15
.
the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand; -- exodus 35:16
.
the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; -- exodus 35:17
.
the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords; -- exodus 35:18
.
the woven garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.'" -- exodus 35:19
.
Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from Moses' presence. -- exodus 35:20
.
Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the LORD'S contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments. -- exodus 35:21
.
Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so did every man who presented an offering of gold to the LORD. -- exodus 35:22
.
Every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet material and fine linen and goats' hair and rams' skins dyed red and porpoise skins, brought them. -- exodus 35:23
.
Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and bronze brought the LORD'S contribution; and every man who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service brought it. -- exodus 35:24
.
All the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, in blue and purple and scarlet material and in fine linen. -- exodus 35:25
.
All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats' hair. -- exodus 35:26
.
The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece; -- exodus 35:27
.
and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. -- exodus 35:28
.
The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring material for all the work, which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill offering to the LORD. -- exodus 35:29
.
Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, "See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. -- exodus 35:30
.
"And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship; -- exodus 35:31
.
to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in bronze, -- exodus 35:32
.
and in the cutting of stones for settings and in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work. -- exodus 35:33
.
"He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. -- exodus 35:34
.
"He has filled them with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and in fine linen, and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs. -- exodus 35:35
.
"Now Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skillful person in whom the LORD has put skill and understanding to know how to perform all the work in the construction of the sanctuary, shall perform in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded." -- exodus 36:1
.
Then Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful person in whom the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to the work to perform it. -- exodus 36:2
.
They received from Moses all the contributions which the sons of Israel had brought to perform the work in the construction of the sanctuary. And they still continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning. -- exodus 36:3
.
And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work which he was performing, -- exodus 36:4
.
and they said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the LORD commanded us to perform." -- exodus 36:5
.
So Moses issued a command, and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp, saying, "Let no man or woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary." Thus the people were restrained from bringing any more. -- exodus 36:6
.
For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it. -- exodus 36:7
.
All the skillful men among those who were performing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet material, with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman, Bezalel made them. -- exodus 36:8
.
The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurements. -- exodus 36:9
.
He joined five curtains to one another and the other five curtains he joined to one another. -- exodus 36:10
.
He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. -- exodus 36:11
.
He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite each other. -- exodus 36:12
.
He made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was a unit. -- exodus 36:13
.
Then he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in all. -- exodus 36:14
.
The length of each curtain was thirty cubits and four cubits the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had the same measurements. -- exodus 36:15
.
He joined five curtains by themselves and the other six curtains by themselves. -- exodus 36:16
.
Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the first set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. -- exodus 36:17
.
He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it would be a unit. -- exodus 36:18
.
He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above. -- exodus 36:19
.
Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright. -- exodus 36:20
.
Ten cubits was the length of each board and one and a half cubits the width of each board. -- exodus 36:21
.
There were two tenons for each board, fitted to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle. -- exodus 36:22
.
He made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side; -- exodus 36:23
.
and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. -- exodus 36:24
.
Then for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, -- exodus 36:25
.
and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board. -- exodus 36:26
.
For the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards. -- exodus 36:27
.
He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear. -- exodus 36:28
.
They were double beneath, and together they were complete to its top to the first ring; thus he did with both of them for the two corners. -- exodus 36:29
.
There were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two under every board. -- exodus 36:30
.
Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle, -- exodus 36:31
.
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the rear side to the west. -- exodus 36:32
.
He made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end. -- exodus 36:33
.
He overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. -- exodus 36:34
.
Moreover, he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman. -- exodus 36:35
.
He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them. -- exodus 36:36
.
He made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver; -- exodus 36:37
.
and he made its five pillars with their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; but their five sockets were of bronze. -- exodus 36:38
.
Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits; -- exodus 37:1
.
and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around. -- exodus 37:2
.
He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; even two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. -- exodus 37:3
.
He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. -- exodus 37:4
.
He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry it. -- exodus 37:5
.
He made a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. -- exodus 37:6
.
He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat; -- exodus 37:7
.
one cherub at the one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at the two ends. -- exodus 37:8
.
The cherubim had their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat. -- exodus 37:9
.
Then he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and one and a half cubits high. -- exodus 37:10
.
He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around. -- exodus 37:11
.
He made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around, and made a gold molding for its rim all around. -- exodus 37:12
.
He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet. -- exodus 37:13
.
Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table. -- exodus 37:14
.
He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table. -- exodus 37:15
.
He made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars, with which to pour out drink offerings, of pure gold. -- exodus 37:16
.
Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers were of one piece with it. -- exodus 37:17
.
There were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it; -- exodus 37:18
.
three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in the other branch--so for the six branches going out of the lampstand. -- exodus 37:19
.
In the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, its bulbs and its flowers; -- exodus 37:20
.
and a bulb was under the first pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the second pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the third pair of branches coming out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand. -- exodus 37:21
.
Their bulbs and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was a single hammered work of pure gold. -- exodus 37:22
.
He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold. -- exodus 37:23
.
He made it and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold. -- exodus 37:24
.
Then he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high; its horns were of one piece with it. -- exodus 37:25
.
He overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and he made a gold molding for it all around. -- exodus 37:26
.
He made two golden rings for it under its molding, on its two sides--on opposite sides--as holders for poles with which to carry it. -- exodus 37:27
.
He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. -- exodus 37:28
.
And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer. -- exodus 37:29
.
Then he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, square, and three cubits high. -- exodus 38:1
.
He made its horns on its four corners, its horns being of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze. -- exodus 38:2
.
He made all the utensils of the altar, the pails and the shovels and the basins, the flesh hooks and the firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze. -- exodus 38:3
.
He made for the altar a grating of bronze network beneath, under its ledge, reaching halfway up. -- exodus 38:4
.
He cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze grating as holders for the poles. -- exodus 38:5
.
He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. -- exodus 38:6
.
He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks. -- exodus 38:7
.
Moreover, he made the laver of bronze with its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- exodus 38:8
.
Then he made the court: for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits; -- exodus 38:9
.
their twenty pillars, and their twenty sockets, made of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. -- exodus 38:10
.
For the north side there were one hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets were of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. -- exodus 38:11
.
For the west side there were hangings of fifty cubits with their ten pillars and their ten sockets; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. -- exodus 38:12
.
For the east side fifty cubits. -- exodus 38:13
.
The hangings for the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets, -- exodus 38:14
.
and so for the other side. On both sides of the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets. -- exodus 38:15
.
All the hangings of the court all around were of fine twisted linen. -- exodus 38:16
.
The sockets for the pillars were of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands, of silver; and the overlaying of their tops, of silver, and all the pillars of the court were furnished with silver bands. -- exodus 38:17
.
The screen of the gate of the court was the work of the weaver, of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen. And the length was twenty cubits and the height was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court. -- exodus 38:18
.
Their four pillars and their four sockets were of bronze; their hooks were of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their bands were of silver. -- exodus 38:19
.
All the pegs of the tabernacle and of the court all around were of bronze. -- exodus 38:20
.
This is the number of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were numbered according to the command of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. -- exodus 38:21
.
Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 38:22
.
With him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman and a weaver in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and fine linen. -- exodus 38:23
.
All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the wave offering, was talents and 730 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. -- exodus 38:24
.
The silver of those of the congregation who were numbered was talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; -- exodus 38:25
.
a beka a head (that is, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary), for each one who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,men. -- exodus 38:26
.
The hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. -- exodus 38:27
.
Of the 1,shekels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and made bands for them. -- exodus 38:28
.
The bronze of the wave offering was talents and 2,400 shekels. -- exodus 38:29
.
With it he made the sockets to the doorway of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar, -- exodus 38:30
.
and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs of the court all around. -- exodus 38:31
.
Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet material, they made finely woven garments for ministering in the holy place as well as the holy garments which were for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:1
.
He made the ephod of gold, and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. -- exodus 39:2
.
Then they hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads to be woven in with the blue and the purple and the scarlet material, and the fine linen, the work of a skillful workman. -- exodus 39:3
.
They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two upper ends. -- exodus 39:4
.
The skillfully woven band which was on it was like its workmanship, of the same material: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:5
.
They made the onyx stones, set in gold filigree settings; they were engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel. -- exodus 39:6
.
And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:7
.
He made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful workman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen. -- exodus 39:8
.
It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a span long and a span wide when folded double. -- exodus 39:9
.
And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row was a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald; -- exodus 39:10
.
and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond; -- exodus 39:11
.
and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; -- exodus 39:12
.
and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in gold filigree settings when they were mounted. -- exodus 39:13
.
The stones were corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve, corresponding to their names, engraved with the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes. -- exodus 39:14
.
They made on the breastpiece chains like cords, of twisted cordage work in pure gold. -- exodus 39:15
.
They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece. -- exodus 39:16
.
Then they put the two gold cords in the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece. -- exodus 39:17
.
They put the other two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. -- exodus 39:18
.
They made two gold rings and placed them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod. -- exodus 39:19
.
Furthermore, they made two gold rings and placed them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to the place where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod. -- exodus 39:20
.
They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be on the woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:21
.
Then he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue; -- exodus 39:22
.
and the opening of the robe was at the top in the center, as the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding all around its opening, so that it would not be torn. -- exodus 39:23
.
They made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet material and twisted linen on the hem of the robe. -- exodus 39:24
.
They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the robe, -- exodus 39:25
.
alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe for the service, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:26
.
They made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons, -- exodus 39:27
.
and the turban of fine linen, and the decorated caps of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twisted linen, -- exodus 39:28
.
and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue and purple and scarlet material, the work of the weaver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:29
.
They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet, "Holy to the LORD." -- exodus 39:30
.
They fastened a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:31
.
Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was completed; and the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did. -- exodus 39:32
.
They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars and its sockets; -- exodus 39:33
.
and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of porpoise skins, and the screening veil; -- exodus 39:34
.
the ark of the testimony and its poles and the mercy seat; -- exodus 39:35
.
the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; -- exodus 39:36
.
the pure gold lampstand, with its arrangement of lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the light; -- exodus 39:37
.
and the gold altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the veil for the doorway of the tent; -- exodus 39:38
.
the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils, the laver and its stand; -- exodus 39:39
.
the hangings for the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords and its pegs and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; -- exodus 39:40
.
the woven garments for ministering in the holy place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests. -- exodus 39:41
.
So the sons of Israel did all the work according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 39:42
.
And Moses examined all the work and behold, they had done it; just as the LORD had commanded, this they had done. So Moses blessed them. -- exodus 39:43
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 40:1
.
"On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. -- exodus 40:2
.
"You shall place the ark of the testimony there, and you shall screen the ark with the veil. -- exodus 40:3
.
"You shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and mount its lamps. -- exodus 40:4
.
"Moreover, you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the veil for the doorway to the tabernacle. -- exodus 40:5
.
"You shall set the altar of burnt offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. -- exodus 40:6
.
"You shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it. -- exodus 40:7
.
"You shall set up the court all around and hang up the veil for the gateway of the court. -- exodus 40:8
.
"Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall consecrate it and all its furnishings; and it shall be holy. -- exodus 40:9
.
"You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, and the altar shall be most holy. -- exodus 40:10
.
"You shall anoint the laver and its stand, and consecrate it. -- exodus 40:11
.
"Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting and wash them with water. -- exodus 40:12
.
"You shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister as a priest to Me. -- exodus 40:13
.
"You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them; -- exodus 40:14
.
and you shall anoint them even as you have anointed their father, that they may minister as priests to Me; and their anointing will qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations." -- exodus 40:15
.
Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did. -- exodus 40:16
.
Now in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was erected. -- exodus 40:17
.
Moses erected the tabernacle and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and inserted its bars and erected its pillars. -- exodus 40:18
.
He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 40:19
.
Then he took the testimony and put it into the ark, and attached the poles to the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark. -- exodus 40:20
.
He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up a veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 40:21
.
Then he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil. -- exodus 40:22
.
He set the arrangement of bread in order on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 40:23
.
Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle. -- exodus 40:24
.
He lighted the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 40:25
.
Then he placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil; -- exodus 40:26
.
and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 40:27
.
Then he set up the veil for the doorway of the tabernacle. -- exodus 40:28
.
He set the altar of burnt offering before the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 40:29
.
He placed the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing. -- exodus 40:30
.
From it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet. -- exodus 40:31
.
When they entered the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- exodus 40:32
.
He erected the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the veil for the gateway of the court. Thus Moses finished the work. -- exodus 40:33
.
Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. -- exodus 40:34
.
Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. -- exodus 40:35
.
Throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel would set out; -- exodus 40:36
.
but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day when it was taken up. -- exodus 40:37
.
For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel. -- exodus 40:38
.
Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying, -- leviticus 1:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock. -- leviticus 1:2
.
'If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer it, a male without defect; he shall offer it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD. -- leviticus 1:3
.
'He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, that it may be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf. -- leviticus 1:4
.
'He shall slay the young bull before the LORD; and Aaron's sons the priests shall offer up the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 1:5
.
'He shall then skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces. -- leviticus 1:6
.
'The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. -- leviticus 1:7
.
'Then Aaron's sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head and the suet over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar. -- leviticus 1:8
.
'Its entrails, however, and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar for a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 1:9
.
'But if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without defect. -- leviticus 1:10
.
'He shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD, and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. -- leviticus 1:11
.
'He shall then cut it into its pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar. -- leviticus 1:12
.
'The entrails, however, and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it, and offer it up in smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 1:13
.
'But if his offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering from the turtledoves or from young pigeons. -- leviticus 1:14
.
'The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head and offer it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar. -- leviticus 1:15
.
'He shall also take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar eastward, to the place of the ashes. -- leviticus 1:16
.
'Then he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not sever it. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the wood which is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 1:17
.
'Now when anyone presents a grain offering as an offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it. -- leviticus 2:1
.
'He shall then bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all of its frankincense. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke as its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 2:2
.
'The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy, of the offerings to the LORD by fire. -- leviticus 2:3
.
'Now when you bring an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil. -- leviticus 2:4
.
'If your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil; -- leviticus 2:5
.
you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. -- leviticus 2:6
.
'Now if your offering is a grain offering made in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. -- leviticus 2:7
.
'When you bring in the grain offering which is made of these things to the LORD, it shall be presented to the priest and he shall bring it to the altar. -- leviticus 2:8
.
'The priest then shall take up from the grain offering its memorial portion, and shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 2:9
.
'The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy of the offerings to the LORD by fire. -- leviticus 2:10
.
'No grain offering, which you bring to the LORD, shall be made with leaven, for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven or any honey as an offering by fire to the LORD. -- leviticus 2:11
.
'As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to the LORD, but they shall not ascend for a soothing aroma on the altar. -- leviticus 2:12
.
'Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your God shall not be lacking from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt. -- leviticus 2:13
.
'Also if you bring a grain offering of early ripened things to the LORD, you shall bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire, grits of new growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened things. -- leviticus 2:14
.
'You shall then put oil on it and lay incense on it; it is a grain offering. -- leviticus 2:15
.
'The priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial portion, part of its grits and its oil with all its incense as an offering by fire to the LORD. -- leviticus 2:16
.
'Now if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he is going to offer out of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without defect before the LORD. -- leviticus 3:1
.
'He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slay it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar. -- leviticus 3:2
.
'From the sacrifice of the peace offerings he shall present an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, -- leviticus 3:3
.
and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. -- leviticus 3:4
.
'Then Aaron's sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 3:5
.
'But if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD is from the flock, he shall offer it, male or female, without defect. -- leviticus 3:6
.
'If he is going to offer a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before the LORD, -- leviticus 3:7
.
and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slay it before the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. -- leviticus 3:8
.
'From the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall bring as an offering by fire to the LORD, its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, -- leviticus 3:9
.
and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. -- leviticus 3:10
.
'Then the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire to the LORD. -- leviticus 3:11
.
'Moreover, if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD, -- leviticus 3:12
.
and he shall lay his hand on its head and slay it before the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. -- leviticus 3:13
.
'From it he shall present his offering as an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, -- leviticus 3:14
.
and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. -- leviticus 3:15
.
'The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire for a soothing aroma; all fat is the LORD'S. -- leviticus 3:16
.
'It is a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you shall not eat any fat or any blood.'" -- leviticus 3:17
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 4:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If a person sins unintentionally in any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and commits any of them, -- leviticus 4:2
.
if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer to the LORD a bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed. -- leviticus 4:3
.
'He shall bring the bull to the doorway of the tent of meeting before the LORD, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slay the bull before the LORD. -- leviticus 4:4
.
'Then the anointed priest is to take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the tent of meeting, -- leviticus 4:5
.
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. -- leviticus 4:6
.
'The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense which is before the LORD in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 4:7
.
'He shall remove from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering: the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails, -- leviticus 4:8
.
and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys -- leviticus 4:9
.
(just as it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings), and the priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering. -- leviticus 4:10
.
'But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and its legs and its entrails and its refuse, -- leviticus 4:11
.
that is, all the rest of the bull, he is to bring out to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned. -- leviticus 4:12
.
'Now if the whole congregation of Israel commits error and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they commit any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty; -- leviticus 4:13
.
when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 4:14
.
'Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD, and the bull shall be slain before the LORD. -- leviticus 4:15
.
'Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting; -- leviticus 4:16
.
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil. -- leviticus 4:17
.
'He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 4:18
.
'He shall remove all its fat from it and offer it up in smoke on the altar. -- leviticus 4:19
.
'He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven. -- leviticus 4:20
.
'Then he is to bring out the bull to a place outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly. -- leviticus 4:21
.
'When a leader sins and unintentionally does any one of all the things which the LORD his God has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty, -- leviticus 4:22
.
if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without defect. -- leviticus 4:23
.
'He shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat and slay it in the place where they slay the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering. -- leviticus 4:24
.
'Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering. -- leviticus 4:25
.
'All its fat he shall offer up in smoke on the altar as in the case of the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven. -- leviticus 4:26
.
'Now if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty, -- leviticus 4:27
.
if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without defect, for his sin which he has committed. -- leviticus 4:28
.
'He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering. -- leviticus 4:29
.
'The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar. -- leviticus 4:30
.
'Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven. -- leviticus 4:31
.
'But if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without defect. -- leviticus 4:32
.
'He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they slay the burnt offering. -- leviticus 4:33
.
'The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar. -- leviticus 4:34
.
'Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven. -- leviticus 4:35
.
'Now if a person sins after he hears a public adjuration to testify when he is a witness, whether he has seen or otherwise known, if he does not tell it, then he will bear his guilt. -- leviticus 5:1
.
'Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast or the carcass of unclean cattle or a carcass of unclean swarming things, though it is hidden from him and he is unclean, then he will be guilty. -- leviticus 5:2
.
'Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort his uncleanness may be with which he becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty. -- leviticus 5:3
.
'Or if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good, in whatever matter a man may speak thoughtlessly with an oath, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty in one of these. -- leviticus 5:4
.
'So it shall be when he becomes guilty in one of these, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned. -- leviticus 5:5
.
'He shall also bring his guilt offering to the LORD for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin. -- leviticus 5:6
.
'But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD his guilt offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. -- leviticus 5:7
.
'He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first that which is for the sin offering and shall nip its head at the front of its neck, but he shall not sever it. -- leviticus 5:8
.
'He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin offering. -- leviticus 5:9
.
'The second he shall then prepare as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has committed, and it will be forgiven him. -- leviticus 5:10
.
'But if his means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil on it or place incense on it, for it is a sin offering. -- leviticus 5:11
.
'He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings of the LORD by fire: it is a sin offering. -- leviticus 5:12
.
'So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven him; then the rest shall become the priest's, like the grain offering.'" -- leviticus 5:13
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 5:14
.
"If a person acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against the LORD'S holy things, then he shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation in silver by shekels, in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering. -- leviticus 5:15
.
"He shall make restitution for that which he has sinned against the holy thing, and shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest. The priest shall then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven him. -- leviticus 5:16
.
"Now if a person sins and does any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, though he was unaware, still he is guilty and shall bear his punishment. -- leviticus 5:17
.
"He is then to bring to the priest a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his error in which he sinned unintentionally and did not know it, and it will be forgiven him. -- leviticus 5:18
.
"It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before the LORD." -- leviticus 5:19
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 6:1
.
"When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD, and deceives his companion in regard to a deposit or a security entrusted to him, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his companion, -- leviticus 6:2
.
or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one of the things a man may do; -- leviticus 6:3
.
then it shall be, when he sins and becomes guilty, that he shall restore what he took by robbery or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted to him or the lost thing which he found, -- leviticus 6:4
.
or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day he presents his guilt offering. -- leviticus 6:5
.
"Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering, -- leviticus 6:6
.
and the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt." -- leviticus 6:7
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 6:8
.
"Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law for the burnt offering: the burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it. -- leviticus 6:9
.
'The priest is to put on his linen robe, and he shall put on undergarments next to his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire reduces the burnt offering on the altar and place them beside the altar. -- leviticus 6:10
.
'Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place. -- leviticus 6:11
.
'The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not go out, but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he shall lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it. -- leviticus 6:12
.
'Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it is not to go out. -- leviticus 6:13
.
'Now this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar. -- leviticus 6:14
.
'Then one of them shall lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering, and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, a soothing aroma, as its memorial offering to the LORD. -- leviticus 6:15
.
'What is left of it Aaron and his sons are to eat. It shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place; they are to eat it in the court of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 6:16
.
'It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their share from My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. -- leviticus 6:17
.
'Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it; it is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to the LORD. Whoever touches them will become consecrated.'" -- leviticus 6:18
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 6:19
.
"This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to present to the LORD on the day when he is anointed; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. -- leviticus 6:20
.
"It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is well stirred, you shall bring it. You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 6:21
.
"The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons shall offer it. By a permanent ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to the LORD. -- leviticus 6:22
.
"So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall not be eaten." -- leviticus 6:23
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 6:24
.
"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is slain the sin offering shall be slain before the LORD; it is most holy. -- leviticus 6:25
.
'The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 6:26
.
'Anyone who touches its flesh will become consecrated; and when any of its blood splashes on a garment, in a holy place you shall wash what was splashed on. -- leviticus 6:27
.
'Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water. -- leviticus 6:28
.
'Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy. -- leviticus 6:29
.
'But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place shall be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. -- leviticus 6:30
.
'Now this is the law of the guilt offering; it is most holy. -- leviticus 7:1
.
'In the place where they slay the burnt offering they are to slay the guilt offering, and he shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. -- leviticus 7:2
.
'Then he shall offer from it all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails, -- leviticus 7:3
.
and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe on the liver he shall remove with the kidneys. -- leviticus 7:4
.
'The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the LORD; it is a guilt offering. -- leviticus 7:5
.
'Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. -- leviticus 7:6
.
'The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one law for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. -- leviticus 7:7
.
'Also the priest who presents any man's burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has presented. -- leviticus 7:8
.
'Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it. -- leviticus 7:9
.
'Every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to all alike. -- leviticus 7:10
.
'Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be presented to the LORD. -- leviticus 7:11
.
'If he offers it by way of thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of well stirred fine flour mixed with oil. -- leviticus 7:12
.
'With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall present his offering with cakes of leavened bread. -- leviticus 7:13
.
'Of this he shall present one of every offering as a contribution to the LORD; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings. -- leviticus 7:14
.
'Now as for the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings, it shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it over until morning. -- leviticus 7:15
.
'But if the sacrifice of his offering is a votive or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what is left of it may be eaten; -- leviticus 7:16
.
but what is left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire. -- leviticus 7:17
.
'So if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings should ever be eaten on the third day, he who offers it will not be accepted, and it will not be reckoned to his benefit. It shall be an offensive thing, and the person who eats of it will bear his own iniquity. -- leviticus 7:18
.
'Also the flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. As for other flesh, anyone who is clean may eat such flesh. -- leviticus 7:19
.
'But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the LORD, in his uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from his people. -- leviticus 7:20
.
'When anyone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, or an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the LORD, that person shall be cut off from his people.'" -- leviticus 7:21
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 7:22
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'You shall not eat any fat from an ox, a sheep or a goat. -- leviticus 7:23
.
'Also the fat of an animal which dies and the fat of an animal torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but you must certainly not eat it. -- leviticus 7:24
.
'For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire is offered to the LORD, even the person who eats shall be cut off from his people. -- leviticus 7:25
.
'You are not to eat any blood, either of bird or animal, in any of your dwellings. -- leviticus 7:26
.
'Any person who eats any blood, even that person shall be cut off from his people.'" -- leviticus 7:27
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 7:28
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings. -- leviticus 7:29
.
'His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to the LORD. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be presented as a wave offering before the LORD. -- leviticus 7:30
.
'The priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons. -- leviticus 7:31
.
'You shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings. -- leviticus 7:32
.
'The one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, the right thigh shall be his as his portion. -- leviticus 7:33
.
'For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their due forever from the sons of Israel. -- leviticus 7:34
.
'This is that which is consecrated to Aaron and that which is consecrated to his sons from the offerings by fire to the LORD, in that day when he presented them to serve as priests to the LORD. -- leviticus 7:35
.
'These the LORD had commanded to be given them from the sons of Israel in the day that He anointed them. It is their due forever throughout their generations.'" -- leviticus 7:36
.
This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering and the ordination offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings, -- leviticus 7:37
.
which the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai in the day that He commanded the sons of Israel to present their offerings to the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai. -- leviticus 7:38
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 8:1
.
"Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread, -- leviticus 8:2
.
and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting." -- leviticus 8:3
.
So Moses did just as the LORD commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the tent of meeting, -- leviticus 8:4
.
Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded to do." -- leviticus 8:5
.
Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and washed them with water. -- leviticus 8:6
.
He put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the artistic band of the ephod, with which he tied it to him. -- leviticus 8:7
.
He then placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim. -- leviticus 8:8
.
He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- leviticus 8:9
.
Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them. -- leviticus 8:10
.
He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them. -- leviticus 8:11
.
Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him, to consecrate him. -- leviticus 8:12
.
Next Moses had Aaron's sons come near and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes and bound caps on them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- leviticus 8:13
.
Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. -- leviticus 8:14
.
Next Moses slaughtered it and took the blood and with his finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar. Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it. -- leviticus 8:15
.
He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar. -- leviticus 8:16
.
But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- leviticus 8:17
.
Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. -- leviticus 8:18
.
Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood around on the altar. -- leviticus 8:19
.
When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Moses offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke. -- leviticus 8:20
.
After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water, Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- leviticus 8:21
.
Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. -- leviticus 8:22
.
Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. -- leviticus 8:23
.
He also had Aaron's sons come near; and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. Moses then sprinkled the rest of the blood around on the altar. -- leviticus 8:24
.
He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh. -- leviticus 8:25
.
From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer, and placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh. -- leviticus 8:26
.
He then put all these on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons and presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. -- leviticus 8:27
.
Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD. -- leviticus 8:28
.
Moses also took the breast and presented it for a wave offering before the LORD; it was Moses' portion of the ram of ordination, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- leviticus 8:29
.
So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. -- leviticus 8:30
.
Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.' -- leviticus 8:31
.
"The remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire. -- leviticus 8:32
.
"You shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will ordain you through seven days. -- leviticus 8:33
.
"The LORD has commanded to do as has been done this day, to make atonement on your behalf. -- leviticus 8:34
.
"At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you shall remain day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the LORD, so that you will not die, for so I have been commanded." -- leviticus 8:35
.
Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD had commanded through Moses. -- leviticus 8:36
.
Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; -- leviticus 9:1
.
and he said to Aaron, "Take for yourself a calf, a bull, for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without defect, and offer them before the LORD. -- leviticus 9:2
.
"Then to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, for a burnt offering, -- leviticus 9:3
.
and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the LORD will appear to you.'" -- leviticus 9:4
.
So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before the LORD. -- leviticus 9:5
.
Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you." -- leviticus 9:6
.
Moses then said to Aaron, "Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering for the people, that you may make atonement for them, just as the LORD has commanded." -- leviticus 9:7
.
So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself. -- leviticus 9:8
.
Aaron's sons presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put some on the horns of the altar, and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. -- leviticus 9:9
.
The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering, he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- leviticus 9:10
.
The flesh and the skin, however, he burned with fire outside the camp. -- leviticus 9:11
.
Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar. -- leviticus 9:12
.
They handed the burnt offering to him in pieces, with the head, and he offered them up in smoke on the altar. -- leviticus 9:13
.
He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar. -- leviticus 9:14
.
Then he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first. -- leviticus 9:15
.
He also presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. -- leviticus 9:16
.
Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his hand with some of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning. -- leviticus 9:17
.
Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar. -- leviticus 9:18
.
As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail, and the fat covering, and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver, -- leviticus 9:19
.
they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar. -- leviticus 9:20
.
But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded. -- leviticus 9:21
.
Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings. -- leviticus 9:22
.
Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. -- leviticus 9:23
.
Then fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces. -- leviticus 9:24
.
Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on it and offered strange fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them. -- leviticus 10:1
.
And fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD. -- leviticus 10:2
.
Then Moses said to Aaron, "It is what the LORD spoke, saying, 'By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honored.'" So Aaron, therefore, kept silent. -- leviticus 10:3
.
Moses called also to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, "Come forward, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp." -- leviticus 10:4
.
So they came forward and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Moses had said. -- leviticus 10:5
.
Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you will not die and that He will not become wrathful against all the congregation. But your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, shall bewail the burning which the LORD has brought about. -- leviticus 10:6
.
"You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting, or you will die; for the LORD'S anointing oil is upon you." So they did according to the word of Moses. -- leviticus 10:7
.
The LORD then spoke to Aaron, saying, -- leviticus 10:8
.
"Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die--it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations-- -- leviticus 10:9
.
and so as to make a distinction between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean, -- leviticus 10:10
.
and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them through Moses." -- leviticus 10:11
.
Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering that is left over from the LORD'S offerings by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy. -- leviticus 10:12
.
"You shall eat it, moreover, in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due out of the LORD'S offerings by fire; for thus I have been commanded. -- leviticus 10:13
.
"The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons' due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel. -- leviticus 10:14
.
"The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present as a wave offering before the LORD; so it shall be a thing perpetually due you and your sons with you, just as the LORD has commanded." -- leviticus 10:15
.
But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up! So he was angry with Aaron's surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying, -- leviticus 10:16
.
"Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear away the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD. -- leviticus 10:17
.
"Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded." -- leviticus 10:18
.
But Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. When things like these happened to me, if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of the LORD?" -- leviticus 10:19
.
When Moses heard that, it seemed good in his sight. -- leviticus 10:20
.
The LORD spoke again to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, -- leviticus 11:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'These are the creatures which you may eat from all the animals that are on the earth. -- leviticus 11:2
.
'Whatever divides a hoof, thus making split hoofs, and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat. -- leviticus 11:3
.
'Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these, among those which chew the cud, or among those which divide the hoof: the camel, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you. -- leviticus 11:4
.
'Likewise, the shaphan, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you; -- leviticus 11:5
.
the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you; -- leviticus 11:6
.
and the pig, for though it divides the hoof, thus making a split hoof, it does not chew cud, it is unclean to you. -- leviticus 11:7
.
'You shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you. -- leviticus 11:8
.
'These you may eat, whatever is in the water: all that have fins and scales, those in the water, in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat. -- leviticus 11:9
.
'But whatever is in the seas and in the rivers that does not have fins and scales among all the teeming life of the water, and among all the living creatures that are in the water, they are detestable things to you, -- leviticus 11:10
.
and they shall be abhorrent to you; you may not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall detest. -- leviticus 11:11
.
'Whatever in the water does not have fins and scales is abhorrent to you. -- leviticus 11:12
.
'These, moreover, you shall detest among the birds; they are abhorrent, not to be eaten: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard, -- leviticus 11:13
.
and the kite and the falcon in its kind, -- leviticus 11:14
.
every raven in its kind, -- leviticus 11:15
.
and the ostrich and the owl and the sea gull and the hawk in its kind, -- leviticus 11:16
.
and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl, -- leviticus 11:17
.
and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture, -- leviticus 11:18
.
and the stork, the heron in its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat. -- leviticus 11:19
.
'All the winged insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you. -- leviticus 11:20
.
'Yet these you may eat among all the winged insects which walk on all fours: those which have above their feet jointed legs with which to jump on the earth. -- leviticus 11:21
.
'These of them you may eat: the locust in its kinds, and the devastating locust in its kinds, and the cricket in its kinds, and the grasshopper in its kinds. -- leviticus 11:22
.
'But all other winged insects which are four-footed are detestable to you. -- leviticus 11:23
.
'By these, moreover, you will be made unclean: whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening, -- leviticus 11:24
.
and whoever picks up any of their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 11:25
.
'Concerning all the animals which divide the hoof but do not make a split hoof, or which do not chew cud, they are unclean to you: whoever touches them becomes unclean. -- leviticus 11:26
.
'Also whatever walks on its paws, among all the creatures that walk on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening, -- leviticus 11:27
.
and the one who picks up their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; they are unclean to you. -- leviticus 11:28
.
'Now these are to you the unclean among the swarming things which swarm on the earth: the mole, and the mouse, and the great lizard in its kinds, -- leviticus 11:29
.
and the gecko, and the crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand reptile, and the chameleon. -- leviticus 11:30
.
'These are to you the unclean among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening. -- leviticus 11:31
.
'Also anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead becomes unclean, including any wooden article, or clothing, or a skin, or a sack--any article of which use is made--it shall be put in the water and be unclean until evening, then it becomes clean. -- leviticus 11:32
.
'As for any earthenware vessel into which one of them may fall, whatever is in it becomes unclean and you shall break the vessel. -- leviticus 11:33
.
'Any of the food which may be eaten, on which water comes, shall become unclean, and any liquid which may be drunk in every vessel shall become unclean. -- leviticus 11:34
.
'Everything, moreover, on which part of their carcass may fall becomes unclean; an oven or a stove shall be smashed; they are unclean and shall continue as unclean to you. -- leviticus 11:35
.
'Nevertheless a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, though the one who touches their carcass shall be unclean. -- leviticus 11:36
.
'If a part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing which is to be sown, it is clean. -- leviticus 11:37
.
'Though if water is put on the seed and a part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you. -- leviticus 11:38
.
'Also if one of the animals dies which you have for food, the one who touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening. -- leviticus 11:39
.
'He too, who eats some of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening, and the one who picks up its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 11:40
.
'Now every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is detestable, not to be eaten. -- leviticus 11:41
.
'Whatever crawls on its belly, and whatever walks on all fours, whatever has many feet, in respect to every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are detestable. -- leviticus 11:42
.
'Do not render yourselves detestable through any of the swarming things that swarm; and you shall not make yourselves unclean with them so that you become unclean. -- leviticus 11:43
.
'For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth. -- leviticus 11:44
.
'For I am the LORD who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God; thus you shall be holy, for I am holy.'" -- leviticus 11:45
.
This is the law regarding the animal and the bird, and every living thing that moves in the waters and everything that swarms on the earth, -- leviticus 11:46
.
to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the edible creature and the creature which is not to be eaten. -- leviticus 11:47
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 12:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying: 'When a woman gives birth and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean for seven days, as in the days of her menstruation she shall be unclean. -- leviticus 12:2
.
'On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. -- leviticus 12:3
.
'Then she shall remain in the blood of her purification for thirty-three days; she shall not touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are completed. -- leviticus 12:4
.
'But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall remain in the blood of her purification for sixty-six days. -- leviticus 12:5
.
'When the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a one year old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering. -- leviticus 12:6
.
'Then he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, whether a male or a female. -- leviticus 12:7
.
'But if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.'" -- leviticus 12:8
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, -- leviticus 13:1
.
"When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests. -- leviticus 13:2
.
"The priest shall look at the mark on the skin of the body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy; when the priest has looked at him, he shall pronounce him unclean. -- leviticus 13:3
.
"But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days. -- leviticus 13:4
.
"The priest shall look at him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the infection has not changed and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days. -- leviticus 13:5
.
"The priest shall look at him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and the mark has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean. -- leviticus 13:6
.
"But if the scab spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again to the priest. -- leviticus 13:7
.
"The priest shall look, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy. -- leviticus 13:8
.
"When the infection of leprosy is on a man, then he shall be brought to the priest. -- leviticus 13:9
.
"The priest shall then look, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling, -- leviticus 13:10
.
it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him, for he is unclean. -- leviticus 13:11
.
"If the leprosy breaks out farther on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of him who has the infection from his head even to his feet, as far as the priest can see, -- leviticus 13:12
.
then the priest shall look, and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; it has all turned white and he is clean. -- leviticus 13:13
.
"But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean. -- leviticus 13:14
.
"The priest shall look at the raw flesh, and he shall pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy. -- leviticus 13:15
.
"Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest, -- leviticus 13:16
.
and the priest shall look at him, and behold, if the infection has turned to white, then the priest shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; he is clean. -- leviticus 13:17
.
"When the body has a boil on its skin and it is healed, -- leviticus 13:18
.
and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white, bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest; -- leviticus 13:19
.
and the priest shall look, and behold, if it appears to be lower than the skin, and the hair on it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil. -- leviticus 13:20
.
"But if the priest looks at it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it and it is not lower than the skin and is faded, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days; -- leviticus 13:21
.
and if it spreads farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection. -- leviticus 13:22
.
"But if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is only the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. -- leviticus 13:23
.
"Or if the body sustains in its skin a burn by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white, -- leviticus 13:24
.
then the priest shall look at it. And if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn. Therefore, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy. -- leviticus 13:25
.
"But if the priest looks at it, and indeed, there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days; -- leviticus 13:26
.
and the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads farther in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy. -- leviticus 13:27
.
"But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is the swelling from the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is only the scar of the burn. -- leviticus 13:28
.
"Now if a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard, -- leviticus 13:29
.
then the priest shall look at the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and there is thin yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scale, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard. -- leviticus 13:30
.
"But if the priest looks at the infection of the scale, and indeed, it appears to be no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the person with the scaly infection for seven days. -- leviticus 13:31
.
"On the seventh day the priest shall look at the infection, and if the scale has not spread and no yellowish hair has grown in it, and the appearance of the scale is no deeper than the skin, -- leviticus 13:32
.
then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scale; and the priest shall isolate the person with the scale seven more days. -- leviticus 13:33
.
"Then on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale, and if the scale has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean. -- leviticus 13:34
.
"But if the scale spreads farther in the skin after his cleansing, -- leviticus 13:35
.
then the priest shall look at him, and if the scale has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellowish hair; he is unclean. -- leviticus 13:36
.
"If in his sight the scale has remained, however, and black hair has grown in it, the scale has healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. -- leviticus 13:37
.
"When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, even white bright spots, -- leviticus 13:38
.
then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their bodies are a faint white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; he is clean. -- leviticus 13:39
.
"Now if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean. -- leviticus 13:40
.
"If his head becomes bald at the front and sides, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean. -- leviticus 13:41
.
"But if on the bald head or the bald forehead, there occurs a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead. -- leviticus 13:42
.
"Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body, -- leviticus 13:43
.
he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head. -- leviticus 13:44
.
"As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache and cry, 'Unclean! Unclean!' -- leviticus 13:45
.
"He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp. -- leviticus 13:46
.
"When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment or a linen garment, -- leviticus 13:47
.
whether in warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in leather or in any article made of leather, -- leviticus 13:48
.
if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark and shall be shown to the priest. -- leviticus 13:49
.
"Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall quarantine the article with the mark for seven days. -- leviticus 13:50
.
"He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather, whatever the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy, it is unclean. -- leviticus 13:51
.
"So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather in which the mark occurs, for it is a leprous malignancy; it shall be burned in the fire. -- leviticus 13:52
.
"But if the priest shall look, and indeed the mark has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, -- leviticus 13:53
.
then the priest shall order them to wash the thing in which the mark occurs and he shall quarantine it for seven more days. -- leviticus 13:54
.
"After the article with the mark has been washed, the priest shall again look, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even though the mark has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether an eating away has produced bareness on the top or on the front of it. -- leviticus 13:55
.
"Then if the priest looks, and if the mark has faded after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the leather, whether from the warp or from the woof; -- leviticus 13:56
.
and if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak; the article with the mark shall be burned in the fire. -- leviticus 13:57
.
"The garment, whether the warp or the woof, or any article of leather from which the mark has departed when you washed it, it shall then be washed a second time and will be clean." -- leviticus 13:58
.
This is the law for the mark of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean. -- leviticus 13:59
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 14:1
.
"This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. Now he shall be brought to the priest, -- leviticus 14:2
.
and the priest shall go out to the outside of the camp. Thus the priest shall look, and if the infection of leprosy has been healed in the leper, -- leviticus 14:3
.
then the priest shall give orders to take two live clean birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop for the one who is to be cleansed. -- leviticus 14:4
.
"The priest shall also give orders to slay the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water. -- leviticus 14:5
.
"As for the live bird, he shall take it together with the cedar wood and the scarlet string and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was slain over the running water. -- leviticus 14:6
.
"He shall then sprinkle seven times the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the live bird go free over the open field. -- leviticus 14:7
.
"The one to be cleansed shall then wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water and be clean. Now afterward, he may enter the camp, but he shall stay outside his tent for seven days. -- leviticus 14:8
.
"It will be on the seventh day that he shall shave off all his hair: he shall shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair. He shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and be clean. -- leviticus 14:9
.
"Now on the eighth day he is to take two male lambs without defect, and a yearling ewe lamb without defect, and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil; -- leviticus 14:10
.
and the priest who pronounces him clean shall present the man to be cleansed and the aforesaid before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 14:11
.
"Then the priest shall take the one male lamb and bring it for a guilt offering, with the log of oil, and present them as a wave offering before the LORD. -- leviticus 14:12
.
"Next he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, at the place of the sanctuary--for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy. -- leviticus 14:13
.
"The priest shall then take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. -- leviticus 14:14
.
"The priest shall also take some of the log of oil, and pour it into his left palm; -- leviticus 14:15
.
the priest shall then dip his right-hand finger into the oil that is in his left palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times before the LORD. -- leviticus 14:16
.
"Of the remaining oil which is in his palm, the priest shall put some on the right ear lobe of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering; -- leviticus 14:17
.
while the rest of the oil that is in the priest's palm, he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD. -- leviticus 14:18
.
"The priest shall next offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Then afterward, he shall slaughter the burnt offering. -- leviticus 14:19
.
"The priest shall offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be clean. -- leviticus 14:20
.
"But if he is poor and his means are insufficient, then he is to take one male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil, -- leviticus 14:21
.
and two turtledoves or two young pigeons which are within his means, the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering. -- leviticus 14:22
.
"Then the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, before the LORD. -- leviticus 14:23
.
"The priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall offer them for a wave offering before the LORD. -- leviticus 14:24
.
"Next he shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. -- leviticus 14:25
.
"The priest shall also pour some of the oil into his left palm; -- leviticus 14:26
.
and with his right-hand finger the priest shall sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before the LORD. -- leviticus 14:27
.
"The priest shall then put some of the oil that is in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering. -- leviticus 14:28
.
"Moreover, the rest of the oil that is in the priest's palm he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement on his behalf before the LORD. -- leviticus 14:29
.
"He shall then offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, which are within his means. -- leviticus 14:30
.
"He shall offer what he can afford, the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. So the priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed. -- leviticus 14:31
.
"This is the law for him in whom there is an infection of leprosy, whose means are limited for his cleansing." -- leviticus 14:32
.
The LORD further spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying: -- leviticus 14:33
.
"When you enter the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a mark of leprosy on a house in the land of your possession, -- leviticus 14:34
.
then the one who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, 'Something like a mark of leprosy has become visible to me in the house.' -- leviticus 14:35
.
"The priest shall then command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to look at the mark, so that everything in the house need not become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to look at the house. -- leviticus 14:36
.
"So he shall look at the mark, and if the mark on the walls of the house has greenish or reddish depressions and appears deeper than the surface, -- leviticus 14:37
.
then the priest shall come out of the house, to the doorway, and quarantine the house for seven days. -- leviticus 14:38
.
"The priest shall return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the mark has indeed spread in the walls of the house, -- leviticus 14:39
.
then the priest shall order them to tear out the stones with the mark in them and throw them away at an unclean place outside the city. -- leviticus 14:40
.
"He shall have the house scraped all around inside, and they shall dump the plaster that they scrape off at an unclean place outside the city. -- leviticus 14:41
.
"Then they shall take other stones and replace those stones, and he shall take other plaster and replaster the house. -- leviticus 14:42
.
"If, however, the mark breaks out again in the house after he has torn out the stones and scraped the house, and after it has been replastered, -- leviticus 14:43
.
then the priest shall come in and make an inspection. If he sees that the mark has indeed spread in the house, it is a malignant mark in the house; it is unclean. -- leviticus 14:44
.
"He shall therefore tear down the house, its stones, and its timbers, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall take them outside the city to an unclean place. -- leviticus 14:45
.
"Moreover, whoever goes into the house during the time that he has quarantined it, becomes unclean until evening. -- leviticus 14:46
.
"Likewise, whoever lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes. -- leviticus 14:47
.
"If, on the other hand, the priest comes in and makes an inspection and the mark has not indeed spread in the house after the house has been replastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the mark has not reappeared. -- leviticus 14:48
.
"To cleanse the house then, he shall take two birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop, -- leviticus 14:49
.
and he shall slaughter the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water. -- leviticus 14:50
.
"Then he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet string, with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird as well as in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. -- leviticus 14:51
.
"He shall thus cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water, along with the live bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet string. -- leviticus 14:52
.
"However, he shall let the live bird go free outside the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it will be clean." -- leviticus 14:53
.
This is the law for any mark of leprosy--even for a scale, -- leviticus 14:54
.
and for the leprous garment or house, -- leviticus 14:55
.
and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot-- -- leviticus 14:56
.
to teach when they are unclean and when they are clean. This is the law of leprosy. -- leviticus 14:57
.
The LORD also spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, -- leviticus 15:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean. -- leviticus 15:2
.
'This, moreover, shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: it is his uncleanness whether his body allows its discharge to flow or whether his body obstructs its discharge. -- leviticus 15:3
.
'Every bed on which the person with the discharge lies becomes unclean, and everything on which he sits becomes unclean. -- leviticus 15:4
.
'Anyone, moreover, who touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening; -- leviticus 15:5
.
and whoever sits on the thing on which the man with the discharge has been sitting, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:6
.
'Also whoever touches the person with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:7
.
'Or if the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean, he too shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:8
.
'Every saddle on which the person with the discharge rides becomes unclean. -- leviticus 15:9
.
'Whoever then touches any of the things which were under him shall be unclean until evening, and he who carries them shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:10
.
'Likewise, whomever the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:11
.
'However, an earthenware vessel which the person with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water. -- leviticus 15:12
.
'Now when the man with the discharge becomes cleansed from his discharge, then he shall count off for himself seven days for his cleansing; he shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water and will become clean. -- leviticus 15:13
.
'Then on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD to the doorway of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest; -- leviticus 15:14
.
and the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD because of his discharge. -- leviticus 15:15
.
'Now if a man has a seminal emission, he shall bathe all his body in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:16
.
'As for any garment or any leather on which there is seminal emission, it shall be washed with water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:17
.
'If a man lies with a woman so that there is a seminal emission, they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:18
.
'When a woman has a discharge, if her discharge in her body is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:19
.
'Everything also on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean. -- leviticus 15:20
.
'Anyone who touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:21
.
'Whoever touches any thing on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:22
.
'Whether it be on the bed or on the thing on which she is sitting, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:23
.
'If a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean. -- leviticus 15:24
.
'Now if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days, not at the period of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond that period, all the days of her impure discharge she shall continue as though in her menstrual impurity; she is unclean. -- leviticus 15:25
.
'Any bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her like her bed at menstruation; and every thing on which she sits shall be unclean, like her uncleanness at that time. -- leviticus 15:26
.
'Likewise, whoever touches them shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening. -- leviticus 15:27
.
'When she becomes clean from her discharge, she shall count off for herself seven days; and afterward she will be clean. -- leviticus 15:28
.
'Then on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them in to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 15:29
.
'The priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on her behalf before the LORD because of her impure discharge.' -- leviticus 15:30
.
"Thus you shall keep the sons of Israel separated from their uncleanness, so that they will not die in their uncleanness by their defiling My tabernacle that is among them." -- leviticus 15:31
.
This is the law for the one with a discharge, and for the man who has a seminal emission so that he is unclean by it, -- leviticus 15:32
.
and for the woman who is ill because of menstrual impurity, and for the one who has a discharge, whether a male or a female, or a man who lies with an unclean woman. -- leviticus 15:33
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they had approached the presence of the LORD and died. -- leviticus 16:1
.
The LORD said to Moses: "Tell your brother Aaron that he shall not enter at any time into the holy place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark, or he will die; for I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat. -- leviticus 16:2
.
"Aaron shall enter the holy place with this: with a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. -- leviticus 16:3
.
"He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarments shall be next to his body, and he shall be girded with the linen sash and attired with the linen turban (these are holy garments). Then he shall bathe his body in water and put them on. -- leviticus 16:4
.
"He shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering. -- leviticus 16:5
.
"Then Aaron shall offer the bull for the sin offering which is for himself, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household. -- leviticus 16:6
.
"He shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- leviticus 16:7
.
"Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for the scapegoat. -- leviticus 16:8
.
"Then Aaron shall offer the goat on which the lot for the LORD fell, and make it a sin offering. -- leviticus 16:9
.
"But the goat on which the lot for the scapegoat fell shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make atonement upon it, to send it into the wilderness as the scapegoat. -- leviticus 16:10
.
"Then Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering which is for himself and make atonement for himself and for his household, and he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself. -- leviticus 16:11
.
"He shall take a firepan full of coals of fire from upon the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it inside the veil. -- leviticus 16:12
.
"He shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the ark of the testimony, otherwise he will die. -- leviticus 16:13
.
"Moreover, he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; also in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times. -- leviticus 16:14
.
"Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat. -- leviticus 16:15
.
"He shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the impurities of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which abides with them in the midst of their impurities. -- leviticus 16:16
.
"When he goes in to make atonement in the holy place, no one shall be in the tent of meeting until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel. -- leviticus 16:17
.
"Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides. -- leviticus 16:18
.
"With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times and cleanse it, and from the impurities of the sons of Israel consecrate it. -- leviticus 16:19
.
"When he finishes atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall offer the live goat. -- leviticus 16:20
.
"Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who stands in readiness. -- leviticus 16:21
.
"The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a solitary land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness. -- leviticus 16:22
.
"Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there. -- leviticus 16:23
.
"He shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes, and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people. -- leviticus 16:24
.
"Then he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar. -- leviticus 16:25
.
"The one who released the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; then afterward he shall come into the camp. -- leviticus 16:26
.
"But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn their hides, their flesh, and their refuse in the fire. -- leviticus 16:27
.
"Then the one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, then afterward he shall come into the camp. -- leviticus 16:28
.
"This shall be a permanent statute for you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall humble your souls and not do any work, whether the native, or the alien who sojourns among you; -- leviticus 16:29
.
for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you; you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD. -- leviticus 16:30
.
"It is to be a sabbath of solemn rest for you, that you may humble your souls; it is a permanent statute. -- leviticus 16:31
.
"So the priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father's place shall make atonement: he shall thus put on the linen garments, the holy garments, -- leviticus 16:32
.
and make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar. He shall also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. -- leviticus 16:33
.
"Now you shall have this as a permanent statute, to make atonement for the sons of Israel for all their sins once every year." And just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so he did. -- leviticus 16:34
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 17:1
.
"Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, 'This is what the LORD has commanded, saying, -- leviticus 17:2
.
"Any man from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it outside the camp, -- leviticus 17:3
.
and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, bloodguiltiness is to be reckoned to that man. He has shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people. -- leviticus 17:4
.
"The reason is so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing in the open field, that they may bring them in to the LORD, at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD. -- leviticus 17:5
.
"The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 17:6
.
"They shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they play the harlot. This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations."' -- leviticus 17:7
.
"Then you shall say to them, 'Any man from the house of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice, -- leviticus 17:8
.
and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to offer it to the LORD, that man also shall be cut off from his people. -- leviticus 17:9
.
'And any man from the house of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people. -- leviticus 17:10
.
'For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement.' -- leviticus 17:11
.
"Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, 'No person among you may eat blood, nor may any alien who sojourns among you eat blood.' -- leviticus 17:12
.
"So when any man from the sons of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, in hunting catches a beast or a bird which may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth. -- leviticus 17:13
.
"For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, 'You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.' -- leviticus 17:14
.
"When any person eats an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or an alien, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening; then he will become clean. -- leviticus 17:15
.
"But if he does not wash them or bathe his body, then he shall bear his guilt." -- leviticus 17:16
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 18:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'I am the LORD your God. -- leviticus 18:2
.
'You shall not do what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, nor are you to do what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes. -- leviticus 18:3
.
'You are to perform My judgments and keep My statutes, to live in accord with them; I am the LORD your God. -- leviticus 18:4
.
'So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, by which a man may live if he does them; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 18:5
.
'None of you shall approach any blood relative of his to uncover nakedness; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 18:6
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother; you are not to uncover her nakedness. -- leviticus 18:7
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness. -- leviticus 18:8
.
'The nakedness of your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether born at home or born outside, their nakedness you shall not uncover. -- leviticus 18:9

'The nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, born to your father, she is your sister, you shall not uncover her nakedness. -- leviticus 18:11
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's blood relative. -- leviticus 18:12
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's blood relative. -- leviticus 18:13
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother; you shall not approach his wife, she is your aunt. -- leviticus 18:14
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness. -- leviticus 18:15
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it is your brother's nakedness. -- leviticus 18:16
.
'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is lewdness. -- leviticus 18:17
.
'You shall not marry a woman in addition to her sister as a rival while she is alive, to uncover her nakedness. -- leviticus 18:18
.
'Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity. -- leviticus 18:19
.
'You shall not have intercourse with your neighbor's wife, to be defiled with her. -- leviticus 18:20
.
'You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 18:21
.
'You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination. -- leviticus 18:22
.
'Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion. -- leviticus 18:23
.
'Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled. -- leviticus 18:24
.
'For the land has become defiled, therefore I have brought its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants. -- leviticus 18:25
.
'But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor the alien who sojourns among you -- leviticus 18:26
.
(for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled); -- leviticus 18:27
.
so that the land will not spew you out, should you defile it, as it has spewed out the nation which has been before you. -- leviticus 18:28
.
'For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people. -- leviticus 18:29
.
'Thus you are to keep My charge, that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am the LORD your God.'" -- leviticus 18:30
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: -- leviticus 19:1
.
"Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy. -- leviticus 19:2
.
'Every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father, and you shall keep My sabbaths; I am the LORD your God. -- leviticus 19:3
.
'Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods; I am the LORD your God. -- leviticus 19:4
.
'Now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted. -- leviticus 19:5
.
'It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire. -- leviticus 19:6
.
'So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an offense; it will not be accepted. -- leviticus 19:7
.
'Everyone who eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from his people. -- leviticus 19:8
.
'Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. -- leviticus 19:9

.
'You shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 19:12

'You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning. -- leviticus 19:13
.
'You shall not curse a deaf man, nor place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall revere your God; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 19:14

.
'Now if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave acquired for another man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, however, be put to death, because she was not free. -- leviticus 19:20
.
'He shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD to the doorway of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt offering. -- leviticus 19:21
.
'The priest shall also make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin which he has committed, and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him. -- leviticus 19:22
.
'When you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten. -- leviticus 19:23
.
'But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD. -- leviticus 19:24
.

'You shall thus observe all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them; I am the LORD.'" -- leviticus 19:37
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 20:1
.
"You shall also say to the sons of Israel: 'Any man from the sons of Israel or from the aliens sojourning in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech, shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. -- leviticus 20:2
.
'I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name. -- leviticus 20:3
.
'If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his offspring to Molech, so as not to put him to death, -- leviticus 20:4

.
'If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them. -- leviticus 20:13
.
'If there is a man who marries a woman and her mother, it is immorality; both he and they shall be burned with fire, so that there will be no immorality in your midst. -- leviticus 20:14

.
'If there is a man who takes his sister, his father's daughter or his mother's daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he bears his guilt. -- leviticus 20:17
.
'If there is a man who lies with a menstruous woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has exposed the flow of her blood; thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people. -- leviticus 20:18
.
'You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for such a one has made naked his blood relative; they will bear their guilt. -- leviticus 20:19
.
'If there is a man who lies with his uncle's wife he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless. -- leviticus 20:20
.
'If there is a man who takes his brother's wife, it is abhorrent; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness. They will be childless. -- leviticus 20:21

'You are therefore to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out. -- leviticus 20:22
.
'Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I will drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them. -- leviticus 20:23
.
'Hence I have said to you, "You are to possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey." I am the LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples. -- leviticus 20:24
.
'You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean. -- leviticus 20:25
.

.
'Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones, their bloodguiltiness is upon them.'" -- leviticus 20:27
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: 'No one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people, -- leviticus 21:1
.
except for his relatives who are nearest to him, his mother and his father and his son and his daughter and his brother, -- leviticus 21:2
.
also for his virgin sister, who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may defile himself. -- leviticus 21:3
.
'He shall not defile himself as a relative by marriage among his people, and so profane himself. -- leviticus 21:4
.
'They shall not make any baldness on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh. -- leviticus 21:5
.
'They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they present the offerings by fire to the LORD, the food of their God; so they shall be holy. -- leviticus 21:6
.
'They shall not take a woman who is profaned by harlotry, nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God. -- leviticus 21:7
.
'You shall consecrate him, therefore, for he offers the food of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I the LORD, who sanctifies you, am holy. -- leviticus 21:8
.
'Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by harlotry, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire. -- leviticus 21:9
.
'The priest who is the highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes; -- leviticus 21:10
.
nor shall he approach any dead person, nor defile himself even for his father or his mother; -- leviticus 21:11
.
nor shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 21:12
.
'He shall take a wife in her virginity. -- leviticus 21:13
.
'A widow, or a divorced woman, or one who is profaned by harlotry, these he may not take; but rather he is to marry a virgin of his own people, -- leviticus 21:14
.
so that he will not profane his offspring among his people; for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.'" -- leviticus 21:15
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 21:16
.
"Speak to Aaron, saying, 'No man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect shall approach to offer the food of his God. -- leviticus 21:17
.
'For no one who has a defect shall approach: a blind man, or a lame man, or he who has a disfigured face, or any deformed limb, -- leviticus 21:18
.
or a man who has a broken foot or broken hand, -- leviticus 21:19
.
or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or crushed testicles. -- leviticus 21:20
.
'No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a defect is to come near to offer the LORD'S offerings by fire; since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the food of his God. -- leviticus 21:21
.
'He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy, -- leviticus 21:22
.
only he shall not go in to the veil or come near the altar because he has a defect, so that he will not profane My sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.'" -- leviticus 21:23
.
So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel. -- leviticus 21:24
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 22:1
.
"Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to Me, so as not to profane My holy name; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 22:2
.
"Say to them, 'If any man among all your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy gifts which the sons of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from before Me; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 22:3
.
'No man of the descendants of Aaron, who is a leper or who has a discharge, may eat of the holy gifts until he is clean. And if one touches anything made unclean by a corpse or if a man has a seminal emission, -- leviticus 22:4
.
or if a man touches any teeming things by which he is made unclean, or any man by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness; -- leviticus 22:5
.
a person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy gifts unless he has bathed his body in water. -- leviticus 22:6
.
'But when the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward he shall eat of the holy gifts, for it is his food. -- leviticus 22:7
.
'He shall not eat an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, becoming unclean by it; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 22:8
.
'They shall therefore keep My charge, so that they will not bear sin because of it and die thereby because they profane it; I am the LORD who sanctifies them. -- leviticus 22:9
.
'No layman, however, is to eat the holy gift; a sojourner with the priest or a hired man shall not eat of the holy gift. -- leviticus 22:10
.
'But if a priest buys a slave as his property with his money, that one may eat of it, and those who are born in his house may eat of his food. -- leviticus 22:11
.
'If a priest's daughter is married to a layman, she shall not eat of the offering of the gifts. -- leviticus 22:12
.
'But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or divorced, and has no child and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's food; but no layman shall eat of it. -- leviticus 22:13
.
'But if a man eats a holy gift unintentionally, then he shall add to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy gift to the priest. -- leviticus 22:14
.
'They shall not profane the holy gifts of the sons of Israel which they offer to the LORD, -- leviticus 22:15
.
and so cause them to bear punishment for guilt by eating their holy gifts; for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.'" -- leviticus 22:16
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 22:17
.
"Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, 'Any man of the house of Israel or of the aliens in Israel who presents his offering, whether it is any of their votive or any of their freewill offerings, which they present to the LORD for a burnt offering-- -- leviticus 22:18
.
for you to be accepted--it must be a male without defect from the cattle, the sheep, or the goats. -- leviticus 22:19
.
'Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it will not be accepted for you. -- leviticus 22:20
.
'When a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a special vow or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it. -- leviticus 22:21
.
'Those that are blind or fractured or maimed or having a running sore or eczema or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD, nor make of them an offering by fire on the altar to the LORD. -- leviticus 22:22
.
'In respect to an ox or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted member, you may present it for a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted. -- leviticus 22:23
.
'Also anything with its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not offer to the LORD, or sacrifice in your land, -- leviticus 22:24
.
nor shall you accept any such from the hand of a foreigner for offering as the food of your God; for their corruption is in them, they have a defect, they shall not be accepted for you.'" -- leviticus 22:25
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 22:26
.
"When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to the LORD. -- leviticus 22:27
.
"But, whether it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not kill both it and its young in one day. -- leviticus 22:28
.
"When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted. -- leviticus 22:29
.
"It shall be eaten on the same day, you shall leave none of it until morning; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 22:30
.
"So you shall keep My commandments, and do them; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 22:31
.
"You shall not profane My holy name, but I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel; I am the LORD who sanctifies you, -- leviticus 22:32
.
who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to be your God; I am the LORD." -- leviticus 22:33
.
The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 23:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD'S appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy convocations--My appointed times are these: -- leviticus 23:2
.
'For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings. -- leviticus 23:3
.
'These are the appointed times of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them. -- leviticus 23:4
.
'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the LORD'S Passover. -- leviticus 23:5
.
'Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. -- leviticus 23:6
.
'On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work. -- leviticus 23:7
.
'But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.'" -- leviticus 23:8
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 23:9
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land which I am going to give to you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. -- leviticus 23:10
.
'He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD for you to be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. -- leviticus 23:11
.
'Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD. -- leviticus 23:12
.
'Its grain offering shall then be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the LORD for a soothing aroma, with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine. -- leviticus 23:13
.
'Until this same day, until you have brought in the offering of your God, you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new growth. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places. -- leviticus 23:14
.
'You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete sabbaths. -- leviticus 23:15
.
'You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD. -- leviticus 23:16
.
'You shall bring in from your dwelling places two loaves of bread for a wave offering, made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of a fine flour, baked with leaven as first fruits to the LORD. -- leviticus 23:17
.
'Along with the bread you shall present seven one year old male lambs without defect, and a bull of the herd and two rams; they are to be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- leviticus 23:18
.
'You shall also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male lambs one year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings. -- leviticus 23:19
.
'The priest shall then wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering with two lambs before the LORD; they are to be holy to the LORD for the priest. -- leviticus 23:20
.
'On this same day you shall make a proclamation as well; you are to have a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work. It is to be a perpetual statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations. -- leviticus 23:21
.
'When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you are to leave them for the needy and the alien. I am the LORD your God.'" -- leviticus 23:22
.
Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 23:23
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'In the seventh month on the first of the month you shall have a rest, a reminder by blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. -- leviticus 23:24
.
'You shall not do any laborious work, but you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.'" -- leviticus 23:25
.
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 23:26
.
"On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble your souls and present an offering by fire to the LORD. -- leviticus 23:27
.
"You shall not do any work on this same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God. -- leviticus 23:28
.
"If there is any person who will not humble himself on this same day, he shall be cut off from his people. -- leviticus 23:29
.
"As for any person who does any work on this same day, that person I will destroy from among his people. -- leviticus 23:30
.
"You shall do no work at all. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places. -- leviticus 23:31
.
"It is to be a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall humble your souls; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening you shall keep your sabbath." -- leviticus 23:32
.
Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 23:33
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'On the fifteenth of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the LORD. -- leviticus 23:34
.
'On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work of any kind. -- leviticus 23:35
.
'For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD; it is an assembly. You shall do no laborious work. -- leviticus 23:36
.
'These are the appointed times of the LORD which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present offerings by fire to the LORD--burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each day's matter on its own day-- -- leviticus 23:37
.
besides those of the sabbaths of the LORD, and besides your gifts and besides all your votive and freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD. -- leviticus 23:38
.
'On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD for seven days, with a rest on the first day and a rest on the eighth day. -- leviticus 23:39
.
'Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days. -- leviticus 23:40
.
'You shall thus celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month. -- leviticus 23:41
.
'You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel shall live in booths, -- leviticus 23:42
.
so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.'" -- leviticus 23:43
.
So Moses declared to the sons of Israel the appointed times of the LORD. -- leviticus 23:44
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 24:1
.
"Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually. -- leviticus 24:2
.
"Outside the veil of testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the LORD continually; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations. -- leviticus 24:3
.
"He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually. -- leviticus 24:4
.
"Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake. -- leviticus 24:5
.
"You shall set them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure gold table before the LORD. -- leviticus 24:6
.
"You shall put pure frankincense on each row that it may be a memorial portion for the bread, even an offering by fire to the LORD. -- leviticus 24:7
.
"Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is an everlasting covenant for the sons of Israel. -- leviticus 24:8
.
"It shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him from the LORD'S offerings by fire, his portion forever." -- leviticus 24:9
.
Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel; and the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel struggled with each other in the camp. -- leviticus 24:10
.
The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.) -- leviticus 24:11
.
They put him in custody so that the command of the LORD might be made clear to them. -- leviticus 24:12
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 24:13
.
"Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him. -- leviticus 24:14
.
"You shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If anyone curses his God, then he will bear his sin. -- leviticus 24:15
.
'Moreover, the one who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him. The alien as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. -- leviticus 24:16
.
'If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death. -- leviticus 24:17
.
'The one who takes the life of an animal shall make it good, life for life. -- leviticus 24:18
.
'If a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so it shall be done to him: -- leviticus 24:19
.
fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so it shall be inflicted on him. -- leviticus 24:20
.
'Thus the one who kills an animal shall make it good, but the one who kills a man shall be put to death. -- leviticus 24:21
.
'There shall be one standard for you; it shall be for the stranger as well as the native, for I am the LORD your God.'" -- leviticus 24:22
.
Then Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the sons of Israel did, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- leviticus 24:23
.
The LORD then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, -- leviticus 25:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you come into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the LORD. -- leviticus 25:2
.
'Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop, -- leviticus 25:3
.
but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the LORD; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard. -- leviticus 25:4
.
'Your harvest's aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical year. -- leviticus 25:5
.
'All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food; yourself, and your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your foreign resident, those who live as aliens with you. -- leviticus 25:6
.
'Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat. -- leviticus 25:7
.
'You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years. -- leviticus 25:8
.
'You shall then sound a ram's horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. -- leviticus 25:9
.
'You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. -- leviticus 25:10
.
'You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. -- leviticus 25:11
.
'For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field. -- leviticus 25:12
.
'On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property. -- leviticus 25:13
.
'If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend's hand, you shall not wrong one another. -- leviticus 25:14
.
'Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops. -- leviticus 25:15
.
'In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of crops he is selling to you. -- leviticus 25:16
.
'So you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the LORD your God. -- leviticus 25:17
.
'You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry them out, that you may live securely on the land. -- leviticus 25:18
.
'Then the land will yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it. -- leviticus 25:19
.
'But if you say, "What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our crops?" -- leviticus 25:20
.
then I will so order My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years. -- leviticus 25:21
.
'When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop, eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in. -- leviticus 25:22
.
'The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me. -- leviticus 25:23
.
'Thus for every piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land. -- leviticus 25:24
.
'If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of his property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his relative has sold. -- leviticus 25:25
.
'Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his means as to find sufficient for its redemption, -- leviticus 25:26
.
then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his property. -- leviticus 25:27
.
'But if he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall revert, that he may return to his property. -- leviticus 25:28
.
'Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right of redemption lasts a full year. -- leviticus 25:29
.
'But if it is not bought back for him within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not revert in the jubilee. -- leviticus 25:30
.
'The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption rights and revert in the jubilee. -- leviticus 25:31
.
'As for cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession. -- leviticus 25:32
.
'What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel. -- leviticus 25:33
.
'But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their perpetual possession. -- leviticus 25:34
.
'Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you. -- leviticus 25:35
.
'Do not take usurious interest from him, but revere your God, that your countryman may live with you. -- leviticus 25:36
.
'You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. -- leviticus 25:37
.
'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God. -- leviticus 25:38
.
'If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave's service. -- leviticus 25:39
.
'He shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee. -- leviticus 25:40
.
'He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers. -- leviticus 25:41
.
'For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. -- leviticus 25:42
.
'You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. -- leviticus 25:43
.
'As for your male and female slaves whom you may have--you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. -- leviticus 25:44
.
'Then, too, it is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession. -- leviticus 25:45
.
'You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one another. -- leviticus 25:46
.
'Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the descendants of a stranger's family, -- leviticus 25:47
.
then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, -- leviticus 25:48
.
or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. -- leviticus 25:49
.
'He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be with him. -- leviticus 25:50
.
'If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; -- leviticus 25:51
.
and if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption. -- leviticus 25:52
.
'Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule over him with severity in your sight. -- leviticus 25:53
.
'Even if he is not redeemed by these means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him. -- leviticus 25:54
.
'For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God. -- leviticus 25:55
.
'You shall not make for yourselves idols, nor shall you set up for yourselves an image or a sacred pillar, nor shall you place a figured stone in your land to bow down to it; for I am the LORD your God. -- leviticus 26:1
.
'You shall keep My sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary; I am the LORD. -- leviticus 26:2
.
'If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to carry them out, -- leviticus 26:3
.
then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit. -- leviticus 26:4
.
'Indeed, your threshing will last for you until grape gathering, and grape gathering will last until sowing time. You will thus eat your food to the full and live securely in your land. -- leviticus 26:5
.
'I shall also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down with no one making you tremble. I shall also eliminate harmful beasts from the land, and no sword will pass through your land. -- leviticus 26:6
.
'But you will chase your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword; -- leviticus 26:7
.
five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword. -- leviticus 26:8
.
'So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you. -- leviticus 26:9
.
'You will eat the old supply and clear out the old because of the new. -- leviticus 26:10
.
'Moreover, I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not reject you. -- leviticus 26:11
.
'I will also walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people. -- leviticus 26:12
.
'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be their slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect. -- leviticus 26:13
.
'But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these commandments, -- leviticus 26:14
.
if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, and so break My covenant, -- leviticus 26:15
.
I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat it up. -- leviticus 26:16
.
'I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you. -- leviticus 26:17
.
'If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. -- leviticus 26:18
.
'I will also break down your pride of power; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze. -- leviticus 26:19
.
'Your strength will be spent uselessly, for your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit. -- leviticus 26:20
.
'If then, you act with hostility against Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins. -- leviticus 26:21
.
'I will let loose among you the beasts of the field, which will bereave you of your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your number so that your roads lie deserted. -- leviticus 26:22
.
'And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with hostility against Me, -- leviticus 26:23
.
then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even I, will strike you seven times for your sins. -- leviticus 26:24
.
'I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy hands. -- leviticus 26:25
.
'When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts, so that you will eat and not be satisfied. -- leviticus 26:26
.
'Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act with hostility against Me, -- leviticus 26:27
.
then I will act with wrathful hostility against you, and I, even I, will punish you seven times for your sins. -- leviticus 26:28
.
'Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters you will eat. -- leviticus 26:29
.
'I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols, for My soul shall abhor you. -- leviticus 26:30
.
'I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas. -- leviticus 26:31
.
'I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it will be appalled over it. -- leviticus 26:32
.
'You, however, I will scatter among the nations and will draw out a sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become waste. -- leviticus 26:33
.
'Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, while you are in your enemies' land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths. -- leviticus 26:34
.
'All the days of its desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it. -- leviticus 26:35
.
'As for those of you who may be left, I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them, and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the sword, and they will fall. -- leviticus 26:36
.
'They will therefore stumble over each other as if running from the sword, although no one is pursuing; and you will have no strength to stand up before your enemies. -- leviticus 26:37
.
'But you will perish among the nations, and your enemies' land will consume you. -- leviticus 26:38
.
'So those of you who may be left will rot away because of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the iniquities of their forefathers they will rot away with them. -- leviticus 26:39
.
'If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their forefathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also in their acting with hostility against Me-- -- leviticus 26:40
.
I also was acting with hostility against them, to bring them into the land of their enemies--or if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make amends for their iniquity, -- leviticus 26:41
.
then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham as well, and I will remember the land. -- leviticus 26:42
.
'For the land will be abandoned by them, and will make up for its sabbaths while it is made desolate without them. They, meanwhile, will be making amends for their iniquity, because they rejected My ordinances and their soul abhorred My statutes. -- leviticus 26:43
.
'Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so abhor them as to destroy them, breaking My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God. -- leviticus 26:44
.
'But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.'" -- leviticus 26:45
.
These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the LORD established between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai. -- leviticus 26:46
.
Again, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- leviticus 27:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When a man makes a difficult vow, he shall be valued according to your valuation of persons belonging to the LORD. -- leviticus 27:2
.
'If your valuation is of the male from twenty years even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. -- leviticus 27:3
.
'Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. -- leviticus 27:4
.
'If it be from five years even to twenty years old then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels. -- leviticus 27:5
.
'But if they are from a month even up to five years old, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver. -- leviticus 27:6
.
'If they are from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. -- leviticus 27:7
.
'But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be placed before the priest and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him. -- leviticus 27:8
.
'Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the LORD, any such that one gives to the LORD shall be holy. -- leviticus 27:9
.
'He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; or if he does exchange animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall become holy. -- leviticus 27:10
.
'If, however, it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an offering to the LORD, then he shall place the animal before the priest. -- leviticus 27:11
.
'The priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be. -- leviticus 27:12
.
'But if he should ever wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation. -- leviticus 27:13
.
'Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand. -- leviticus 27:14
.
'Yet if the one who consecrates it should wish to redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his. -- leviticus 27:15
.
'Again, if a man consecrates to the LORD part of the fields of his own property, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver. -- leviticus 27:16
.
'If he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand. -- leviticus 27:17
.
'If he consecrates his field after the jubilee, however, then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation. -- leviticus 27:18
.
'If the one who consecrates it should ever wish to redeem the field, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may pass to him. -- leviticus 27:19
.
'Yet if he will not redeem the field, but has sold the field to another man, it may no longer be redeemed; -- leviticus 27:20
.
and when it reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to the LORD, like a field set apart; it shall be for the priest as his property. -- leviticus 27:21
.
'Or if he consecrates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of the field of his own property, -- leviticus 27:22
.
then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee; and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to the LORD. -- leviticus 27:23
.
'In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, to whom the possession of the land belongs. -- leviticus 27:24
.
'Every valuation of yours, moreover, shall be after the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs. -- leviticus 27:25
.
'However, a firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may consecrate it; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD'S. -- leviticus 27:26
.
'But if it is among the unclean animals, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation and add to it one-fifth of it; and if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation. -- leviticus 27:27
.
'Nevertheless, anything which a man sets apart to the LORD out of all that he has, of man or animal or of the fields of his own property, shall not be sold or redeemed. Anything devoted to destruction is most holy to the LORD. -- leviticus 27:28
.
'No one who may have been set apart among men shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death. -- leviticus 27:29
.
'Thus all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S; it is holy to the LORD. -- leviticus 27:30
.
'If, therefore, a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he shall add to it one-fifth of it. -- leviticus 27:31
.
'For every tenth part of herd or flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to the LORD. -- leviticus 27:32
.
'He is not to be concerned whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange it; or if he does exchange it, then both it and its substitute shall become holy. It shall not be redeemed.'" -- leviticus 27:33
.
These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai. -- leviticus 27:34
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, -- numbers 1:1
.
"Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, every male, head by head -- numbers 1:2
.
from twenty years old and upward, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies. -- numbers 1:3
.
"With you, moreover, there shall be a man of each tribe, each one head of his father's household. -- numbers 1:4
.
"These then are the names of the men who shall stand with you: of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur; -- numbers 1:5
.
of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai; -- numbers 1:6
.
of Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab; -- numbers 1:7
.
of Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar; -- numbers 1:8
.
of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon; -- numbers 1:9
.
of the sons of Joseph: of Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; of Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur; -- numbers 1:10
.
of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni; -- numbers 1:11
.
of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai; -- numbers 1:12
.
of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran; -- numbers 1:13
.
of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel; -- numbers 1:14
.
of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan. -- numbers 1:15
.
"These are they who were called of the congregation, the leaders of their fathers' tribes; they were the heads of divisions of Israel." -- numbers 1:16
.
So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name, -- numbers 1:17
.
and they assembled all the congregation together on the first of the second month. Then they registered by ancestry in their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, head by head, -- numbers 1:18
.
just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai. -- numbers 1:19
.
Now the sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:20
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Reuben were 46,500. -- numbers 1:21
.
Of the sons of Simeon, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, their numbered men, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:22
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Simeon were 59,300. -- numbers 1:23
.
Of the sons of Gad, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:24
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Gad were 45,650. -- numbers 1:25
.
Of the sons of Judah, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:26
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Judah were 74,600. -- numbers 1:27
.
Of the sons of Issachar, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:28
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Issachar were 54,400. -- numbers 1:29
.
Of the sons of Zebulun, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:30
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Zebulun were 57,400. -- numbers 1:31
.
Of the sons of Joseph, namely, of the sons of Ephraim, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:32
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Ephraim were 40,500. -- numbers 1:33
.
Of the sons of Manasseh, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:34
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Manasseh were 32,200. -- numbers 1:35
.
Of the sons of Benjamin, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:36
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Benjamin were 35,400. -- numbers 1:37
.
Of the sons of Dan, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:38
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Dan were 62,700. -- numbers 1:39
.
Of the sons of Asher, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:40
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Asher were 41,500. -- numbers 1:41
.
Of the sons of Naphtali, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war, -- numbers 1:42
.
their numbered men of the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400. -- numbers 1:43
.
These are the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each of whom was of his father's household. -- numbers 1:44
.
So all the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers' households, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war in Israel, -- numbers 1:45
.
even all the numbered men were 603,550. -- numbers 1:46
.
The Levites, however, were not numbered among them by their fathers' tribe. -- numbers 1:47
.
For the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying, -- numbers 1:48
.
"Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall you take their census among the sons of Israel. -- numbers 1:49
.
"But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it; they shall also camp around the tabernacle. -- numbers 1:50
.
"So when the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites shall set it up. But the layman who comes near shall be put to death. -- numbers 1:51
.
"The sons of Israel shall camp, each man by his own camp, and each man by his own standard, according to their armies. -- numbers 1:52
.
"But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there will be no wrath on the congregation of the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the testimony." -- numbers 1:53
.
Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all which the LORD had commanded Moses, so they did. -- numbers 1:54
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, -- numbers 2:1
.
"The sons of Israel shall camp, each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers' households; they shall camp around the tent of meeting at a distance. -- numbers 2:2
.
"Now those who camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab, -- numbers 2:3
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 74,600. -- numbers 2:4
.
"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, and the leader of the sons of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar, -- numbers 2:5
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 54,400. -- numbers 2:6
.
"Then comes the tribe of Zebulun, and the leader of the sons of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon, -- numbers 2:7
.
and his army, even his numbered men, 57,400. -- numbers 2:8
.
"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Judah: 186,400, by their armies. They shall set out first. -- numbers 2:9
.
"On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur, -- numbers 2:10
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 46,500. -- numbers 2:11
.
"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the sons of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai, -- numbers 2:12
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 59,300. -- numbers 2:13
.
"Then comes the tribe of Gad, and the leader of the sons of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel, -- numbers 2:14
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 45,650. -- numbers 2:15
.
"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Reuben: 151,by their armies. And they shall set out second. -- numbers 2:16
.
"Then the tent of meeting shall set out with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; just as they camp, so they shall set out, every man in his place by their standards. -- numbers 2:17
.
"On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud, -- numbers 2:18
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 40,500. -- numbers 2:19
.
"Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, and the leader of the sons of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, -- numbers 2:20
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 32,200. -- numbers 2:21
.
"Then comes the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the sons of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni, -- numbers 2:22
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 35,400. -- numbers 2:23
.
"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Ephraim: 108,100, by their armies. And they shall set out third. -- numbers 2:24
.
"On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Dan: Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, -- numbers 2:25
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 62,700. -- numbers 2:26
.
"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, and the leader of the sons of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ochran, -- numbers 2:27
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 41,500. -- numbers 2:28
.
"Then comes the tribe of Naphtali, and the leader of the sons of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan, -- numbers 2:29
.
and his army, even their numbered men, 53,400. -- numbers 2:30
.
"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Dan was 157,600. They shall set out last by their standards." -- numbers 2:31
.
These are the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers' households; the total of the numbered men of the camps by their armies, 603,550. -- numbers 2:32
.
The Levites, however, were not numbered among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 2:33
.
Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, every one by his family according to his father's household. -- numbers 2:34
.
Now these are the records of the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai. -- numbers 3:1
.
These then are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. -- numbers 3:2
.
These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to serve as priests. -- numbers 3:3
.
But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered strange fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron. -- numbers 3:4
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 3:5
.
"Bring the tribe of Levi near and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him. -- numbers 3:6
.
"They shall perform the duties for him and for the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. -- numbers 3:7
.
"They shall also keep all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, along with the duties of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. -- numbers 3:8
.
"You shall thus give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the sons of Israel. -- numbers 3:9
.
"So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep their priesthood, but the layman who comes near shall be put to death." -- numbers 3:10
.
Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 3:11
.
"Now, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn, the first issue of the womb among the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall be Mine. -- numbers 3:12
.
"For all the firstborn are Mine; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, from man to beast. They shall be Mine; I am the LORD." -- numbers 3:13
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, -- numbers 3:14
.
"Number the sons of Levi by their fathers' households, by their families; every male from a month old and upward you shall number." -- numbers 3:15
.
So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, just as he had been commanded. -- numbers 3:16
.
These then are the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon and Kohath and Merari. -- numbers 3:17
.
These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei; -- numbers 3:18
.
and the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel; -- numbers 3:19
.
and the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' households. -- numbers 3:20
.
Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; these were the families of the Gershonites. -- numbers 3:21
.
Their numbered men, in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, even their numbered men were 7,500. -- numbers 3:22
.
The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle westward, -- numbers 3:23
.
and the leader of the fathers' households of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael. -- numbers 3:24
.
Now the duties of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting, -- numbers 3:25
.
and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords, according to all the service concerning them. -- numbers 3:26
.
Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites and the family of the Izharites and the family of the Hebronites and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites. -- numbers 3:27
.
In the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, there were 8,600, performing the duties of the sanctuary. -- numbers 3:28
.
The families of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the southward side of the tabernacle, -- numbers 3:29
.
and the leader of the fathers' households of the Kohathite families was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. -- numbers 3:30
.
Now their duties involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister, and the screen, and all the service concerning them; -- numbers 3:31
.
and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was the chief of the leaders of Levi, and had the oversight of those who perform the duties of the sanctuary. -- numbers 3:32
.
Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari. -- numbers 3:33
.
Their numbered men in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, were 6,200. -- numbers 3:34
.
The leader of the fathers' households of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were to camp on the northward side of the tabernacle. -- numbers 3:35
.
Now the appointed duties of the sons of Merari involved the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, all its equipment, and the service concerning them, -- numbers 3:36
.
and the pillars around the court with their sockets and their pegs and their cords. -- numbers 3:37
.
Now those who were to camp before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, are Moses and Aaron and his sons, performing the duties of the sanctuary for the obligation of the sons of Israel; but the layman coming near was to be put to death. -- numbers 3:38
.
All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the command of the LORD by their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000. -- numbers 3:39
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a month old and upward, and make a list of their names. -- numbers 3:40
.
"You shall take the Levites for Me, I am the LORD, instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel." -- numbers 3:41
.
So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded him; -- numbers 3:42
.
and all the firstborn males by the number of names from a month old and upward, for their numbered men were 22,273. -- numbers 3:43
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 3:44
.
"Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel and the cattle of the Levites. And the Levites shall be Mine; I am the LORD. -- numbers 3:45
.
"For the ransom of the of the firstborn of the sons of Israel who are in excess beyond the Levites, -- numbers 3:46
.
you shall take five shekels apiece, per head; you shall take them in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), -- numbers 3:47
.
and give the money, the ransom of those who are in excess among them, to Aaron and to his sons." -- numbers 3:48
.
So Moses took the ransom money from those who were in excess, beyond those ransomed by the Levites; -- numbers 3:49
.
from the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, 1,365. -- numbers 3:50
.
Then Moses gave the ransom money to Aaron and to his sons, at the command of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 3:51
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, -- numbers 4:1
.
"Take a census of the descendants of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' households, -- numbers 4:2
.
from thirty years and upward, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tent of meeting. -- numbers 4:3
.
"This is the work of the descendants of Kohath in the tent of meeting, concerning the most holy things. -- numbers 4:4
.
"When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and they shall take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it; -- numbers 4:5
.
and they shall lay a covering of porpoise skin on it, and shall spread over it a cloth of pure blue, and shall insert its poles. -- numbers 4:6
.
"Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall also spread a cloth of blue and put on it the dishes and the pans and the sacrificial bowls and the jars for the drink offering, and the continual bread shall be on it. -- numbers 4:7
.
"They shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet material, and cover the same with a covering of porpoise skin, and they shall insert its poles. -- numbers 4:8
.
"Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps and its snuffers, and its trays and all its oil vessels, by which they serve it; -- numbers 4:9
.
and they shall put it and all its utensils in a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put it on the carrying bars. -- numbers 4:10
.
"Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall insert its poles; -- numbers 4:11
.
and they shall take all the utensils of service, with which they serve in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin, and put them on the carrying bars. -- numbers 4:12
.
"Then they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it. -- numbers 4:13
.
"They shall also put on it all its utensils by which they serve in connection with it: the firepans, the forks and shovels and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread a cover of porpoise skin over it and insert its poles. -- numbers 4:14
.
"When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die. These are the things in the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry. -- numbers 4:15
.
"The responsibility of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light and the fragrant incense and the continual grain offering and the anointing oil--the responsibility of all the tabernacle and of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings." -- numbers 4:16
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, -- numbers 4:17
.
"Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites. -- numbers 4:18
.
"But do this to them that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy objects: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each of them to his work and to his load; -- numbers 4:19
.
but they shall not go in to see the holy objects even for a moment, or they will die." -- numbers 4:20
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 4:21
.
"Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' households, by their families; -- numbers 4:22
.
from thirty years and upward to fifty years old, you shall number them; all who enter to perform the service to do the work in the tent of meeting. -- numbers 4:23
.
"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying: -- numbers 4:24
.
they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering and the covering of porpoise skin that is on top of it, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting, -- numbers 4:25
.
and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the gate of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords and all the equipment for their service; and all that is to be done, they shall perform. -- numbers 4:26
.
"All the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their loads and in all their work, shall be performed at the command of Aaron and his sons; and you shall assign to them as a duty all their loads. -- numbers 4:27
.
"This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. -- numbers 4:28
.
"As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families, by their fathers' households; -- numbers 4:29
.
from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, you shall number them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tent of meeting. -- numbers 4:30
.
"Now this is the duty of their loads, for all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle and its bars and its pillars and its sockets, -- numbers 4:31
.
and the pillars around the court and their sockets and their pegs and their cords, with all their equipment and with all their service; and you shall assign each man by name the items he is to carry. -- numbers 4:32
.
"This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest." -- numbers 4:33
.
So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers' households, -- numbers 4:34
.
from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting. -- numbers 4:35
.
Their numbered men by their families were 2,750. -- numbers 4:36
.
These are the numbered men of the Kohathite families, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses. -- numbers 4:37
.
The numbered men of the sons of Gershon by their families and by their fathers' households, -- numbers 4:38
.
from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting. -- numbers 4:39
.
Their numbered men by their families, by their fathers' households, were 2,630. -- numbers 4:40
.
These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD. -- numbers 4:41
.
The numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari by their families, by their fathers' households, -- numbers 4:42
.
from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting. -- numbers 4:43
.
Their numbered men by their families were 3,200. -- numbers 4:44
.
These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses. -- numbers 4:45
.
All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers' households, -- numbers 4:46
.
from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the tent of meeting. -- numbers 4:47
.
Their numbered men were 8,580. -- numbers 4:48
.
According to the commandment of the LORD through Moses, they were numbered, everyone by his serving or carrying; thus these were his numbered men, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 4:49
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 5:1
.
"Command the sons of Israel that they send away from the camp every leper and everyone having a discharge and everyone who is unclean because of a dead person. -- numbers 5:2
.
"You shall send away both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp so that they will not defile their camp where I dwell in their midst." -- numbers 5:3
.
The sons of Israel did so and sent them outside the camp; just as the LORD had spoken to Moses, thus the sons of Israel did. -- numbers 5:4
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 5:5
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, 'When a man or woman commits any of the sins of mankind, acting unfaithfully against the LORD, and that person is guilty, -- numbers 5:6
.
then he shall confess his sins which he has committed, and he shall make restitution in full for his wrong and add to it one-fifth of it, and give it to him whom he has wronged. -- numbers 5:7
.
'But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made for the wrong must go to the LORD for the priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which atonement is made for him. -- numbers 5:8
.
'Also every contribution pertaining to all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they offer to the priest, shall be his. -- numbers 5:9
.
'So every man's holy gifts shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest, it becomes his.'" -- numbers 5:10
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 5:11
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'If any man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him, -- numbers 5:12
.
and a man has intercourse with her and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is undetected, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act, -- numbers 5:13
.
if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has defiled herself, or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has not defiled herself, -- numbers 5:14
.
the man shall then bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring as an offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of memorial, a reminder of iniquity. -- numbers 5:15
.
'Then the priest shall bring her near and have her stand before the LORD, -- numbers 5:16
.
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel; and he shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water. -- numbers 5:17
.
'The priest shall then have the woman stand before the LORD and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and place the grain offering of memorial in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest is to be the water of bitterness that brings a curse. -- numbers 5:18
.
'The priest shall have her take an oath and shall say to the woman, "If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray into uncleanness, being under the authority of your husband, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings a curse; -- numbers 5:19
.
if you, however, have gone astray, being under the authority of your husband, and if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has had intercourse with you" -- numbers 5:20
.
(then the priest shall have the woman swear with the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman), "the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people by the LORD'S making your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell; -- numbers 5:21
.
and this water that brings a curse shall go into your stomach, and make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away." And the woman shall say, "Amen. Amen." -- numbers 5:22
.
'The priest shall then write these curses on a scroll, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness. -- numbers 5:23
.
'Then he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, so that the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness. -- numbers 5:24
.
'The priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar; -- numbers 5:25
.
and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water. -- numbers 5:26
.
'When he has made her drink the water, then it shall come about, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, that the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness, and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people. -- numbers 5:27
.
'But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will then be free and conceive children. -- numbers 5:28
.
'This is the law of jealousy: when a wife, being under the authority of her husband, goes astray and defiles herself, -- numbers 5:29
.
or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he shall then make the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest shall apply all this law to her. -- numbers 5:30
.
'Moreover, the man will be free from guilt, but that woman shall bear her guilt.'" -- numbers 5:31
.
Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 6:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to dedicate himself to the LORD, -- numbers 6:2
.
he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes. -- numbers 6:3
.
'All the days of his separation he shall not eat anything that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skin. -- numbers 6:4
.
'All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to the LORD; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long. -- numbers 6:5
.
'All the days of his separation to the LORD he shall not go near to a dead person. -- numbers 6:6
.
'He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is on his head. -- numbers 6:7
.
'All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD. -- numbers 6:8
.
'But if a man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his dedicated head of hair, then he shall shave his head on the day when he becomes clean; he shall shave it on the seventh day. -- numbers 6:9
.
'Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- numbers 6:10
.
'The priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the dead person. And that same day he shall consecrate his head, -- numbers 6:11
.
and shall dedicate to the LORD his days as a Nazirite, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering; but the former days will be void because his separation was defiled. -- numbers 6:12
.
'Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall bring the offering to the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- numbers 6:13
.
'He shall present his offering to the LORD: one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering and one ewe-lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering and one ram without defect for a peace offering, -- numbers 6:14
.
and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their drink offering. -- numbers 6:15
.
'Then the priest shall present them before the LORD and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering. -- numbers 6:16
.
'He shall also offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall likewise offer its grain offering and its drink offering. -- numbers 6:17
.
'The Nazirite shall then shave his dedicated head of hair at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and take the dedicated hair of his head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings. -- numbers 6:18
.
'The priest shall take the ram's shoulder when it has been boiled, and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his dedicated hair. -- numbers 6:19
.
'Then the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.' -- numbers 6:20
.
"This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD according to his separation, in addition to what else he can afford; according to his vow which he takes, so he shall do according to the law of his separation." -- numbers 6:21
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 6:22
.
"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them: -- numbers 6:23
.
The LORD bless you, and keep you; -- numbers 6:24
.
The LORD make His face shine on you, And be gracious to you; -- numbers 6:25
.
The LORD lift up His countenance on you, And give you peace.' -- numbers 6:26
.
"So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I then will bless them." -- numbers 6:27
.
Now on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it with all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and consecrated them also. -- numbers 7:1
.
Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' households, made an offering (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who were over the numbered men). -- numbers 7:2
.
When they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders and an ox for each one, then they presented them before the tabernacle. -- numbers 7:3
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 7:4
.
"Accept these things from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service." -- numbers 7:5
.
So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites. -- numbers 7:6
.
Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service, -- numbers 7:7
.
and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. -- numbers 7:8
.
But he did not give any to the sons of Kohath because theirs was the service of the holy objects, which they carried on the shoulder. -- numbers 7:9
.
The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed, so the leaders offered their offering before the altar. -- numbers 7:10
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Let them present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar." -- numbers 7:11
.
Now the one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah; -- numbers 7:12
.
and his offering was one silver dish whose weight was one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; -- numbers 7:13

Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold; from its base to its flowers it was hammered work; according to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand. -- numbers 8:4
.
Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 8:5
.
"Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them. -- numbers 8:6
.
"Thus you shall do to them, for their cleansing: sprinkle purifying water on them, and let them use a razor over their whole body and wash their clothes, and they will be clean. -- numbers 8:7
.
"Then let them take a bull with its grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and a second bull you shall take for a sin offering. -- numbers 8:8
.
"So you shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting. You shall also assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, -- numbers 8:9
.
and present the Levites before the LORD; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites. -- numbers 8:10
.
"Aaron then shall present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, that they may qualify to perform the service of the LORD. -- numbers 8:11
.
"Now the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; then offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites. -- numbers 8:12
.
"You shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and before his sons so as to present them as a wave offering to the LORD. -- numbers 8:13
.
"Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine. -- numbers 8:14
.
"Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the tent of meeting. But you shall cleanse them and present them as a wave offering; -- numbers 8:15
.
for they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself instead of every first issue of the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel. -- numbers 8:16
.
"For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, among the men and among the animals; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself. -- numbers 8:17
.
"But I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel. -- numbers 8:18
.
"I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on behalf of the sons of Israel, so that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel by their coming near to the sanctuary." -- numbers 8:19
.
Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel to the Levites; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them. -- numbers 8:20
.
The Levites, too, purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them. -- numbers 8:21
.
Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons; just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them. -- numbers 8:22
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 8:23
.
"This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the tent of meeting. -- numbers 8:24
.
"But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from service in the work and not work any more. -- numbers 8:25
.
"They may, however, assist their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep an obligation, but they themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning their obligations." -- numbers 8:26
.
Thus the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, -- numbers 9:1
.
"Now, let the sons of Israel observe the Passover at its appointed time. -- numbers 9:2
.
"On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall observe it at its appointed time; you shall observe it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances." -- numbers 9:3
.
So Moses told the sons of Israel to observe the Passover. -- numbers 9:4
.
They observed the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did. -- numbers 9:5
.
But there were some men who were unclean because of the dead person, so that they could not observe Passover on that day; so they came before Moses and Aaron on that day. -- numbers 9:6
.
Those men said to him, "Though we are unclean because of the dead person, why are we restrained from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the sons of Israel?" -- numbers 9:7
.
Moses therefore said to them, "Wait, and I will listen to what the LORD will command concerning you." -- numbers 9:8
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 9:9
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If any one of you or of your generations becomes unclean because of a dead person, or is on a distant journey, he may, however, observe the Passover to the LORD. -- numbers 9:10
.
'In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight, they shall observe it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. -- numbers 9:11
.
'They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute of the Passover they shall observe it. -- numbers 9:12
.
'But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and yet neglects to observe the Passover, that person shall then be cut off from his people, for he did not present the offering of the LORD at its appointed time. That man will bear his sin. -- numbers 9:13
.
'If an alien sojourns among you and observes the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance, so he shall do; you shall have one statute, both for the alien and for the native of the land.'" -- numbers 9:14
.
Now on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle, until morning. -- numbers 9:15
.
So it was continuously; the cloud would cover it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. -- numbers 9:16
.
Whenever the cloud was lifted from over the tent, afterward the sons of Israel would then set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the sons of Israel would camp. -- numbers 9:17
.
At the command of the LORD the sons of Israel would set out, and at the command of the LORD they would camp; as long as the cloud settled over the tabernacle, they remained camped. -- numbers 9:18
.
Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the sons of Israel would keep the LORD'S charge and not set out. -- numbers 9:19
.
If sometimes the cloud remained a few days over the tabernacle, according to the command of the LORD they remained camped. Then according to the command of the LORD they set out. -- numbers 9:20
.
If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was lifted in the morning, they would move out; or if it remained in the daytime and at night, whenever the cloud was lifted, they would set out. -- numbers 9:21
.
Whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud lingered over the tabernacle, staying above it, the sons of Israel remained camped and did not set out; but when it was lifted, they did set out. -- numbers 9:22
.
At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out; they kept the LORD'S charge, according to the command of the LORD through Moses. -- numbers 9:23
.
The LORD spoke further to Moses, saying, -- numbers 10:1
.
"Make yourself two trumpets of silver, of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out. -- numbers 10:2
.
"When both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- numbers 10:3
.
"Yet if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall assemble before you. -- numbers 10:4
.
"But when you blow an alarm, the camps that are pitched on the east side shall set out. -- numbers 10:5
.
"When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are pitched on the south side shall set out; an alarm is to be blown for them to set out. -- numbers 10:6
.
"When convening the assembly, however, you shall blow without sounding an alarm. -- numbers 10:7
.
"The priestly sons of Aaron, moreover, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations. -- numbers 10:8
.
"When you go to war in your land against the adversary who attacks you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and be saved from your enemies. -- numbers 10:9
.
"Also in the day of your gladness and in your appointed feasts, and on the first days of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be as a reminder of you before your God. I am the LORD your God." -- numbers 10:10
.
Now in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, the cloud was lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony; -- numbers 10:11
.
and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran. -- numbers 10:12
.
So they moved out for the first time according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses. -- numbers 10:13
.
The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah, according to their armies, set out first, with Nahshon the son of Amminadab, over its army, -- numbers 10:14
.
and Nethanel the son of Zuar, over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar; -- numbers 10:15
.
and Eliab the son of Helon over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun. -- numbers 10:16
.
Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were carrying the tabernacle, set out. -- numbers 10:17
.
Next the standard of the camp of Reuben, according to their armies, set out with Elizur the son of Shedeur, over its army, -- numbers 10:18
.
and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon, -- numbers 10:19
.
and Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the tribal army of the sons of Gad. -- numbers 10:20
.
Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival. -- numbers 10:21
.
Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim, according to their armies, was set out, with Elishama the son of Ammihud over its army, -- numbers 10:22
.
and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh; -- numbers 10:23
.
and Abidan the son of Gideoni over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin. -- numbers 10:24
.
Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, according to their armies, which formed the rear guard for all the camps, set out, with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai over its army, -- numbers 10:25
.
and Pagiel the son of Ochran over the tribal army of the sons of Asher; -- numbers 10:26
.
and Ahira the son of Enan over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali. -- numbers 10:27
.
This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out. -- numbers 10:28
.
Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out to the place of which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you'; come with us and we will do you good, for the LORD has promised good concerning Israel." -- numbers 10:29
.
But he said to him, "I will not come, but rather will go to my own land and relatives." -- numbers 10:30
.
Then he said, "Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will be as eyes for us. -- numbers 10:31
.
"So it will be, if you go with us, that whatever good the LORD does for us, we will do for you." -- numbers 10:32
.
Thus they set out from the mount of the LORD three days' journey, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD journeying in front of them for the three days, to seek out a resting place for them. -- numbers 10:33
.
The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp. -- numbers 10:34
.
Then it came about when the ark set out that Moses said, "Rise up, O LORD! And let Your enemies be scattered, And let those who hate You flee before You." -- numbers 10:35
.
When it came to rest, he said, "Return, O LORD, To the myriad thousands of Israel." -- numbers 10:36
.
Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of the LORD; and when the LORD heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. -- numbers 11:1
.
The people therefore cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD and the fire died out. -- numbers 11:2
.
So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them. -- numbers 11:3
.
The rabble who were among them had greedy desires; and also the sons of Israel wept again and said, "Who will give us meat to eat? -- numbers 11:4
.
"We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic, -- numbers 11:5
.
but now our appetite is gone. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna." -- numbers 11:6
.
Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium. -- numbers 11:7
.
The people would go about and gather it and grind it between two millstones or beat it in the mortar, and boil it in the pot and make cakes with it; and its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil. -- numbers 11:8
.
When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it. -- numbers 11:9
.
Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each man at the doorway of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased. -- numbers 11:10
.
So Moses said to the LORD, "Why have You been so hard on Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all this people on me? -- numbers 11:11
.
"Was it I who conceived all this people? Was it I who brought them forth, that You should say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which You swore to their fathers'? -- numbers 11:12
.
"Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, 'Give us meat that we may eat!' -- numbers 11:13
.
"I alone am not able to carry all this people, because it is too burdensome for me. -- numbers 11:14
.
"So if You are going to deal thus with me, please kill me at once, if I have found favor in Your sight, and do not let me see my wretchedness." -- numbers 11:15
.
The LORD therefore said to Moses, "Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you. -- numbers 11:16
.
"Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not bear it all alone. -- numbers 11:17
.
"Say to the people, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, "Oh that someone would give us meat to eat! For we were well-off in Egypt." Therefore the LORD will give you meat and you shall eat. -- numbers 11:18
.
'You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, -- numbers 11:19
.
but a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you; because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'" -- numbers 11:20
.
But Moses said, "The people, among whom I am, are 600,on foot; yet You have said, 'I will give them meat, so that they may eat for a whole month.' -- numbers 11:21
.
"Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?" -- numbers 11:22
.
The LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD'S power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not." -- numbers 11:23
.
So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. Also, he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stationed them around the tent. -- numbers 11:24
.
Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do it again. -- numbers 11:25
.
But two men had remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them (now they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the tent), and they prophesied in the camp. -- numbers 11:26
.
So a young man ran and told Moses and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp." -- numbers 11:27
.
Then Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses from his youth, said, "Moses, my lord, restrain them." -- numbers 11:28
.
But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD'S people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!" -- numbers 11:29
.
Then Moses returned to the camp, both he and the elders of Israel. -- numbers 11:30
.
Now there went forth a wind from the LORD and it brought quail from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp and about two cubits deep on the surface of the ground. -- numbers 11:31
.
The people spent all day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers) and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. -- numbers 11:32
.
While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very severe plague. -- numbers 11:33
.
So the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had been greedy. -- numbers 11:34
.
From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth. -- numbers 11:35
.
Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman); -- numbers 12:1
.
and they said, "Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?" And the LORD heard it. -- numbers 12:2
.
(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.) -- numbers 12:3
.
Suddenly the LORD said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam, "You three come out to the tent of meeting." So the three of them came out. -- numbers 12:4
.
Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and He called Aaron and Miriam. When they had both come forward, -- numbers 12:5
.
He said, "Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream. -- numbers 12:6
.
"Not so, with My servant Moses, He is faithful in all My household; -- numbers 12:7
.
With him I speak mouth to mouth, Even openly, and not in dark sayings, And he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant, against Moses?" -- numbers 12:8
.
So the anger of the LORD burned against them and He departed. -- numbers 12:9
.
But when the cloud had withdrawn from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. As Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, she was leprous. -- numbers 12:10
.
Then Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not account this sin to us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned. -- numbers 12:11
.
"Oh, do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes from his mother's womb!" -- numbers 12:12
.
Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "O God, heal her, I pray!" -- numbers 12:13
.
But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be received again." -- numbers 12:14
.
So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was received again. -- numbers 12:15
.
Afterward, however, the people moved out from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran. -- numbers 12:16
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses saying, -- numbers 13:1
.
"Send out for yourself men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers' tribes, every one a leader among them." -- numbers 13:2
.
So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel. -- numbers 13:3
.
These then were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur; -- numbers 13:4
.
from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; -- numbers 13:5
.
from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; -- numbers 13:6
.
from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; -- numbers 13:7
.
from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; -- numbers 13:8
.
from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; -- numbers 13:9
.
from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; -- numbers 13:10
.
from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi; -- numbers 13:11
.
from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; -- numbers 13:12
.
from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; -- numbers 13:13
.
from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; -- numbers 13:14
.
from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. -- numbers 13:15
.
These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua. -- numbers 13:16
.
When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, "Go up there into the Negev; then go up into the hill country. -- numbers 13:17
.
"See what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many. -- numbers 13:18
.
"How is the land in which they live, is it good or bad? And how are the cities in which they live, are they like open camps or with fortifications? -- numbers 13:19
.
"How is the land, is it fat or lean? Are there trees in it or not? Make an effort then to get some of the fruit of the land." Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes. -- numbers 13:20
.
So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath. -- numbers 13:21
.
When they had gone up into the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) -- numbers 13:22
.
Then they came to the valley of Eshcol and from there cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two men, with some of the pomegranates and the figs. -- numbers 13:23
.
That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there. -- numbers 13:24
.
When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days, -- numbers 13:25
.
they proceeded to come to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. -- numbers 13:26
.
Thus they told him, and said, "We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. -- numbers 13:27
.
"Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there. -- numbers 13:28
.
"Amalek is living in the land of the Negev and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country, and the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan." -- numbers 13:29
.
Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "We should by all means go up and take possession of it, for we will surely overcome it." -- numbers 13:30
.
But the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us." -- numbers 13:31
.
So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, "The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size. -- numbers 13:32
.
"There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight." -- numbers 13:33
.
Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night. -- numbers 14:1
.
All the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness! -- numbers 14:2
.
"Why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?" -- numbers 14:3
.
So they said to one another, "Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt." -- numbers 14:4
.
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel. -- numbers 14:5
.
Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes; -- numbers 14:6
.
and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land. -- numbers 14:7
.
"If the LORD is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us--a land which flows with milk and honey. -- numbers 14:8
.
"Only do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our prey. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them." -- numbers 14:9
.
But all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel. -- numbers 14:10
.
The LORD said to Moses, "How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst? -- numbers 14:11
.
"I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they." -- numbers 14:12
.
But Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought up this people from their midst, -- numbers 14:13
.
and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people, for You, O LORD, are seen eye to eye, while Your cloud stands over them; and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night. -- numbers 14:14
.
"Now if You slay this people as one man, then the nations who have heard of Your fame will say, -- numbers 14:15
.
'Because the LORD could not bring this people into the land which He promised them by oath, therefore He slaughtered them in the wilderness.' -- numbers 14:16
.
"But now, I pray, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have declared, -- numbers 14:17
.
'The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generations.' -- numbers 14:18
.
"Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now." -- numbers 14:19
.
So the LORD said, "I have pardoned them according to your word; -- numbers 14:20
.
but indeed, as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD. -- numbers 14:21
.
"Surely all the men who have seen My glory and My signs which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to the test these ten times and have not listened to My voice, -- numbers 14:22
.
shall by no means see the land which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who spurned Me see it. -- numbers 14:23
.
"But My servant Caleb, because he has had a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land which he entered, and his descendants shall take possession of it. -- numbers 14:24
.
"Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; turn tomorrow and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea." -- numbers 14:25
.
The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, -- numbers 14:26
.
"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who are grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they are making against Me. -- numbers 14:27
.
"Say to them, 'As I live,' says the LORD, 'just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will surely do to you; -- numbers 14:28
.
your corpses will fall in this wilderness, even all your numbered men, according to your complete number from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against Me. -- numbers 14:29
.
'Surely you shall not come into the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun. -- numbers 14:30
.
'Your children, however, whom you said would become a prey--I will bring them in, and they will know the land which you have rejected. -- numbers 14:31
.
'But as for you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness. -- numbers 14:32
.
'Your sons shall be shepherds for forty years in the wilderness, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness, until your corpses lie in the wilderness. -- numbers 14:33
.
'According to the number of days which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day you shall bear your guilt a year, even forty years, and you will know My opposition. -- numbers 14:34
.
'I, the LORD, have spoken, surely this I will do to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be destroyed, and there they will die.'" -- numbers 14:35
.
As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report concerning the land, -- numbers 14:36
.
even those men who brought out the very bad report of the land died by a plague before the LORD. -- numbers 14:37
.
But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land. -- numbers 14:38
.
When Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people mourned greatly. -- numbers 14:39
.
In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, "Here we are; we have indeed sinned, but we will go up to the place which the LORD has promised." -- numbers 14:40
.
But Moses said, "Why then are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD, when it will not succeed? -- numbers 14:41
.
"Do not go up, or you will be struck down before your enemies, for the LORD is not among you. -- numbers 14:42
.
"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword, inasmuch as you have turned back from following the LORD. And the LORD will not be with you." -- numbers 14:43
.
But they went up heedlessly to the ridge of the hill country; neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses left the camp. -- numbers 14:44
.
Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down, and struck them and beat them down as far as Hormah. -- numbers 14:45
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 15:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land where you are to live, which I am giving you, -- numbers 15:2
.
then make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma to the LORD, from the herd or from the flock. -- numbers 15:3
.
'The one who presents his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil, -- numbers 15:4
.
and you shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one-fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. -- numbers 15:5
.
'Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil; -- numbers 15:6
.
and for the drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- numbers 15:7
.
'When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a special vow, or for peace offerings to the LORD, -- numbers 15:8
.
then you shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-half a hin of oil; -- numbers 15:9
.
and you shall offer as the drink offering one-half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- numbers 15:10
.
'Thus it shall be done for each ox, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the goats. -- numbers 15:11
.
'According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for everyone according to their number. -- numbers 15:12
.
'All who are native shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- numbers 15:13
.
'If an alien sojourns with you, or one who may be among you throughout your generations, and he wishes to make an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, just as you do so he shall do. -- numbers 15:14
.
'As for the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the alien who sojourns with you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the alien be before the LORD. -- numbers 15:15
.
'There is to be one law and one ordinance for you and for the alien who sojourns with you.'" -- numbers 15:16
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 15:17
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land where I bring you, -- numbers 15:18
.
then it shall be, that when you eat of the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering to the LORD. -- numbers 15:19
.
'Of the first of your dough you shall lift up a cake as an offering; as the offering of the threshing floor, so you shall lift it up. -- numbers 15:20
.
'From the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an offering throughout your generations. -- numbers 15:21
.
'But when you unwittingly fail and do not observe all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses, -- numbers 15:22
.
even all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day when the LORD gave commandment and onward throughout your generations, -- numbers 15:23
.
then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one bull for a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering. -- numbers 15:24
.
'Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they will be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error. -- numbers 15:25
.
'So all the congregation of the sons of Israel will be forgiven, with the alien who sojourns among them, for it happened to all the people through error. -- numbers 15:26
.
'Also if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall offer a one year old female goat for a sin offering. -- numbers 15:27
.
'The priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him that he may be forgiven. -- numbers 15:28
.
'You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the sons of Israel and for the alien who sojourns among them. -- numbers 15:29
.
'But the person who does anything defiantly, whether he is native or an alien, that one is blaspheming the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from among his people. -- numbers 15:30
.
'Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt will be on him.'" -- numbers 15:31
.
Now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the sabbath day. -- numbers 15:32
.
Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation; -- numbers 15:33
.
and they put him in custody because it had not been declared what should be done to him. -- numbers 15:34
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp." -- numbers 15:35
.
So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 15:36
.
The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 15:37
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put on the tassel of each corner a cord of blue. -- numbers 15:38
.
"It shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, so as to do them and not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you played the harlot, -- numbers 15:39
.
so that you may remember to do all My commandments and be holy to your God. -- numbers 15:40
.
"I am the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD your God." -- numbers 15:41
.
Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took action, -- numbers 16:1
.
and they rose up before Moses, together with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen in the assembly, men of renown. -- numbers 16:2
.
They assembled together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "You have gone far enough, for all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is in their midst; so why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?" -- numbers 16:3
.
When Moses heard this, he fell on his face; -- numbers 16:4
.
and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, "Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who is His, and who is holy, and will bring him near to Himself; even the one whom He will choose, He will bring near to Himself. -- numbers 16:5
.
"Do this: take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your company, -- numbers 16:6
.
and put fire in them, and lay incense upon them in the presence of the LORD tomorrow; and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the one who is holy. You have gone far enough, you sons of Levi!" -- numbers 16:7
.
Then Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi, -- numbers 16:8
.
is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them; -- numbers 16:9
.
and that He has brought you near, Korah, and all your brothers, sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking for the priesthood also? -- numbers 16:10
.
"Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD; but as for Aaron, who is he that you grumble against him?" -- numbers 16:11
.
Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, "We will not come up. -- numbers 16:12
.
"Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, but you would also lord it over us? -- numbers 16:13
.
"Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!" -- numbers 16:14
.
Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not regard their offering! I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them." -- numbers 16:15
.
Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company be present before the LORD tomorrow, both you and they along with Aaron. -- numbers 16:16
.
"Each of you take his firepan and put incense on it, and each of you bring his censer before the LORD, two hundred and fifty firepans; also you and Aaron shall each bring his firepan." -- numbers 16:17
.
So they each took his own censer and put fire on it, and laid incense on it; and they stood at the doorway of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron. -- numbers 16:18
.
Thus Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the doorway of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation. -- numbers 16:19
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, -- numbers 16:20
.
"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly." -- numbers 16:21
.
But they fell on their faces and said, "O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the entire congregation?" -- numbers 16:22
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 16:23
.
"Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'" -- numbers 16:24
.
Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of Israel following him, -- numbers 16:25
.
and he spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, or you will be swept away in all their sin." -- numbers 16:26
.
So they got back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the doorway of their tents, along with their wives and their sons and their little ones. -- numbers 16:27
.
Moses said, "By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these deeds; for this is not my doing. -- numbers 16:28
.
"If these men die the death of all men or if they suffer the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me. -- numbers 16:29
.
"But if the LORD brings about an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they descend alive into Sheol, then you will understand that these men have spurned the LORD." -- numbers 16:30
.
As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open; -- numbers 16:31
.
and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who belonged to Korah with their possessions. -- numbers 16:32
.
So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly. -- numbers 16:33
.
All Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, "The earth may swallow us up!" -- numbers 16:34
.
Fire also came forth from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense. -- numbers 16:35
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 16:36
.
"Say to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he shall take up the censers out of the midst of the blaze, for they are holy; and you scatter the burning coals abroad. -- numbers 16:37
.
"As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered sheets for a plating of the altar, since they did present them before the LORD and they are holy; and they shall be for a sign to the sons of Israel." -- numbers 16:38
.
So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the men who were burned had offered, and they hammered them out as a plating for the altar, -- numbers 16:39
.
as a reminder to the sons of Israel that no layman who is not of the descendants of Aaron should come near to burn incense before the LORD; so that he will not become like Korah and his company--just as the LORD had spoken to him through Moses. -- numbers 16:40
.
But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You are the ones who have caused the death of the LORD'S people." -- numbers 16:41
.
It came about, however, when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared. -- numbers 16:42
.
Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting, -- numbers 16:43
.
and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 16:44
.
"Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly." Then they fell on their faces. -- numbers 16:45
.
Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put in it fire from the altar, and lay incense on it; then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone forth from the LORD, the plague has begun!" -- numbers 16:46
.
Then Aaron took it as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people. -- numbers 16:47
.
He took his stand between the dead and the living, so that the plague was checked. -- numbers 16:48
.
But those who died by the plague were 14,700, besides those who died on account of Korah. -- numbers 16:49
.
Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been checked. -- numbers 16:50
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 17:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, and get from them a rod for each father's household: twelve rods, from all their leaders according to their fathers' households. You shall write each name on his rod, -- numbers 17:2
.
and write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers' households. -- numbers 17:3
.
"You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you. -- numbers 17:4
.
"It will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I will lessen from upon Myself the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you." -- numbers 17:5
.
Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers' households, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods. -- numbers 17:6
.
So Moses deposited the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony. -- numbers 17:7
.
Now on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds. -- numbers 17:8
.
Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the LORD to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod. -- numbers 17:9
.
But the LORD said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, so that they will not die." -- numbers 17:10
.
Thus Moses did; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did. -- numbers 17:11
.
Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish, we are dying, we are all dying! -- numbers 17:12
.
"Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?" -- numbers 17:13
.
So the LORD said to Aaron, "You and your sons and your father's household with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt in connection with your priesthood. -- numbers 18:1
.
"But bring with you also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you, while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony. -- numbers 18:2
.
"And they shall thus attend to your obligation and the obligation of all the tent, but they shall not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar, or both they and you will die. -- numbers 18:3
.
"They shall be joined with you and attend to the obligations of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but an outsider may not come near you. -- numbers 18:4
.
"So you shall attend to the obligations of the sanctuary and the obligations of the altar, so that there will no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel. -- numbers 18:5
.
"Behold, I Myself have taken your fellow Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD, to perform the service for the tent of meeting. -- numbers 18:6
.
"But you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and inside the veil, and you are to perform service. I am giving you the priesthood as a bestowed service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death." -- numbers 18:7
.
Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, "Now behold, I Myself have given you charge of My offerings, even all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual allotment. -- numbers 18:8
.
"This shall be yours from the most holy gifts reserved from the fire; every offering of theirs, even every grain offering and every sin offering and every guilt offering, which they shall render to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. -- numbers 18:9
.
"As the most holy gifts you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you. -- numbers 18:10
.
"This also is yours, the offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual allotment. Everyone of your household who is clean may eat it. -- numbers 18:11
.
"All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the fresh wine and of the grain, the first fruits of those which they give to the LORD, I give them to you. -- numbers 18:12
.
"The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone of your household who is clean may eat it. -- numbers 18:13
.
"Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours. -- numbers 18:14
.
"Every first issue of the womb of all flesh, whether man or animal, which they offer to the LORD, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem. -- numbers 18:15
.
"As to their redemption price, from a month old you shall redeem them, by your valuation, five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. -- numbers 18:16
.
"But the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall offer up their fat in smoke as an offering by fire, for a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- numbers 18:17
.
"Their meat shall be yours; it shall be yours like the breast of a wave offering and like the right thigh. -- numbers 18:18
.
"All the offerings of the holy gifts, which the sons of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual allotment. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD to you and your descendants with you." -- numbers 18:19
.
Then the LORD said to Aaron, "You shall have no inheritance in their land nor own any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel. -- numbers 18:20
.
"To the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting. -- numbers 18:21
.
"The sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die. -- numbers 18:22
.
"Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance. -- numbers 18:23
.
"For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning them, 'They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.'" -- numbers 18:24
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 18:25
.
"Moreover, you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present an offering from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe. -- numbers 18:26
.
'Your offering shall be reckoned to you as the grain from the threshing floor or the full produce from the wine vat. -- numbers 18:27
.
'So you shall also present an offering to the LORD from your tithes, which you receive from the sons of Israel; and from it you shall give the LORD'S offering to Aaron the priest. -- numbers 18:28
.
'Out of all your gifts you shall present every offering due to the LORD, from all the best of them, the sacred part from them.' -- numbers 18:29
.
"You shall say to them, 'When you have offered from it the best of it, then the rest shall be reckoned to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor, and as the product of the wine vat. -- numbers 18:30
.
'You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your compensation in return for your service in the tent of meeting. -- numbers 18:31
.
'You will bear no sin by reason of it when you have offered the best of it. But you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the sons of Israel, or you will die.'" -- numbers 18:32
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, -- numbers 19:1
.
"This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, 'Speak to the sons of Israel that they bring you an unblemished red heifer in which is no defect and on which a yoke has never been placed. -- numbers 19:2
.
'You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be brought outside the camp and be slaughtered in his presence. -- numbers 19:3
.
'Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. -- numbers 19:4
.
'Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned. -- numbers 19:5
.
'The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet material and cast it into the midst of the burning heifer. -- numbers 19:6
.
'The priest shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward come into the camp, but the priest shall be unclean until evening. -- numbers 19:7
.
'The one who burns it shall also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening. -- numbers 19:8
.
'Now a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the congregation of the sons of Israel shall keep it as water to remove impurity; it is purification from sin. -- numbers 19:9
.
'The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; and it shall be a perpetual statute to the sons of Israel and to the alien who sojourns among them. -- numbers 19:10
.
'The one who touches the corpse of any person shall be unclean for seven days. -- numbers 19:11
.
'That one shall purify himself from uncleanness with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and then he will be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean. -- numbers 19:12
.
'Anyone who touches a corpse, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him. -- numbers 19:13
.
'This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days. -- numbers 19:14
.
'Every open vessel, which has no covering tied down on it, shall be unclean. -- numbers 19:15
.
'Also, anyone who in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or who has died naturally, or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days. -- numbers 19:16
.
'Then for the unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt purification from sin and flowing water shall be added to them in a vessel. -- numbers 19:17
.
'A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there, and on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one dying naturally or the grave. -- numbers 19:18
.
'Then the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him from uncleanness, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean by evening. -- numbers 19:19
.
'But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself from uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean. -- numbers 19:20
.
'So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening. -- numbers 19:21
.
'Furthermore, anything that the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.'" -- numbers 19:22
.
Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people stayed at Kadesh. Now Miriam died there and was buried there. -- numbers 20:1
.
There was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron. -- numbers 20:2
.
The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, "If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD! -- numbers 20:3
.
"Why then have you brought the LORD'S assembly into this wilderness, for us and our beasts to die here? -- numbers 20:4
.
"Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us in to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink." -- numbers 20:5
.
Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to them; -- numbers 20:6
.
and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 20:7
.
"Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink." -- numbers 20:8
.
So Moses took the rod from before the LORD, just as He had commanded him; -- numbers 20:9
.
and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, "Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?" -- numbers 20:10
.
Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank. -- numbers 20:11
.
But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you have not believed Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them." -- numbers 20:12
.
Those were the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and He proved Himself holy among them. -- numbers 20:13
.
From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom: "Thus your brother Israel has said, 'You know all the hardship that has befallen us; -- numbers 20:14
.
that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly. -- numbers 20:15
.
'But when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory. -- numbers 20:16
.
'Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the king's highway, not turning to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.'" -- numbers 20:17
.
Edom, however, said to him, "You shall not pass through us, or I will come out with the sword against you." -- numbers 20:18
.
Again, the sons of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing else." -- numbers 20:19
.
But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against him with a heavy force and with a strong hand. -- numbers 20:20
.
Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him. -- numbers 20:21
.
Now when they set out from Kadesh, the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. -- numbers 20:22
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying, -- numbers 20:23
.
"Aaron will be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah. -- numbers 20:24
.
"Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up to Mount Hor; -- numbers 20:25
.
and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron will be gathered to his people, and will die there." -- numbers 20:26
.
So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. -- numbers 20:27
.
After Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. -- numbers 20:28
.
When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days. -- numbers 20:29
.
When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, then he fought against Israel and took some of them captive. -- numbers 21:1
.
So Israel made a vow to the LORD and said, "If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities." -- numbers 21:2
.
The LORD heard the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites; then they utterly destroyed them and their cities. Thus the name of the place was called Hormah. -- numbers 21:3
.
Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient because of the journey. -- numbers 21:4
.
The people spoke against God and Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this miserable food." -- numbers 21:5
.
The LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. -- numbers 21:6
.
So the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD and you; intercede with the LORD, that He may remove the serpents from us." And Moses interceded for the people. -- numbers 21:7
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, he will live." -- numbers 21:8
.
And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard; and it came about, that if a serpent bit any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived. -- numbers 21:9
.
Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped in Oboth. -- numbers 21:10
.
They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, to the east. -- numbers 21:11
.
From there they set out and camped in Wadi Zered. -- numbers 21:12
.
From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. -- numbers 21:13
.
Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, "Waheb in Suphah, And the wadis of the Arnon, -- numbers 21:14
.
And the slope of the wadis That extends to the site of Ar, And leans to the border of Moab." -- numbers 21:15
.
From there they continued to Beer, that is the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Assemble the people, that I may give them water." -- numbers 21:16
.
Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well! Sing to it! -- numbers 21:17
.
"The well, which the leaders sank, Which the nobles of the people dug, With the scepter and with their staffs." And from the wilderness they continued to Mattanah, -- numbers 21:18
.
and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, -- numbers 21:19
.
and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah which overlooks the wasteland. -- numbers 21:20
.
Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying, -- numbers 21:21
.
"Let me pass through your land. We will not turn off into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king's highway until we have passed through your border." -- numbers 21:22
.
But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border. So Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. -- numbers 21:23
.
Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon was Jazer. -- numbers 21:24
.
Israel took all these cities and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her villages. -- numbers 21:25
.
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. -- numbers 21:26
.
Therefore those who use proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon! Let it be built! So let the city of Sihon be established. -- numbers 21:27
.
"For a fire went forth from Heshbon, A flame from the town of Sihon; It devoured Ar of Moab, The dominant heights of the Arnon. -- numbers 21:28
.
"Woe to you, O Moab! You are ruined, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To an Amorite king, Sihon. -- numbers 21:29
.
"But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba." -- numbers 21:30
.
Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. -- numbers 21:31
.
Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there. -- numbers 21:32
.
Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people, for battle at Edrei. -- numbers 21:33
.
But the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon." -- numbers 21:34
.
So they killed him and his sons and all his people, until there was no remnant left him; and they possessed his land. -- numbers 21:35
.
Then the sons of Israel journeyed, and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho. -- numbers 22:1
.
Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. -- numbers 22:2
.
So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel. -- numbers 22:3
.
Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this horde will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field." And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. -- numbers 22:4
.
So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, at Pethor, which is near the River, in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, a people came out of Egypt; behold, they cover the surface of the land, and they are living opposite me. -- numbers 22:5
.
"Now, therefore, please come, curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed." -- numbers 22:6
.
So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam and repeated Balak's words to him. -- numbers 22:7
.
He said to them, "Spend the night here, and I will bring word back to you as the LORD may speak to me." And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam. -- numbers 22:8
.
Then God came to Balaam and said, "Who are these men with you?" -- numbers 22:9
.
Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent word to me, -- numbers 22:10
.
'Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt and they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.'" -- numbers 22:11
.
God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed." -- numbers 22:12
.
So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak's leaders, "Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you." -- numbers 22:13
.
The leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us." -- numbers 22:14
.
Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and more distinguished than the former. -- numbers 22:15
.
They came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Let nothing, I beg you, hinder you from coming to me; -- numbers 22:16
.
for I will indeed honor you richly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Please come then, curse this people for me.'" -- numbers 22:17
.
Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, "Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God. -- numbers 22:18
.
"Now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the LORD will speak to me." -- numbers 22:19
.
God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you shall you do." -- numbers 22:20
.
So Balaam arose in the morning, and saddled his donkey and went with the leaders of Moab. -- numbers 22:21
.
But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him. -- numbers 22:22
.
When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand, the donkey turned off from the way and went into the field; but Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way. -- numbers 22:23
.
Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side. -- numbers 22:24
.
When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed herself to the wall and pressed Balaam's foot against the wall, so he struck her again. -- numbers 22:25
.
The angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right hand or the left. -- numbers 22:26
.
When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his stick. -- numbers 22:27
.
And the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?" -- numbers 22:28
.
Then Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have made a mockery of me! If there had been a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now." -- numbers 22:29
.
The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?" And he said, "No." -- numbers 22:30
.
Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed all the way to the ground. -- numbers 22:31
.
The angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way was contrary to me. -- numbers 22:32
.
"But the donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, I would surely have killed you just now, and let her live." -- numbers 22:33
.
Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back." -- numbers 22:34
.
But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word which I tell you." So Balaam went along with the leaders of Balak. -- numbers 22:35
.
When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the Arnon border, at the extreme end of the border. -- numbers 22:36
.
Then Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not urgently send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to honor you?" -- numbers 22:37
.
So Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come now to you! Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak." -- numbers 22:38
.
And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. -- numbers 22:39
.
Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders who were with him. -- numbers 22:40
.
Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from there a portion of the people. -- numbers 22:41
.
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here." -- numbers 23:1
.
Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. -- numbers 23:2
.
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you." So he went to a bare hill. -- numbers 23:3
.
Now God met Balaam, and he said to Him, "I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar." -- numbers 23:4
.
Then the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and you shall speak thus." -- numbers 23:5
.
So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab. -- numbers 23:6
.
He took up his discourse and said, "From Aram Balak has brought me, Moab's king from the mountains of the East, 'Come curse Jacob for me, And come, denounce Israel!' -- numbers 23:7
.
"How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? And how can I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced? -- numbers 23:8
.
"As I see him from the top of the rocks, And I look at him from the hills; Behold, a people who dwells apart, And will not be reckoned among the nations. -- numbers 23:9
.
"Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, And let my end be like his!" -- numbers 23:10
.
Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have actually blessed them!" -- numbers 23:11
.
He replied, "Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?" -- numbers 23:12
.
Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, although you will only see the extreme end of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there." -- numbers 23:13
.
So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. -- numbers 23:14
.
And he said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offering while I myself meet the LORD over there." -- numbers 23:15
.
Then the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak." -- numbers 23:16
.
He came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, "What has the LORD spoken?" -- numbers 23:17
.
Then he took up his discourse and said, "Arise, O Balak, and hear; Give ear to me, O son of Zippor! -- numbers 23:18
.
"God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good? -- numbers 23:19
.
"Behold, I have received a command to bless; When He has blessed, then I cannot revoke it. -- numbers 23:20
.
"He has not observed misfortune in Jacob; Nor has He seen trouble in Israel; The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them. -- numbers 23:21
.
"God brings them out of Egypt, He is for them like the horns of the wild ox. -- numbers 23:22
.
"For there is no omen against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel; At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob And to Israel, what God has done! -- numbers 23:23
.
"Behold, a people rises like a lioness, And as a lion it lifts itself; It will not lie down until it devours the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain." -- numbers 23:24
.
Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all!" -- numbers 23:25
.
But Balaam replied to Balak, "Did I not tell you, 'Whatever the LORD speaks, that I must do'?" -- numbers 23:26
.
Then Balak said to Balaam, "Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be agreeable with God that you curse them for me from there." -- numbers 23:27
.
So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the wasteland. -- numbers 23:28
.
Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here." -- numbers 23:29
.
Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. -- numbers 23:30
.
When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens but he set his face toward the wilderness. -- numbers 24:1
.
And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him. -- numbers 24:2
.
He took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened; -- numbers 24:3
.
The oracle of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered, -- numbers 24:4
.
How fair are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel! -- numbers 24:5
.
"Like valleys that stretch out, Like gardens beside the river, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters. -- numbers 24:6
.
"Water will flow from his buckets, And his seed will be by many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted. -- numbers 24:7
.
"God brings him out of Egypt, He is for him like the horns of the wild ox. He will devour the nations who are his adversaries, And will crush their bones in pieces, And shatter them with his arrows. -- numbers 24:8
.
"He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, And cursed is everyone who curses you." -- numbers 24:9
.
Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times! -- numbers 24:10
.
"Therefore, flee to your place now. I said I would honor you greatly, but behold, the LORD has held you back from honor." -- numbers 24:11
.
Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, saying, -- numbers 24:12
.
'Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything contrary to the command of the LORD, either good or bad, of my own accord. What the LORD speaks, that I will speak'? -- numbers 24:13
.
"And now, behold, I am going to my people; come, and I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the days to come." -- numbers 24:14
.
He took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened, -- numbers 24:15
.
The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered. -- numbers 24:16
.
"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A star shall come forth from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall crush through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth. -- numbers 24:17
.
"Edom shall be a possession, Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession, While Israel performs valiantly. -- numbers 24:18
.
"One from Jacob shall have dominion, And will destroy the remnant from the city." -- numbers 24:19
.
And he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said, "Amalek was the first of the nations, But his end shall be destruction." -- numbers 24:20
.
And he looked at the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, "Your dwelling place is enduring, And your nest is set in the cliff. -- numbers 24:21
.
"Nevertheless Kain will be consumed; How long will Asshur keep you captive?" -- numbers 24:22
.
Then he took up his discourse and said, "Alas, who can live except God has ordained it? -- numbers 24:23
.
"But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber; So they also will come to destruction." -- numbers 24:24
.
Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went his way. -- numbers 24:25
.
While Israel remained at Shittim, the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab. -- numbers 25:1
.
For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. -- numbers 25:2
.
So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the LORD was angry against Israel. -- numbers 25:3
.
The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel." -- numbers 25:4
.
So Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you slay his men who have joined themselves to Baal of Peor." -- numbers 25:5
.
Then behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his relatives a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- numbers 25:6
.
When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he arose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand, -- numbers 25:7
.
and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, through the body. So the plague on the sons of Israel was checked. -- numbers 25:8
.
Those who died by the plague were 24,000. -- numbers 25:9
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 25:10
.
"Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy. -- numbers 25:11
.
"Therefore say, 'Behold, I give him My covenant of peace; -- numbers 25:12
.
and it shall be for him and his descendants after him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel.'" -- numbers 25:13
.
Now the name of the slain man of Israel who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father's household among the Simeonites. -- numbers 25:14
.
The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was head of the people of a father's household in Midian. -- numbers 25:15
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 25:16
.
"Be hostile to the Midianites and strike them; -- numbers 25:17
.
for they have been hostile to you with their tricks, with which they have deceived you in the affair of Peor and in the affair of Cozbi, the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague because of Peor." -- numbers 25:18
.
Then it came about after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, -- numbers 26:1
.
"Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' households, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel." -- numbers 26:2
.
So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, -- numbers 26:3
.
"Take a census of the people from twenty years old and upward, as the LORD has commanded Moses." Now the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt were: -- numbers 26:4

.
and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up along with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured men, so that they became a warning. -- numbers 26:10

These are those who were numbered of the sons of Israel, 601,730. -- numbers 26:51
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 26:52
.
"Among these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names. -- numbers 26:53
.
"To the larger group you shall increase their inheritance, and to the smaller group you shall diminish their inheritance; each shall be given their inheritance according to those who were numbered of them. -- numbers 26:54
.
"But the land shall be divided by lot. They shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers. -- numbers 26:55
.
"According to the selection by lot, their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller groups." -- numbers 26:56
.
These are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites. -- numbers 26:57

.
To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. -- numbers 26:60
.
But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the LORD. -- numbers 26:61
.
Those who were numbered of them were 23,000, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel. -- numbers 26:62
.
These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. -- numbers 26:63
.
But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. -- numbers 26:64
.
For the LORD had said of them, "They shall surely die in the wilderness." And not a man was left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun. -- numbers 26:65
.
Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah and Hoglah and Milcah and Tirzah. -- numbers 27:1
.
They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, saying, -- numbers 27:2
.
"Our father died in the wilderness, yet he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons. -- numbers 27:3
.
"Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father's brothers." -- numbers 27:4
.
So Moses brought their case before the LORD. -- numbers 27:5
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 27:6
.
"The daughters of Zelophehad are right in their statements. You shall surely give them a hereditary possession among their father's brothers, and you shall transfer the inheritance of their father to them. -- numbers 27:7
.
"Further, you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter. -- numbers 27:8
.
'If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. -- numbers 27:9
.
'If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers. -- numbers 27:10
.
'If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his nearest relative in his own family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be a statutory ordinance to the sons of Israel, just as the LORD commanded Moses.'" -- numbers 27:11
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel. -- numbers 27:12
.
"When you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was; -- numbers 27:13
.
for in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to treat Me as holy before their eyes at the water." (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.) -- numbers 27:14
.
Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying, -- numbers 27:15
.
"May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation, -- numbers 27:16
.
who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD will not be like sheep which have no shepherd." -- numbers 27:17
.
So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him; -- numbers 27:18
.
and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him in their sight. -- numbers 27:19
.
"You shall put some of your authority on him, in order that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him. -- numbers 27:20
.
"Moreover, he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD. At his command they shall go out and at his command they shall come in, both he and the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation." -- numbers 27:21
.
Moses did just as the LORD commanded him; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation. -- numbers 27:22
.
Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses. -- numbers 27:23
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 28:1
.
"Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be careful to present My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, of a soothing aroma to Me, at their appointed time.' -- numbers 28:2
.
"You shall say to them, 'This is the offering by fire which you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs one year old without defect as a continual burnt offering every day. -- numbers 28:3
.
'You shall offer the one lamb in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; -- numbers 28:4
.
also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil. -- numbers 28:5
.
'It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. -- numbers 28:6
.
'Then the drink offering with it shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb, in the holy place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD. -- numbers 28:7
.
'The other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to the LORD. -- numbers 28:8
.
'Then on the sabbath day two male lambs one year old without defect, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering: -- numbers 28:9
.
'This is the burnt offering of every sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. -- numbers 28:10
.
'Then at the beginning of each of your months you shall present a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without defect; -- numbers 28:11
.
and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for the one ram; -- numbers 28:12
.
and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering for each lamb, for a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. -- numbers 28:13
.
'Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year. -- numbers 28:14

Moses spoke to the sons of Israel in accordance with all that the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 29:40

"If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or takes an oath to bind himself with a binding obligation, he shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth. -- numbers 30:2

"Also if a woman makes a vow to the LORD, and binds herself by an obligation in her father's house in her youth, -- numbers 30:3

"But if her father should forbid her on the day he hears of it, none of her vows or her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her because her father had forbidden her. -- numbers 30:5
.
"However, if she should marry while under her vows or the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself, -- numbers 30:6

"But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her. -- numbers 30:9
.
"However, if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound herself by an obligation with an oath, -- numbers 30:10

.
"Every vow and every binding oath to humble herself, her husband may confirm it or her husband may annul it. -- numbers 30:13
.

"But if he indeed annuls them after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt." -- numbers 30:15
.
These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, as between a man and his wife, and as between a father and his daughter, while she is in her youth in her father's house. -- numbers 30:16
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 31:1
.
"Take full vengeance for the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people." -- numbers 31:2
.
Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD'S vengeance on Midian. -- numbers 31:3
.
"A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war." -- numbers 31:4
.
So there were furnished from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. -- numbers 31:5
.
Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war with them, and the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. -- numbers 31:6
.
So they made war against Midian, just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male. -- numbers 31:7
.
They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword. -- numbers 31:8
.
The sons of Israel captured the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they plundered. -- numbers 31:9
.
Then they burned all their cities where they lived and all their camps with fire. -- numbers 31:10
.
They took all the spoil and all the prey, both of man and of beast. -- numbers 31:11
.
They brought the captives and the prey and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan opposite Jericho. -- numbers 31:12
.
Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp. -- numbers 31:13
.
Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who had come from service in the war. -- numbers 31:14
.
And Moses said to them, "Have you spared all the women? -- numbers 31:15
.
"Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, so the plague was among the congregation of the LORD. -- numbers 31:16
.
"Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. -- numbers 31:17
.
"But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves. -- numbers 31:18
.
"And you, camp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves, you and your captives, on the third day and on the seventh day. -- numbers 31:19
.
"You shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of leather and all the work of goats' hair, and all articles of wood." -- numbers 31:20
.
Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle, "This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses: -- numbers 31:21
.
only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin and the lead, -- numbers 31:22
.
everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean, but it shall be purified with water for impurity. But whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water. -- numbers 31:23
.
"And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may enter the camp." -- numbers 31:24
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 31:25
.
"You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' households of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured, both of man and of animal; -- numbers 31:26
.
and divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation. -- numbers 31:27
.
"Levy a tax for the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep; -- numbers 31:28
.
take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as an offering to the LORD. -- numbers 31:29
.
"From the sons of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD." -- numbers 31:30
.
Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 31:31
.
Now the booty that remained from the spoil which the men of war had plundered was 675,sheep, -- numbers 31:32
.
and 72,cattle, -- numbers 31:33
.
and 61,donkeys, -- numbers 31:34
.
and of human beings, of the women who had not known man intimately, all the persons were 32,000. -- numbers 31:35
.
The half, the portion of those who went out to war, was as follows: the number of sheep was 337,500, -- numbers 31:36
.
and the LORD'S levy of the sheep was 675; -- numbers 31:37
.
and the cattle were 36,000, from which the LORD'S levy was 72; -- numbers 31:38
.
and the donkeys were 30,500, from which the LORD'S levy was 61; -- numbers 31:39
.
and the human beings were 16,000, from whom the LORD'S levy was persons. -- numbers 31:40
.
Moses gave the levy which was the LORD'S offering to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 31:41
.
As for the sons of Israel's half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war-- -- numbers 31:42
.
now the congregation's half was 337,sheep, -- numbers 31:43
.
and 36,cattle, -- numbers 31:44
.
and 30,donkeys, -- numbers 31:45
.
and the human beings were 16,000-- -- numbers 31:46
.
and from the sons of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- numbers 31:47
.
Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses, -- numbers 31:48
.
and they said to Moses, "Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing. -- numbers 31:49
.
"So we have brought as an offering to the LORD what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD." -- numbers 31:50
.
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of wrought articles. -- numbers 31:51
.
All the gold of the offering which they offered up to the LORD, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, was 16,shekels. -- numbers 31:52
.
The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself. -- numbers 31:53
.
So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD. -- numbers 31:54
.
Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had an exceedingly large number of livestock. So when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that it was indeed a place suitable for livestock, -- numbers 32:1
.
the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying, -- numbers 32:2
.
"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon, -- numbers 32:3
.
the land which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock." -- numbers 32:4
.
They said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the Jordan." -- numbers 32:5
.
But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here? -- numbers 32:6
.
"Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which the LORD has given them? -- numbers 32:7
.
"This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. -- numbers 32:8
.
"For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the sons of Israel so that they did not go into the land which the LORD had given them. -- numbers 32:9
.
"So the LORD'S anger burned in that day, and He swore, saying, -- numbers 32:10
.
'None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob; for they did not follow Me fully, -- numbers 32:11
.
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have followed the LORD fully.' -- numbers 32:12
.
"So the LORD'S anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of the LORD was destroyed. -- numbers 32:13
.
"Now behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of the LORD against Israel. -- numbers 32:14
.
"For if you turn away from following Him, He will once more abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people." -- numbers 32:15
.
Then they came near to him and said, "We will build here sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our little ones; -- numbers 32:16
.
but we ourselves will be armed ready to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. -- numbers 32:17
.
"We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has possessed his inheritance. -- numbers 32:18
.
"For we will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan toward the east." -- numbers 32:19
.
So Moses said to them, "If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for the war, -- numbers 32:20
.
and all of you armed men cross over the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies out from before Him, -- numbers 32:21
.
and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you shall return and be free of obligation toward the LORD and toward Israel, and this land shall be yours for a possession before the LORD. -- numbers 32:22
.
"But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out. -- numbers 32:23
.
"Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and sheepfolds for your sheep, and do what you have promised." -- numbers 32:24
.
The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do just as my lord commands. -- numbers 32:25
.
"Our little ones, our wives, our livestock and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead; -- numbers 32:26
.
while your servants, everyone who is armed for war, will cross over in the presence of the LORD to battle, just as my lord says." -- numbers 32:27
.
So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' households of the tribes of the sons of Israel. -- numbers 32:28
.
Moses said to them, "If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross with you over the Jordan in the presence of the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession; -- numbers 32:29
.
but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan." -- numbers 32:30
.
The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, "As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do. -- numbers 32:31
.
"We ourselves will cross over armed in the presence of the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us across the Jordan." -- numbers 32:32
.
So Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Joseph's son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities with their territories, the cities of the surrounding land. -- numbers 32:33
.
The sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer, -- numbers 32:34
.
and Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah, -- numbers 32:35
.
and Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and sheepfolds for sheep. -- numbers 32:36
.
The sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim, -- numbers 32:37
.
and Nebo and Baal-meon--their names being changed--and Sibmah, and they gave other names to the cities which they built. -- numbers 32:38
.
The sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it. -- numbers 32:39
.
So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it. -- numbers 32:40
.
Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth-jair. -- numbers 32:41
.
Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah after his own name. -- numbers 32:42
.
These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, by which they came out from the land of Egypt by their armies, under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. -- numbers 33:1
.
Moses recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the LORD, and these are their journeys according to their starting places. -- numbers 33:2
.
They journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the sons of Israel started out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians, -- numbers 33:3
.
while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn whom the LORD had struck down among them. The LORD had also executed judgments on their gods. -- numbers 33:4
.
Then the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses and camped in Succoth. -- numbers 33:5
.
They journeyed from Succoth and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness. -- numbers 33:6
.
They journeyed from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol. -- numbers 33:7
.
They journeyed from before Hahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah. -- numbers 33:8
.
They journeyed from Marah and came to Elim; and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there. -- numbers 33:9
.
They journeyed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea. -- numbers 33:10
.
They journeyed from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin. -- numbers 33:11
.
They journeyed from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah. -- numbers 33:12
.
They journeyed from Dophkah and camped at Alush. -- numbers 33:13
.
They journeyed from Alush and camped at Rephidim; now it was there that the people had no water to drink. -- numbers 33:14
.
They journeyed from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai. -- numbers 33:15
.
They journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah. -- numbers 33:16
.
They journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. -- numbers 33:17
.
They journeyed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah. -- numbers 33:18
.
They journeyed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez. -- numbers 33:19
.
They journeyed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah. -- numbers 33:20
.
They journeyed from Libnah and camped at Rissah. -- numbers 33:21
.
They journeyed from Rissah and camped in Kehelathah. -- numbers 33:22
.
They journeyed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher. -- numbers 33:23
.
They journeyed from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah. -- numbers 33:24
.
They journeyed from Haradah and camped at Makheloth. -- numbers 33:25
.
They journeyed from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. -- numbers 33:26
.
They journeyed from Tahath and camped at Terah. -- numbers 33:27
.
They journeyed from Terah and camped at Mithkah. -- numbers 33:28
.
They journeyed from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah. -- numbers 33:29
.
They journeyed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth. -- numbers 33:30
.
They journeyed from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan. -- numbers 33:31
.
They journeyed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad. -- numbers 33:32
.
They journeyed from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah. -- numbers 33:33
.
They journeyed from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. -- numbers 33:34
.
They journeyed from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber. -- numbers 33:35
.
They journeyed from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, that is, Kadesh. -- numbers 33:36
.
They journeyed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom. -- numbers 33:37
.
Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of the LORD, and died there in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel had come from the land of Egypt, on the first day in the fifth month. -- numbers 33:38
.
Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. -- numbers 33:39
.
Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the sons of Israel. -- numbers 33:40
.
Then they journeyed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. -- numbers 33:41
.
They journeyed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon. -- numbers 33:42
.
They journeyed from Punon and camped at Oboth. -- numbers 33:43
.
They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, at the border of Moab. -- numbers 33:44
.
They journeyed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad. -- numbers 33:45
.
They journeyed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim. -- numbers 33:46
.
They journeyed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. -- numbers 33:47
.
They journeyed from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho. -- numbers 33:48
.
They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab. -- numbers 33:49
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying, -- numbers 33:50
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, -- numbers 33:51
.
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places; -- numbers 33:52
.
and you shall take possession of the land and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it. -- numbers 33:53
.
'You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the larger you shall give more inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to anyone, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers. -- numbers 33:54
.
'But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come about that those whom you let remain of them will become as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land in which you live. -- numbers 33:55
.
'And as I plan to do to them, so I will do to you.'" -- numbers 33:56
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 34:1
.
"Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders. -- numbers 34:2
.
'Your southern sector shall extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern border shall extend from the end of the Salt Sea eastward. -- numbers 34:3
.
'Then your border shall turn direction from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and continue to Zin, and its termination shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall reach Hazaraddar and continue to Azmon. -- numbers 34:4
.
'The border shall turn direction from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its termination shall be at the sea. -- numbers 34:5
.
'As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea, that is, its coastline; this shall be your west border. -- numbers 34:6
.
'And this shall be your north border: you shall draw your border line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor. -- numbers 34:7
.
'You shall draw a line from Mount Hor to the Lebo-hamath, and the termination of the border shall be at Zedad; -- numbers 34:8
.
and the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and its termination shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border. -- numbers 34:9
.
'For your eastern border you shall also draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham, -- numbers 34:10
.
and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth. -- numbers 34:11
.
'And the border shall go down to the Jordan and its termination shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders all around.'" -- numbers 34:12
.
So Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the land that you are to apportion by lot among you as a possession, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes. -- numbers 34:13
.
"For the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received theirs according to their fathers' households, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers' households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession. -- numbers 34:14
.
"The two and a half tribes have received their possession across the Jordan opposite Jericho, eastward toward the sunrising." -- numbers 34:15
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 34:16
.
"These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun. -- numbers 34:17
.
"You shall take one leader of every tribe to apportion the land for inheritance. -- numbers 34:18
.
"These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. -- numbers 34:19
.
"Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud. -- numbers 34:20
.
"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. -- numbers 34:21
.
"Of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli. -- numbers 34:22
.
"Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod. -- numbers 34:23
.
"Of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. -- numbers 34:24
.
"Of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. -- numbers 34:25
.
"Of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan. -- numbers 34:26
.
"Of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. -- numbers 34:27
.
"Of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud." -- numbers 34:28
.
These are those whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan. -- numbers 34:29
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying, -- numbers 35:1
.
"Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to live in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities. -- numbers 35:2
.
"The cities shall be theirs to live in; and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their herds and for all their beasts. -- numbers 35:3
.
"The pasture lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits around. -- numbers 35:4
.
"You shall also measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the center. This shall become theirs as pasture lands for the cities. -- numbers 35:5
.
"The cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities. -- numbers 35:6
.
"All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, together with their pasture lands. -- numbers 35:7
.
"As for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, you shall take more from the larger and you shall take less from the smaller; each shall give some of his cities to the Levites in proportion to his possession which he inherits." -- numbers 35:8
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- numbers 35:9
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, -- numbers 35:10
.
then you shall select for yourselves cities to be your cities of refuge, that the manslayer who has killed any person unintentionally may flee there. -- numbers 35:11
.
'The cities shall be to you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands before the congregation for trial. -- numbers 35:12
.
'The cities which you are to give shall be your six cities of refuge. -- numbers 35:13
.
'You shall give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they are to be cities of refuge. -- numbers 35:14
.
'These six cities shall be for refuge for the sons of Israel, and for the alien and for the sojourner among them; that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there. -- numbers 35:15
.
'But if he struck him down with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. -- numbers 35:16
.
'If he struck him down with a stone in the hand, by which he will die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. -- numbers 35:17
.
'Or if he struck him with a wooden object in the hand, by which he might die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. -- numbers 35:18
.
'The blood avenger himself shall put the murderer to death; he shall put him to death when he meets him. -- numbers 35:19
.
'If he pushed him of hatred, or threw something at him lying in wait and as a result he died, -- numbers 35:20
.
or if he struck him down with his hand in enmity, and as a result he died, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death, he is a murderer; the blood avenger shall put the murderer to death when he meets him. -- numbers 35:21
.
'But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or threw something at him without lying in wait, -- numbers 35:22
.
or with any deadly object of stone, and without seeing it dropped on him so that he died, while he was not his enemy nor seeking his injury, -- numbers 35:23
.
then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger according to these ordinances. -- numbers 35:24
.
'The congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil. -- numbers 35:25
.
'But if the manslayer at any time goes beyond the border of his city of refuge to which he may flee, -- numbers 35:26
.
and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the blood avenger kills the manslayer, he will not be guilty of blood -- numbers 35:27
.
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession. -- numbers 35:28
.
'These things shall be for a statutory ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. -- numbers 35:29
.
'If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death at the evidence of witnesses, but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness. -- numbers 35:30
.
'Moreover, you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death. -- numbers 35:31
.
'You shall not take ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest. -- numbers 35:32
.
'So you shall not pollute the land in which you are; for blood pollutes the land and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it. -- numbers 35:33
.
'You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD am dwelling in the midst of the sons of Israel.'" -- numbers 35:34
.
And the heads of the fathers' households of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers' households of the sons of Israel, -- numbers 36:1
.
and they said, "The LORD commanded my lord to give the land by lot to the sons of Israel as an inheritance, and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. -- numbers 36:2
.
"But if they marry one of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; thus it will be withdrawn from our allotted inheritance. -- numbers 36:3
.
"When the jubilee of the sons of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers." -- numbers 36:4
.
Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph are right in their statements. -- numbers 36:5
.
"This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, 'Let them marry whom they wish; only they must marry within the family of the tribe of their father.' -- numbers 36:6
.
"Thus no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for the sons of Israel shall each hold to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. -- numbers 36:7
.
"Every daughter who comes into possession of an inheritance of any tribe of the sons of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers. -- numbers 36:8
.
"Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall each hold to his own inheritance." -- numbers 36:9
.
Just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did: -- numbers 36:10
.
Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad married their uncles' sons. -- numbers 36:11
.
They married those from the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father. -- numbers 36:12
.
These are the commandments and the ordinances which the LORD commanded to the sons of Israel through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho. -- numbers 36:13
.
These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab. -- deuteronomy 1:1
.
It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. -- deuteronomy 1:2
.
In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had commanded him to give to them, -- deuteronomy 1:3
.
after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei. -- deuteronomy 1:4
.
Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law, saying, -- deuteronomy 1:5
.
"The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain. -- deuteronomy 1:6
.
'Turn and set your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negev and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. -- deuteronomy 1:7
.
'See, I have placed the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to them and their descendants after them.' -- deuteronomy 1:8
.
"I spoke to you at that time, saying, 'I am not able to bear the burden of you alone. -- deuteronomy 1:9
.
'The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day like the stars of heaven in number. -- deuteronomy 1:10
.
'May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand-fold more than you are and bless you, just as He has promised you! -- deuteronomy 1:11
.
'How can I alone bear the load and burden of you and your strife? -- deuteronomy 1:12
.
'Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.' -- deuteronomy 1:13
.
"You answered me and said, 'The thing which you have said to do is good.' -- deuteronomy 1:14
.
"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and appointed them heads over you, leaders of thousands and of hundreds, of fifties and of tens, and officers for your tribes. -- deuteronomy 1:15
.
"Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen, and judge righteously between a man and his fellow countryman, or the alien who is with him. -- deuteronomy 1:16
.
'You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God's. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.' -- deuteronomy 1:17
.
"I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do. -- deuteronomy 1:18
.
"Then we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. -- deuteronomy 1:19
.
"I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the LORD our God is about to give us. -- deuteronomy 1:20
.
'See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you; go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear or be dismayed.' -- deuteronomy 1:21
.
"Then all of you approached me and said, 'Let us send men before us, that they may search out the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we should go up and the cities which we shall enter.' -- deuteronomy 1:22
.
"The thing pleased me and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe. -- deuteronomy 1:23
.
"They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol and spied it out. -- deuteronomy 1:24
.
"Then they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought us back a report and said, 'It is a good land which the LORD our God is about to give us.' -- deuteronomy 1:25
.
"Yet you were not willing to go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; -- deuteronomy 1:26
.
and you grumbled in your tents and said, 'Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. -- deuteronomy 1:27
.
'Where can we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are bigger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified to heaven. And besides, we saw the sons of the Anakim there."' -- deuteronomy 1:28
.
"Then I said to you, 'Do not be shocked, nor fear them. -- deuteronomy 1:29
.
'The LORD your God who goes before you will Himself fight on your behalf, just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes, -- deuteronomy 1:30
.
and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, just as a man carries his son, in all the way which you have walked until you came to this place.' -- deuteronomy 1:31
.
"But for all this, you did not trust the LORD your God, -- deuteronomy 1:32
.
who goes before you on your way, to seek out a place for you to encamp, in fire by night and cloud by day, to show you the way in which you should go. -- deuteronomy 1:33
.
"Then the LORD heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and took an oath, saying, -- deuteronomy 1:34
.
'Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which I swore to give your fathers, -- deuteronomy 1:35
.
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his sons I will give the land on which he has set foot, because he has followed the LORD fully.' -- deuteronomy 1:36
.
"The LORD was angry with me also on your account, saying, 'Not even you shall enter there. -- deuteronomy 1:37
.
'Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter there; encourage him, for he will cause Israel to inherit it. -- deuteronomy 1:38
.
'Moreover, your little ones who you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them and they shall possess it. -- deuteronomy 1:39
.
'But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.' -- deuteronomy 1:40
.
"Then you said to me, 'We have sinned against the LORD; we will indeed go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every man of you girded on his weapons of war, and regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country. -- deuteronomy 1:41
.
"And the LORD said to me, 'Say to them, "Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; otherwise you will be defeated before your enemies."' -- deuteronomy 1:42
.
"So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country. -- deuteronomy 1:43
.
"The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah. -- deuteronomy 1:44
.
"Then you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not listen to your voice nor give ear to you. -- deuteronomy 1:45
.
"So you remained in Kadesh many days, the days that you spent there. -- deuteronomy 1:46
.
"Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me, and circled Mount Seir for many days. -- deuteronomy 2:1
.
"And the LORD spoke to me, saying, -- deuteronomy 2:2
.
'You have circled this mountain long enough. Now turn north, -- deuteronomy 2:3
.
and command the people, saying, "You will pass through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful; -- deuteronomy 2:4
.
do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, even as little as a footstep because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. -- deuteronomy 2:5
.
"You shall buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and you shall also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink. -- deuteronomy 2:6
.
"For the LORD your God has blessed you in all that you have done; He has known your wanderings through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing."' -- deuteronomy 2:7
.
"So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road, away from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed through by the way of the wilderness of Moab. -- deuteronomy 2:8
.
"Then the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab, nor provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.' -- deuteronomy 2:9
.
(The Emim lived there formerly, a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim. -- deuteronomy 2:10
.
Like the Anakim, they are also regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. -- deuteronomy 2:11
.
The Horites formerly lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave to them.) -- deuteronomy 2:12
.
'Now arise and cross over the brook Zered yourselves.' So we crossed over the brook Zered. -- deuteronomy 2:13
.
"Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them. -- deuteronomy 2:14
.
"Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from within the camp until they all perished. -- deuteronomy 2:15
.
"So it came about when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people, -- deuteronomy 2:16
.
that the LORD spoke to me, saying, -- deuteronomy 2:17
.
'Today you shall cross over Ar, the border of Moab. -- deuteronomy 2:18
.
'When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not harass them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.' -- deuteronomy 2:19
.
(It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim formerly lived in it, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin, -- deuteronomy 2:20
.
a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, but the LORD destroyed them before them. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place, -- deuteronomy 2:21
.
just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day. -- deuteronomy 2:22
.
And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) -- deuteronomy 2:23
.
'Arise, set out, and pass through the valley of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession and contend with him in battle. -- deuteronomy 2:24
.
'This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.' -- deuteronomy 2:25
.
"So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, -- deuteronomy 2:26
.
'Let me pass through your land, I will travel only on the highway; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left. -- deuteronomy 2:27
.
'You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot, -- deuteronomy 2:28
.
just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God is giving to us.' -- deuteronomy 2:29
.
"But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to deliver him into your hand, as he is today. -- deuteronomy 2:30
.
"The LORD said to me, 'See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to occupy, that you may possess his land.' -- deuteronomy 2:31
.
"Then Sihon with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz. -- deuteronomy 2:32
.
"The LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him with his sons and all his people. -- deuteronomy 2:33
.
"So we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men, women and children of every city. We left no survivor. -- deuteronomy 2:34
.
"We took only the animals as our booty and the spoil of the cities which we had captured. -- deuteronomy 2:35
.
"From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon and from the city which is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too high for us; the LORD our God delivered all over to us. -- deuteronomy 2:36
.
"Only you did not go near to the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God had commanded us. -- deuteronomy 2:37
.
"Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Edrei. -- deuteronomy 3:1
.
"But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.' -- deuteronomy 3:2
.
"So the LORD our God delivered Og also, king of Bashan, with all his people into our hand, and we smote them until no survivor was left. -- deuteronomy 3:3
.
"We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. -- deuteronomy 3:4
.
"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns. -- deuteronomy 3:5
.
"We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women and children of every city. -- deuteronomy 3:6
.
"But all the animals and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty. -- deuteronomy 3:7
.
"Thus we took the land at that time from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon -- deuteronomy 3:8
.
(Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir): -- deuteronomy 3:9
.
all the cities of the plateau and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. -- deuteronomy 3:10
.
(For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead; it is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. Its length was nine cubits and its width four cubits by ordinary cubit.) -- deuteronomy 3:11
.
"So we took possession of this land at that time. From Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. -- deuteronomy 3:12
.
"The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob (concerning all Bashan, it is called the land of Rephaim. -- deuteronomy 3:13
.
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called it, that is, Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.) -- deuteronomy 3:14
.
"To Machir I gave Gilead. -- deuteronomy 3:15
.
"To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even as far as the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley as a border and as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon; -- deuteronomy 3:16
.
the Arabah also, with the Jordan as a border, from Chinnereth even as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east. -- deuteronomy 3:17
.
"Then I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it; all you valiant men shall cross over armed before your brothers, the sons of Israel. -- deuteronomy 3:18
.
'But your wives and your little ones and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you, -- deuteronomy 3:19
.
until the LORD gives rest to your fellow countrymen as to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God will give them beyond the Jordan. Then you may return every man to his possession which I have given you.' -- deuteronomy 3:20
.
"I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so the LORD shall do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross. -- deuteronomy 3:21
.
'Do not fear them, for the LORD your God is the one fighting for you.' -- deuteronomy 3:22
.
"I also pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying, -- deuteronomy 3:23
.
'O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as Yours? -- deuteronomy 3:24
.
