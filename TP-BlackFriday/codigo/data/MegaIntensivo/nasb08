but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they will put us to death or exile us to Babylon." -- jeremiah 43:3
.
So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah. -- jeremiah 43:4
.
But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven away, in order to reside in the land of Judah-- -- jeremiah 43:5
.
the men, the women, the children, the king's daughters and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah-- -- jeremiah 43:6
.
and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the LORD) and went in as far as Tahpanhes. -- jeremiah 43:7
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, -- jeremiah 43:8
.
"Take some large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace which is at the entrance of Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of some of the Jews; -- jeremiah 43:9
.
and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Behold, I am going to send and get Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and I am going to set his throne right over these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his canopy over them. -- jeremiah 43:10
.
"He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are meant for death will be given over to death, and those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword. -- jeremiah 43:11
.
"And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there safely. -- jeremiah 43:12
.
"He will also shatter the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire."'" -- jeremiah 43:13
.
The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying, -- jeremiah 44:1
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them, -- jeremiah 44:2
.
because of their wickedness which they committed so as to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices and to serve other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, nor your fathers. -- jeremiah 44:3
.
'Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, again and again, saying, "Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate." -- jeremiah 44:4
.
'But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods. -- jeremiah 44:5
.
'Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become a ruin and a desolation as it is this day. -- jeremiah 44:6
.
'Now then thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, "Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, so as to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, from among Judah, leaving yourselves without remnant, -- jeremiah 44:7
.
provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are entering to reside, so that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? -- jeremiah 44:8
.
"Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? -- jeremiah 44:9
.
"But they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers."' -- jeremiah 44:10
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am going to set My face against you for woe, even to cut off all Judah. -- jeremiah 44:11
.
'And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their mind on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword and meet their end by famine. Both small and great will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach. -- jeremiah 44:12
.
'And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine and with pestilence. -- jeremiah 44:13
.
'So there will be no refugees or survivors for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of Judah, to which they are longing to return and live; for none will return except a few refugees.'" -- jeremiah 44:14
.
Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, as a large assembly, including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 44:15
.
"As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we are not going to listen to you! -- jeremiah 44:16
.
"But rather we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food and were well off and saw no misfortune. -- jeremiah 44:17
.
"But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have met our end by the sword and by famine." -- jeremiah 44:18
.
"And," said the women, "when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and were pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?" -- jeremiah 44:19
.
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women--even to all the people who were giving him such an answer--saying, -- jeremiah 44:20
.
"As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them and did not all this come into His mind? -- jeremiah 44:21
.
"So the LORD was no longer able to endure it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; thus your land has become a ruin, an object of horror and a curse, without an inhabitant, as it is this day. -- jeremiah 44:22
.
"Because you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the LORD and not obeyed the voice of the LORD or walked in His law, His statutes or His testimonies, therefore this calamity has befallen you, as it has this day." -- jeremiah 44:23
.
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt, -- jeremiah 44:24
.
thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, as follows: 'As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, "We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her." Go ahead and confirm your vows, and certainly perform your vows!' -- jeremiah 44:25
.
"Nevertheless hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt, 'Behold, I have sworn by My great name,' says the LORD, 'never shall My name be invoked again by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, "As the Lord GOD lives." -- jeremiah 44:26
.
'Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword and by famine until they are completely gone. -- jeremiah 44:27
.
'Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs. -- jeremiah 44:28
.
'This will be the sign to you,' declares the LORD, 'that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for harm.' -- jeremiah 44:29
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am going to give over Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt to the hand of his enemies, to the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave over Zedekiah king of Judah to the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and was seeking his life.'" -- jeremiah 44:30
.
This is the message which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written down these words in a book at Jeremiah's dictation, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: -- jeremiah 45:1
.
"Thus says the LORD the God of Israel to you, O Baruch: -- jeremiah 45:2
.
'You said, "Ah, woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and have found no rest."' -- jeremiah 45:3
.
"Thus you are to say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to uproot, that is, the whole land." -- jeremiah 45:4
.
'But you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I am going to bring disaster on all flesh,' declares the LORD, 'but I will give your life to you as booty in all the places where you may go.'" -- jeremiah 45:5
.

.
To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: -- jeremiah 46:2
.

.
"Harness the horses, And mount the steeds, And take your stand with helmets on! Polish the spears, Put on the scale-armor! -- jeremiah 46:4
.
"Why have I seen it? They are terrified, They are drawing back, And their mighty men are defeated And have taken refuge in flight, Without facing back; Terror is on every side!" Declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 46:5
.
Let not the swift man flee, Nor the mighty man escape; In the north beside the river Euphrates They have stumbled and fallen. -- jeremiah 46:6
.
Who is this that rises like the Nile, Like the rivers whose waters surge about? -- jeremiah 46:7
.
Egypt rises like the Nile, Even like the rivers whose waters surge about; And He has said, "I will rise and cover that land; I will surely destroy the city and its inhabitants." -- jeremiah 46:8
.
Go up, you horses, and drive madly, you chariots, That the mighty men may march forward: Ethiopia and Put, that handle the shield, And the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow. -- jeremiah 46:9
.
For that day belongs to the Lord GOD of hosts, A day of vengeance, so as to avenge Himself on His foes; And the sword will devour and be satiated And drink its fill of their blood; For there will be a slaughter for the Lord GOD of hosts, In the land of the north by the river Euphrates. -- jeremiah 46:10
.
Go up to Gilead and obtain balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain have you multiplied remedies; There is no healing for you. -- jeremiah 46:11

.
"For a nation has come up against her out of the north; it will make her land an object of horror, and there will be no inhabitant in it. Both man and beast have wandered off, they have gone away! -- jeremiah 50:3
.
"In those days and at that time," declares the LORD, "the sons of Israel will come, both they and the sons of Judah as well; they will go along weeping as they go, and it will be the LORD their God they will seek. -- jeremiah 50:4

.
The LORD has opened His armory And has brought forth the weapons of His indignation, For it is a work of the Lord GOD of hosts In the land of the Chaldeans. -- jeremiah 50:25
.
Come to her from the farthest border; Open up her barns, Pile her up like heaps And utterly destroy her, Let nothing be left to her. -- jeremiah 50:26
.

.
"Their Redeemer is strong, the LORD of hosts is His name; He will vigorously plead their case So that He may bring rest to the earth, But turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon. -- jeremiah 50:34
.
"A sword against the Chaldeans," declares the LORD, "And against the inhabitants of Babylon And against her officials and her wise men! -- jeremiah 50:35
.
"A sword against the oracle priests, and they will become fools! A sword against her mighty men, and they will be shattered! -- jeremiah 50:36
.
"A sword against their horses and against their chariots And against all the foreigners who are in the midst of her, And they will become women! A sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered! -- jeremiah 50:37
.
"A drought on her waters, and they will be dried up! For it is a land of idols, And they are mad over fearsome idols. -- jeremiah 50:38
.
"Therefore the desert creatures will live there along with the jackals; The ostriches also will live in it, And it will never again be inhabited Or dwelt in from generation to generation. -- jeremiah 50:39
.
"As when God overthrew Sodom And Gomorrah with its neighbors," declares the LORD, "No man will live there, Nor will any son of man reside in it. -- jeremiah 50:40
.
"Behold, a people is coming from the north, And a great nation and many kings Will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth. -- jeremiah 50:41

.
"The king of Babylon has heard the report about them, And his hands hang limp; Distress has gripped him, Agony like a woman in childbirth. -- jeremiah 50:43
.
"Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will make them run away from it, and whoever is chosen I will appoint over it. For who is like Me, and who will summon Me into court? And who then is the shepherd who can stand before Me?" -- jeremiah 50:44
.
Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned against Babylon, and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: surely they will drag them off, even the little ones of the flock; surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them. -- jeremiah 50:45
.
At the shout, "Babylon has been seized!" the earth is shaken, and an outcry is heard among the nations. -- jeremiah 50:46
.
Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I am going to arouse against Babylon And against the inhabitants of Leb-kamai The spirit of a destroyer. -- jeremiah 51:1
.
"I will dispatch foreigners to Babylon that they may winnow her And may devastate her land; For on every side they will be opposed to her In the day of her calamity. -- jeremiah 51:2
.
"Let not him who bends his bow bend it, Nor let him rise up in his scale-armor; So do not spare her young men; Devote all her army to destruction. -- jeremiah 51:3
.
"They will fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, And pierced through in their streets." -- jeremiah 51:4
.
For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken By his God, the LORD of hosts, Although their land is full of guilt Before the Holy One of Israel. -- jeremiah 51:5
.
Flee from the midst of Babylon, And each of you save his life! Do not be destroyed in her punishment, For this is the LORD'S time of vengeance; He is going to render recompense to her. -- jeremiah 51:6
.
Babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of the LORD, Intoxicating all the earth. The nations have drunk of her wine; Therefore the nations are going mad. -- jeremiah 51:7
.
Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken; Wail over her! Bring balm for her pain; Perhaps she may be healed. -- jeremiah 51:8
.
We applied healing to Babylon, but she was not healed; Forsake her and let us each go to his own country, For her judgment has reached to heaven And towers up to the very skies. -- jeremiah 51:9
.
The LORD has brought about our vindication; Come and let us recount in Zion The work of the LORD our God! -- jeremiah 51:10
.
Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers! The LORD has aroused the spirit of the kings of the Medes, Because His purpose is against Babylon to destroy it; For it is the vengeance of the LORD, vengeance for His temple. -- jeremiah 51:11
.
Lift up a signal against the walls of Babylon; Post a strong guard, Station sentries, Place men in ambush! For the LORD has both purposed and performed What He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon. -- jeremiah 51:12
.
O you who dwell by many waters, Abundant in treasures, Your end has come, The measure of your end. -- jeremiah 51:13
.
The LORD of hosts has sworn by Himself: "Surely I will fill you with a population like locusts, And they will cry out with shouts of victory over you." -- jeremiah 51:14
.
It is He who made the earth by His power, Who established the world by His wisdom, And by His understanding He stretched out the heavens. -- jeremiah 51:15
.
When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain And brings forth the wind from His storehouses. -- jeremiah 51:16
.
All mankind is stupid, devoid of knowledge; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, For his molten images are deceitful, And there is no breath in them. -- jeremiah 51:17
.
They are worthless, a work of mockery; In the time of their punishment they will perish. -- jeremiah 51:18
.
The portion of Jacob is not like these; For the Maker of all is He, And of the tribe of His inheritance; The LORD of hosts is His name. -- jeremiah 51:19
.
He says, "You are My war-club, My weapon of war; And with you I shatter nations, And with you I destroy kingdoms. -- jeremiah 51:20
.
"With you I shatter the horse and his rider, And with you I shatter the chariot and its rider, -- jeremiah 51:21
.
And with you I shatter man and woman, And with you I shatter old man and youth, And with you I shatter young man and virgin, -- jeremiah 51:22
.
And with you I shatter the shepherd and his flock, And with you I shatter the farmer and his team, And with you I shatter governors and prefects. -- jeremiah 51:23
.
"But I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all their evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 51:24
.
"Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, Who destroys the whole earth," declares the LORD, "And I will stretch out My hand against you, And roll you down from the crags, And I will make you a burnt out mountain. -- jeremiah 51:25
.
"They will not take from you even a stone for a corner Nor a stone for foundations, But you will be desolate forever," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 51:26
.
Lift up a signal in the land, Blow a trumpet among the nations! Consecrate the nations against her, Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz; Appoint a marshal against her, Bring up the horses like bristly locusts. -- jeremiah 51:27
.
Consecrate the nations against her, The kings of the Medes, Their governors and all their prefects, And every land of their dominion. -- jeremiah 51:28
.
So the land quakes and writhes, For the purposes of the LORD against Babylon stand, To make the land of Babylon A desolation without inhabitants. -- jeremiah 51:29
.
The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting, They stay in the strongholds; Their strength is exhausted, They are becoming like women; Their dwelling places are set on fire, The bars of her gates are broken. -- jeremiah 51:30
.
One courier runs to meet another, And one messenger to meet another, To tell the king of Babylon That his city has been captured from end to end; -- jeremiah 51:31
.
The fords also have been seized, And they have burned the marshes with fire, And the men of war are terrified. -- jeremiah 51:32
.
For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor At the time it is stamped firm; Yet in a little while the time of harvest will come for her." -- jeremiah 51:33
.
"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me and crushed me, He has set me down like an empty vessel; He has swallowed me like a monster, He has filled his stomach with my delicacies; He has washed me away. -- jeremiah 51:34
.
"May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon," The inhabitant of Zion will say; And, "May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea," Jerusalem will say. -- jeremiah 51:35
.
Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am going to plead your case And exact full vengeance for you; And I will dry up her sea And make her fountain dry. -- jeremiah 51:36
.
"Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, An object of horror and hissing, without inhabitants. -- jeremiah 51:37
.
"They will roar together like young lions, They will growl like lions' cubs. -- jeremiah 51:38
.
"When they become heated up, I will serve them their banquet And make them drunk, that they may become jubilant And may sleep a perpetual sleep And not wake up," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 51:39
.
"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, Like rams together with male goats. -- jeremiah 51:40
.
"How Sheshak has been captured, And the praise of the whole earth been seized! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations! -- jeremiah 51:41
.
"The sea has come up over Babylon; She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves. -- jeremiah 51:42
.
"Her cities have become an object of horror, A parched land and a desert, A land in which no man lives And through which no son of man passes. -- jeremiah 51:43
.
"I will punish Bel in Babylon, And I will make what he has swallowed come out of his mouth; And the nations will no longer stream to him. Even the wall of Babylon has fallen down! -- jeremiah 51:44
.
"Come forth from her midst, My people, And each of you save yourselves From the fierce anger of the LORD. -- jeremiah 51:45
.
"Now so that your heart does not grow faint, And you are not afraid at the report that will be heard in the land-- For the report will come one year, And after that another report in another year, And violence will be in the land With ruler against ruler-- -- jeremiah 51:46
.
Therefore behold, days are coming When I will punish the idols of Babylon; And her whole land will be put to shame And all her slain will fall in her midst. -- jeremiah 51:47
.
"Then heaven and earth and all that is in them Will shout for joy over Babylon, For the destroyers will come to her from the north," Declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 51:48
.
Indeed Babylon is to fall for the slain of Israel, As also for Babylon the slain of all the earth have fallen. -- jeremiah 51:49
.
You who have escaped the sword, Depart! Do not stay! Remember the LORD from afar, And let Jerusalem come to your mind. -- jeremiah 51:50
.
We are ashamed because we have heard reproach; Disgrace has covered our faces, For aliens have entered The holy places of the LORD'S house. -- jeremiah 51:51
.
"Therefore behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "When I will punish her idols, And the mortally wounded will groan throughout her land. -- jeremiah 51:52
.
"Though Babylon should ascend to the heavens, And though she should fortify her lofty stronghold, From Me destroyers will come to her," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 51:53
.
The sound of an outcry from Babylon, And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans! -- jeremiah 51:54
.
For the LORD is going to destroy Babylon, And He will make her loud noise vanish from her. And their waves will roar like many waters; The tumult of their voices sounds forth. -- jeremiah 51:55
.
For the destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon, And her mighty men will be captured, Their bows are shattered; For the LORD is a God of recompense, He will fully repay. -- jeremiah 51:56
.
"I will make her princes and her wise men drunk, Her governors, her prefects and her mighty men, That they may sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up," Declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. -- jeremiah 51:57
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, "The broad wall of Babylon will be completely razed And her high gates will be set on fire; So the peoples will toil for nothing, And the nations become exhausted only for fire." -- jeremiah 51:58
.
The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. (Now Seraiah was quartermaster.) -- jeremiah 51:59
.
So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the calamity which would come upon Babylon, that is, all these words which have been written concerning Babylon. -- jeremiah 51:60
.
Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "As soon as you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words aloud, -- jeremiah 51:61
.
and say, 'You, O LORD, have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.' -- jeremiah 51:62
.
"And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates, -- jeremiah 51:63
.
and say, 'Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again because of the calamity that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.'" Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. -- jeremiah 51:64
.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. -- jeremiah 52:1
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD like all that Jehoiakim had done. -- jeremiah 52:2
.
For through the anger of the LORD this came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. -- jeremiah 52:3
.
Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it and built a siege wall all around it. -- jeremiah 52:4
.
So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. -- jeremiah 52:5
.
On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. -- jeremiah 52:6
.
Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah. -- jeremiah 52:7
.
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. -- jeremiah 52:8
.
Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. -- jeremiah 52:9
.
The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah in Riblah. -- jeremiah 52:10
.
Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death. -- jeremiah 52:11
.
Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 52:12
.
He burned the house of the LORD, the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire. -- jeremiah 52:13
.
So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 52:14
.
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the artisans. -- jeremiah 52:15
.
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen. -- jeremiah 52:16
.
Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the LORD and the stands and the bronze sea, which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon. -- jeremiah 52:17
.
They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service. -- jeremiah 52:18
.
The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans and the drink offering bowls, what was fine gold and what was fine silver. -- jeremiah 52:19
.
The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD--the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight. -- jeremiah 52:20
.
As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness, and hollow. -- jeremiah 52:21
.
Now a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of each capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates. -- jeremiah 52:22
.
There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates numbered a hundred on the network all around. -- jeremiah 52:23
.
Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple. -- jeremiah 52:24
.
He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the men of war, and seven of the king's advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. -- jeremiah 52:25
.
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. -- jeremiah 52:26
.
Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land. -- jeremiah 52:27
.
These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away into exile: in the seventh year 3,Jews; -- jeremiah 52:28
.
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar persons from Jerusalem; -- jeremiah 52:29
.
in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile Jewish people; there were 4,600 persons in all. -- jeremiah 52:30
.
Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. -- jeremiah 52:31
.
Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon. -- jeremiah 52:32
.
So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king's presence regularly all the days of his life. -- jeremiah 52:33
.
For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death. -- jeremiah 52:34
.
How lonely sits the city That was full of people! She has become like a widow Who was once great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces Has become a forced laborer! -- lamentations 1:1
.
She weeps bitterly in the night And her tears are on her cheeks; She has none to comfort her Among all her lovers. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies. -- lamentations 1:2
.
Judah has gone into exile under affliction And under harsh servitude; She dwells among the nations, But she has found no rest; All her pursuers have overtaken her In the midst of distress. -- lamentations 1:3
.
The roads of Zion are in mourning Because no one comes to the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate; Her priests are groaning, Her virgins are afflicted, And she herself is bitter. -- lamentations 1:4
.
Her adversaries have become her masters, Her enemies prosper; For the LORD has caused her grief Because of the multitude of her transgressions; Her little ones have gone away As captives before the adversary. -- lamentations 1:5
.
All her majesty Has departed from the daughter of Zion; Her princes have become like deer That have found no pasture; And they have fled without strength Before the pursuer. -- lamentations 1:6
.
In the days of her affliction and homelessness Jerusalem remembers all her precious things That were from the days of old, When her people fell into the hand of the adversary And no one helped her. The adversaries saw her, They mocked at her ruin. -- lamentations 1:7
.
Jerusalem sinned greatly, Therefore she has become an unclean thing. All who honored her despise her Because they have seen her nakedness; Even she herself groans and turns away. -- lamentations 1:8
.
Her uncleanness was in her skirts; She did not consider her future. Therefore she has fallen astonishingly; She has no comforter. "See, O LORD, my affliction, For the enemy has magnified himself!" -- lamentations 1:9
.
The adversary has stretched out his hand Over all her precious things, For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, The ones whom You commanded That they should not enter into Your congregation. -- lamentations 1:10
.
All her people groan seeking bread; They have given their precious things for food To restore their lives themselves. "See, O LORD, and look, For I am despised." -- lamentations 1:11
.
"Is it nothing to all you who pass this way? Look and see if there is any pain like my pain Which was severely dealt out to me, Which the LORD inflicted on the day of His fierce anger. -- lamentations 1:12
.
"From on high He sent fire into my bones, And it prevailed over them. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me desolate, Faint all day long. -- lamentations 1:13
.
"The yoke of my transgressions is bound; By His hand they are knit together. They have come upon my neck; He has made my strength fail. The Lord has given me into the hands Of those against whom I am not able to stand. -- lamentations 1:14
.
"The Lord has rejected all my strong men In my midst; He has called an appointed time against me To crush my young men; The Lord has trodden as in a wine press The virgin daughter of Judah. -- lamentations 1:15
.
"For these things I weep; My eyes run down with water; Because far from me is a comforter, One who restores my soul. My children are desolate Because the enemy has prevailed." -- lamentations 1:16
.
Zion stretches out her hands; There is no one to comfort her; The LORD has commanded concerning Jacob That the ones round about him should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them. -- lamentations 1:17
.
"The LORD is righteous; For I have rebelled against His command; Hear now, all peoples, And behold my pain; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity. -- lamentations 1:18
.
"I called to my lovers, but they deceived me; My priests and my elders perished in the city While they sought food to restore their strength themselves. -- lamentations 1:19
.
"See, O LORD, for I am in distress; My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword slays; In the house it is like death. -- lamentations 1:20
.
"They have heard that I groan; There is no one to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my calamity; They are glad that You have done it. Oh, that You would bring the day which You have proclaimed, That they may become like me. -- lamentations 1:21
.
"Let all their wickedness come before You; And deal with them as You have dealt with me For all my transgressions; For my groans are many and my heart is faint." -- lamentations 1:22
.
How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion With a cloud in His anger! He has cast from heaven to earth The glory of Israel, And has not remembered His footstool In the day of His anger. -- lamentations 2:1
.
The Lord has swallowed up; He has not spared All the habitations of Jacob. In His wrath He has thrown down The strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes. -- lamentations 2:2
.
In fierce anger He has cut off All the strength of Israel; He has drawn back His right hand From before the enemy. And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire Consuming round about. -- lamentations 2:3
.
He has bent His bow like an enemy; He has set His right hand like an adversary And slain all that were pleasant to the eye; In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire. -- lamentations 2:4
.
The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all its palaces, He has destroyed its strongholds And multiplied in the daughter of Judah Mourning and moaning. -- lamentations 2:5
.
And He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden booth; He has destroyed His appointed meeting place. The LORD has caused to be forgotten The appointed feast and sabbath in Zion, And He has despised king and priest In the indignation of His anger. -- lamentations 2:6
.
The Lord has rejected His altar, He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has delivered into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces. They have made a noise in the house of the LORD As in the day of an appointed feast. -- lamentations 2:7
.
The LORD determined to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line, He has not restrained His hand from destroying, And He has caused rampart and wall to lament; They have languished together. -- lamentations 2:8
.
Her gates have sunk into the ground, He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations; The law is no more. Also, her prophets find No vision from the LORD. -- lamentations 2:9
.
The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground, they are silent. They have thrown dust on their heads; They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Have bowed their heads to the ground. -- lamentations 2:10
.
My eyes fail because of tears, My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is poured out on the earth Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, When little ones and infants faint In the streets of the city. -- lamentations 2:11
.
They say to their mothers, "Where is grain and wine?" As they faint like a wounded man In the streets of the city, As their life is poured out On their mothers' bosom. -- lamentations 2:12
.
How shall I admonish you? To what shall I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I liken you as I comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is as vast as the sea; Who can heal you? -- lamentations 2:13
.
Your prophets have seen for you False and foolish visions; And they have not exposed your iniquity So as to restore you from captivity, But they have seen for you false and misleading oracles. -- lamentations 2:14
.
All who pass along the way Clap their hands in derision at you; They hiss and shake their heads At the daughter of Jerusalem, "Is this the city of which they said, 'The perfection of beauty, A joy to all the earth'?" -- lamentations 2:15
.
All your enemies Have opened their mouths wide against you; They hiss and gnash their teeth. They say, "We have swallowed her up! Surely this is the day for which we waited; We have reached it, we have seen it." -- lamentations 2:16
.
The LORD has done what He purposed; He has accomplished His word Which He commanded from days of old. He has thrown down without sparing, And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; He has exalted the might of your adversaries. -- lamentations 2:17
.
Their heart cried out to the Lord, "O wall of the daughter of Zion, Let your tears run down like a river day and night; Give yourself no relief, Let your eyes have no rest. -- lamentations 2:18
.
"Arise, cry aloud in the night At the beginning of the night watches; Pour out your heart like water Before the presence of the Lord; Lift up your hands to Him For the life of your little ones Who are faint because of hunger At the head of every street." -- lamentations 2:19
.
See, O LORD, and look! With whom have You dealt thus? Should women eat their offspring, The little ones who were born healthy? Should priest and prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord? -- lamentations 2:20
.
On the ground in the streets Lie young and old; My virgins and my young men Have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of Your anger, You have slaughtered, not sparing. -- lamentations 2:21
.
You called as in the day of an appointed feast My terrors on every side; And there was no one who escaped or survived In the day of the LORD'S anger. Those whom I bore and reared, My enemy annihilated them. -- lamentations 2:22
.
I am the man who has seen affliction Because of the rod of His wrath. -- lamentations 3:1
.
He has driven me and made me walk In darkness and not in light. -- lamentations 3:2
.
Surely against me He has turned His hand Repeatedly all the day. -- lamentations 3:3
.
He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away, He has broken my bones. -- lamentations 3:4
.
He has besieged and encompassed me with bitterness and hardship. -- lamentations 3:5
.
In dark places He has made me dwell, Like those who have long been dead. -- lamentations 3:6
.
He has walled me in so that I cannot go out; He has made my chain heavy. -- lamentations 3:7
.
Even when I cry out and call for help, He shuts out my prayer. -- lamentations 3:8
.
He has blocked my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked. -- lamentations 3:9
.
He is to me like a bear lying in wait, Like a lion in secret places. -- lamentations 3:10
.
He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces; He has made me desolate. -- lamentations 3:11
.
He bent His bow And set me as a target for the arrow. -- lamentations 3:12
.
He made the arrows of His quiver To enter into my inward parts. -- lamentations 3:13
.
I have become a laughingstock to all my people, Their mocking song all the day. -- lamentations 3:14
.
He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with wormwood. -- lamentations 3:15
.
He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has made me cower in the dust. -- lamentations 3:16
.
My soul has been rejected from peace; I have forgotten happiness. -- lamentations 3:17
.
So I say, "My strength has perished, And so has my hope from the LORD." -- lamentations 3:18
.
Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness. -- lamentations 3:19
.
Surely my soul remembers And is bowed down within me. -- lamentations 3:20
.
This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. -- lamentations 3:21
.
The LORD'S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail. -- lamentations 3:22
.
They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness. -- lamentations 3:23
.
"The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I have hope in Him." -- lamentations 3:24
.
The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, To the person who seeks Him. -- lamentations 3:25
.
It is good that he waits silently For the salvation of the LORD. -- lamentations 3:26
.
It is good for a man that he should bear The yoke in his youth. -- lamentations 3:27
.
Let him sit alone and be silent Since He has laid it on him. -- lamentations 3:28
.
Let him put his mouth in the dust, Perhaps there is hope. -- lamentations 3:29
.
Let him give his cheek to the smiter, Let him be filled with reproach. -- lamentations 3:30
.
For the Lord will not reject forever, -- lamentations 3:31
.
For if He causes grief, Then He will have compassion According to His abundant lovingkindness. -- lamentations 3:32
.
For He does not afflict willingly Or grieve the sons of men. -- lamentations 3:33
.
To crush under His feet All the prisoners of the land, -- lamentations 3:34
.
To deprive a man of justice In the presence of the Most High, -- lamentations 3:35
.
To defraud a man in his lawsuit-- Of these things the Lord does not approve. -- lamentations 3:36
.
Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass, Unless the Lord has commanded it? -- lamentations 3:37
.
Is it not from the mouth of the Most High That both good and ill go forth? -- lamentations 3:38
.
Why should any living mortal, or any man, Offer complaint in view of his sins? -- lamentations 3:39
.
Let us examine and probe our ways, And let us return to the LORD. -- lamentations 3:40
.
We lift up our heart and hands Toward God in heaven; -- lamentations 3:41
.
We have transgressed and rebelled, You have not pardoned. -- lamentations 3:42
.
You have covered Yourself with anger And pursued us; You have slain and have not spared. -- lamentations 3:43
.
You have covered Yourself with a cloud So that no prayer can pass through. -- lamentations 3:44
.
You have made us mere offscouring and refuse In the midst of the peoples. -- lamentations 3:45
.
All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. -- lamentations 3:46
.
Panic and pitfall have befallen us, Devastation and destruction; -- lamentations 3:47
.
My eyes run down with streams of water Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. -- lamentations 3:48
.
My eyes pour down unceasingly, Without stopping, -- lamentations 3:49
.
Until the LORD looks down And sees from heaven. -- lamentations 3:50
.
My eyes bring pain to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city. -- lamentations 3:51
.
My enemies without cause Hunted me down like a bird; -- lamentations 3:52
.
They have silenced me in the pit And have placed a stone on me. -- lamentations 3:53
.
Waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am cut off!" -- lamentations 3:54
.
I called on Your name, O LORD, Out of the lowest pit. -- lamentations 3:55
.
You have heard my voice, "Do not hide Your ear from my prayer for relief, From my cry for help." -- lamentations 3:56
.
You drew near when I called on You; You said, "Do not fear!" -- lamentations 3:57
.
O Lord, You have pleaded my soul's cause; You have redeemed my life. -- lamentations 3:58
.
O LORD, You have seen my oppression; Judge my case. -- lamentations 3:59
.
You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me. -- lamentations 3:60
.
You have heard their reproach, O LORD, All their schemes against me. -- lamentations 3:61
.
The lips of my assailants and their whispering Are against me all day long. -- lamentations 3:62
.
Look on their sitting and their rising; I am their mocking song. -- lamentations 3:63
.
You will recompense them, O LORD, According to the work of their hands. -- lamentations 3:64
.
You will give them hardness of heart, Your curse will be on them. -- lamentations 3:65
.
You will pursue them in anger and destroy them From under the heavens of the LORD! -- lamentations 3:66
.
How dark the gold has become, How the pure gold has changed! The sacred stones are poured out At the corner of every street. -- lamentations 4:1
.
The precious sons of Zion, Weighed against fine gold, How they are regarded as earthen jars, The work of a potter's hands! -- lamentations 4:2
.
Even jackals offer the breast, They nurse their young; But the daughter of my people has become cruel Like ostriches in the wilderness. -- lamentations 4:3
.
The tongue of the infant cleaves To the roof of its mouth because of thirst; The little ones ask for bread, But no one breaks it for them. -- lamentations 4:4
.
Those who ate delicacies Are desolate in the streets; Those reared in purple Embrace ash pits. -- lamentations 4:5
.
For the iniquity of the daughter of my people Is greater than the sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown as in a moment, And no hands were turned toward her. -- lamentations 4:6
.
Her consecrated ones were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than corals, Their polishing was like lapis lazuli. -- lamentations 4:7
.
Their appearance is blacker than soot, They are not recognized in the streets; Their skin is shriveled on their bones, It is withered, it has become like wood. -- lamentations 4:8
.
Better are those slain with the sword Than those slain with hunger; For they pine away, being stricken For lack of the fruits of the field. -- lamentations 4:9
.
The hands of compassionate women Boiled their own children; They became food for them Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. -- lamentations 4:10
.
The LORD has accomplished His wrath, He has poured out His fierce anger; And He has kindled a fire in Zion Which has consumed its foundations. -- lamentations 4:11
.
The kings of the earth did not believe, Nor did any of the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy Could enter the gates of Jerusalem. -- lamentations 4:12
.
Because of the sins of her prophets And the iniquities of her priests, Who have shed in her midst The blood of the righteous; -- lamentations 4:13
.
They wandered, blind, in the streets; They were defiled with blood So that no one could touch their garments. -- lamentations 4:14
.
"Depart! Unclean!" they cried of themselves. "Depart, depart, do not touch!" So they fled and wandered; Men among the nations said, "They shall not continue to dwell with us." -- lamentations 4:15
.
The presence of the LORD has scattered them, He will not continue to regard them; They did not honor the priests, They did not favor the elders. -- lamentations 4:16
.
Yet our eyes failed, Looking for help was useless; In our watching we have watched For a nation that could not save. -- lamentations 4:17
.
They hunted our steps So that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, Our days were finished For our end had come. -- lamentations 4:18
.
Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the sky; They chased us on the mountains, They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness. -- lamentations 4:19
.
The breath of our nostrils, the LORD'S anointed, Was captured in their pits, Of whom we had said, "Under his shadow We shall live among the nations." -- lamentations 4:20
.
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, Who dwells in the land of Uz; But the cup will come around to you as well, You will become drunk and make yourself naked. -- lamentations 4:21
.
The punishment of your iniquity has been completed, O daughter of Zion; He will exile you no longer. But He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins! -- lamentations 4:22
.
Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; Look, and see our reproach! -- lamentations 5:1
.
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, Our houses to aliens. -- lamentations 5:2
.
We have become orphans without a father, Our mothers are like widows. -- lamentations 5:3
.
We have to pay for our drinking water, Our wood comes to us at a price. -- lamentations 5:4
.
Our pursuers are at our necks; We are worn out, there is no rest for us. -- lamentations 5:5
.
We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread. -- lamentations 5:6
.
Our fathers sinned, and are no more; It is we who have borne their iniquities. -- lamentations 5:7
.
Slaves rule over us; There is no one to deliver us from their hand. -- lamentations 5:8
.
We get our bread at the risk of our lives Because of the sword in the wilderness. -- lamentations 5:9
.
Our skin has become as hot as an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine. -- lamentations 5:10
.
They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah. -- lamentations 5:11
.
Princes were hung by their hands; Elders were not respected. -- lamentations 5:12
.
Young men worked at the grinding mill, And youths stumbled under loads of wood. -- lamentations 5:13
.
Elders are gone from the gate, Young men from their music. -- lamentations 5:14
.
The joy of our hearts has ceased; Our dancing has been turned into mourning. -- lamentations 5:15
.
The crown has fallen from our head; Woe to us, for we have sinned! -- lamentations 5:16
.
Because of this our heart is faint, Because of these things our eyes are dim; -- lamentations 5:17
.
Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate, Foxes prowl in it. -- lamentations 5:18
.
You, O LORD, rule forever; Your throne is from generation to generation. -- lamentations 5:19
.
Why do You forget us forever? Why do You forsake us so long? -- lamentations 5:20
.
Restore us to You, O LORD, that we may be restored; Renew our days as of old, -- lamentations 5:21
.
Unless You have utterly rejected us And are exceedingly angry with us. -- lamentations 5:22
.
Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. -- ezekiel 1:1
.
(On the fifth of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile, -- ezekiel 1:2
.
the word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and there the hand of the LORD came upon him.) -- ezekiel 1:3
.
As I looked, behold, a storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire. -- ezekiel 1:4
.
Within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form. -- ezekiel 1:5
.
Each of them had four faces and four wings. -- ezekiel 1:6
.
Their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf's hoof, and they gleamed like burnished bronze. -- ezekiel 1:7
.
Under their wings on their four sides were human hands. As for the faces and wings of the four of them, -- ezekiel 1:8
.
their wings touched one another; their faces did not turn when they moved, each went straight forward. -- ezekiel 1:9
.
As for the form of their faces, each had the face of a man; all four had the face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left, and all four had the face of an eagle. -- ezekiel 1:10
.
Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another being, and two covering their bodies. -- ezekiel 1:11
.
And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went. -- ezekiel 1:12
.
In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches darting back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire. -- ezekiel 1:13
.
And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning. -- ezekiel 1:14
.
Now as I looked at the living beings, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living beings, for each of the four of them. -- ezekiel 1:15
.
The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like sparkling beryl, and all four of them had the same form, their appearance and workmanship being as if one wheel were within another. -- ezekiel 1:16
.
Whenever they moved, they moved in any of their four directions without turning as they moved. -- ezekiel 1:17
.
As for their rims they were lofty and awesome, and the rims of all four of them were full of eyes round about. -- ezekiel 1:18
.
Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. And whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also. -- ezekiel 1:19
.
Wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go in that direction. And the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. -- ezekiel 1:20
.
Whenever those went, these went; and whenever those stood still, these stood still. And whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. -- ezekiel 1:21
.
Now over the heads of the living beings there was something like an expanse, like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads. -- ezekiel 1:22
.
Under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward the other; each one also had two wings covering its body on the one side and on the other. -- ezekiel 1:23
.
I also heard the sound of their wings like the sound of abundant waters as they went, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army camp; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings. -- ezekiel 1:24
.
And there came a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings. -- ezekiel 1:25
.
Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man. -- ezekiel 1:26
.
Then I noticed from the appearance of His loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw something like fire; and there was a radiance around Him. -- ezekiel 1:27
.
As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking. -- ezekiel 1:28
.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!" -- ezekiel 2:1
.
As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me. -- ezekiel 2:2
.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day. -- ezekiel 2:3
.
"I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' -- ezekiel 2:4
.
"As for them, whether they listen or not--for they are a rebellious house--they will know that a prophet has been among them. -- ezekiel 2:5
.
"And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house. -- ezekiel 2:6
.
"But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious. -- ezekiel 2:7
.
"Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you." -- ezekiel 2:8
.
Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me; and lo, a scroll was in it. -- ezekiel 2:9
.
When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back, and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe. -- ezekiel 2:10
.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel." -- ezekiel 3:1
.
So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll. -- ezekiel 3:2
.
He said to me, "Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your body with this scroll which I am giving you." Then I ate it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth. -- ezekiel 3:3
.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them. -- ezekiel 3:4
.
"For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel, -- ezekiel 3:5
.
nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to them who should listen to you; -- ezekiel 3:6
.
yet the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, since they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel is stubborn and obstinate. -- ezekiel 3:7
.
"Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. -- ezekiel 3:8
.
"Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or be dismayed before them, though they are a rebellious house." -- ezekiel 3:9
.
Moreover, He said to me, "Son of man, take into your heart all My words which I will speak to you and listen closely. -- ezekiel 3:10
.
"Go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'" -- ezekiel 3:11
.
Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me, "Blessed be the glory of the LORD in His place." -- ezekiel 3:12
.
And I heard the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another and the sound of the wheels beside them, even a great rumbling sound. -- ezekiel 3:13
.
So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went embittered in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong on me. -- ezekiel 3:14
.
Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the river Chebar at Tel-abib, and I sat there seven days where they were living, causing consternation among them. -- ezekiel 3:15
.
At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 3:16
.
"Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman to the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me. -- ezekiel 3:17
.
"When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. -- ezekiel 3:18
.
"Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself. -- ezekiel 3:19
.
"Again, when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. -- ezekiel 3:20
.
"However, if you have warned the righteous man that the righteous should not sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; and you have delivered yourself." -- ezekiel 3:21
.
The hand of the LORD was on me there, and He said to me, "Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you." -- ezekiel 3:22
.
So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face. -- ezekiel 3:23
.
The Spirit then entered me and made me stand on my feet, and He spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself up in your house. -- ezekiel 3:24
.
"As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them. -- ezekiel 3:25
.
"Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and cannot be a man who rebukes them, for they are a rebellious house. -- ezekiel 3:26
.
"But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you will say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house. -- ezekiel 3:27
.
"Now you son of man, get yourself a brick, place it before you and inscribe a city on it, Jerusalem. -- ezekiel 4:1
.
"Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, raise up a ramp, pitch camps and place battering rams against it all around. -- ezekiel 4:2
.
"Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel. -- ezekiel 4:3
.
"As for you, lie down on your left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; you shall bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on it. -- ezekiel 4:4
.
"For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their iniquity, three hundred and ninety days; thus you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. -- ezekiel 4:5
.
"When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; I have assigned it to you for forty days, a day for each year. -- ezekiel 4:6
.
"Then you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it. -- ezekiel 4:7
.
"Now behold, I will put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege. -- ezekiel 4:8
.
"But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet and spelt, put them in one vessel and make them into bread for yourself; you shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days. -- ezekiel 4:9
.
"Your food which you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; you shall eat it from time to time. -- ezekiel 4:10
.
"The water you drink shall be the sixth part of a hin by measure; you shall drink it from time to time. -- ezekiel 4:11
.
"You shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked it in their sight over human dung." -- ezekiel 4:12
.
Then the LORD said, "Thus will the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will banish them." -- ezekiel 4:13
.
But I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never been defiled; for from my youth until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has any unclean meat ever entered my mouth." -- ezekiel 4:14
.
Then He said to me, "See, I will give you cow's dung in place of human dung over which you will prepare your bread." -- ezekiel 4:15
.
Moreover, He said to me, "Son of man, behold, I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in horror, -- ezekiel 4:16
.
because bread and water will be scarce; and they will be appalled with one another and waste away in their iniquity. -- ezekiel 4:17
.
"As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take and use it as a barber's razor on your head and beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair. -- ezekiel 5:1
.
"One third you shall burn in the fire at the center of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. Then you shall take one third and strike it with the sword all around the city, and one third you shall scatter to the wind; and I will unsheathe a sword behind them. -- ezekiel 5:2
.
"Take also a few in number from them and bind them in the edges of your robes. -- ezekiel 5:3
.
"Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire; from it a fire will spread to all the house of Israel. -- ezekiel 5:4
.
"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'This is Jerusalem; I have set her at the center of the nations, with lands around her. -- ezekiel 5:5
.
'But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations and against My statutes more than the lands which surround her; for they have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.' -- ezekiel 5:6
.
"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have more turmoil than the nations which surround you and have not walked in My statutes, nor observed My ordinances, nor observed the ordinances of the nations which surround you,' -- ezekiel 5:7
.
therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations. -- ezekiel 5:8
.
'And because of all your abominations, I will do among you what I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again. -- ezekiel 5:9
.
'Therefore, fathers will eat their sons among you, and sons will eat their fathers; for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnant to every wind. -- ezekiel 5:10
.
'So as I live,' declares the Lord GOD, 'surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also withdraw, and My eye will have no pity and I will not spare. -- ezekiel 5:11
.
'One third of you will die by plague or be consumed by famine among you, one third will fall by the sword around you, and one third I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe a sword behind them. -- ezekiel 5:12
.
'Thus My anger will be spent and I will satisfy My wrath on them, and I will be appeased; then they will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in My zeal when I have spent My wrath upon them. -- ezekiel 5:13
.
'Moreover, I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations which surround you, in the sight of all who pass by. -- ezekiel 5:14
.
'So it will be a reproach, a reviling, a warning and an object of horror to the nations who surround you when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath and raging rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken. -- ezekiel 5:15
.
'When I send against them the deadly arrows of famine which were for the destruction of those whom I will send to destroy you, then I will also intensify the famine upon you and break the staff of bread. -- ezekiel 5:16
.
'Moreover, I will send on you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave you of children; plague and bloodshed also will pass through you, and I will bring the sword on you. I, the LORD, have spoken.'" -- ezekiel 5:17
.
And the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 6:1
.
"Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them -- ezekiel 6:2
.
and say, 'Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, the hills, the ravines and the valleys: "Behold, I Myself am going to bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places. -- ezekiel 6:3
.
"So your altars will become desolate and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols. -- ezekiel 6:4
.
"I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars. -- ezekiel 6:5
.
"In all your dwellings, cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate, that your altars may become waste and desolate, your idols may be broken and brought to an end, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out. -- ezekiel 6:6
.
"The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 6:7
.
"However, I will leave a remnant, for you will have those who escaped the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the countries. -- ezekiel 6:8
.
"Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which they will be carried captive, how I have been hurt by their adulterous hearts which turned away from Me, and by their eyes which played the harlot after their idols; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their abominations. -- ezekiel 6:9
.
"Then they will know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would inflict this disaster on them."' -- ezekiel 6:10
.
"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Clap your hand, stamp your foot and say, "Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, which will fall by sword, famine and plague! -- ezekiel 6:11
.
"He who is far off will die by the plague, and he who is near will fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus will I spend My wrath on them. -- ezekiel 6:12
.
"Then you will know that I am the LORD, when their slain are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree and under every leafy oak--the places where they offered soothing aroma to all their idols. -- ezekiel 6:13
.
"So throughout all their habitations I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land more desolate and waste than the wilderness toward Diblah; thus they will know that I am the LORD."'" -- ezekiel 6:14
.
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 7:1
.
"And you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel, 'An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land. -- ezekiel 7:2
.
'Now the end is upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you. -- ezekiel 7:3
.
'For My eye will have no pity on you, nor will I spare you, but I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be among you; then you will know that I am the LORD!' -- ezekiel 7:4
.
"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'A disaster, unique disaster, behold it is coming! -- ezekiel 7:5
.
'An end is coming; the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it has come! -- ezekiel 7:6
.
'Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near--tumult rather than joyful shouting on the mountains. -- ezekiel 7:7
.
'Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and spend My anger against you; judge you according to your ways and bring on you all your abominations. -- ezekiel 7:8
.
'My eye will show no pity nor will I spare. I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst; then you will know that I, the LORD, do the smiting. -- ezekiel 7:9
.
'Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! Your doom has gone forth; the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed. -- ezekiel 7:10
.
'Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, none of their people, none of their wealth, nor anything eminent among them. -- ezekiel 7:11
.
'The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn; for wrath is against all their multitude. -- ezekiel 7:12
.
'Indeed, the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they both live; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be averted, nor will any of them maintain his life by his iniquity. -- ezekiel 7:13
.
'They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one is going to the battle, for My wrath is against all their multitude. -- ezekiel 7:14
.
'The sword is outside and the plague and the famine are within. He who is in the field will die by the sword; famine and the plague will also consume those in the city. -- ezekiel 7:15
.
'Even when their survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each over his own iniquity. -- ezekiel 7:16
.
'All hands will hang limp and all knees will become like water. -- ezekiel 7:17
.
'They will gird themselves with sackcloth and shuddering will overwhelm them; and shame will be on all faces and baldness on all their heads. -- ezekiel 7:18
.
'They will fling their silver into the streets and their gold will become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their appetite nor can they fill their stomachs, for their iniquity has become an occasion of stumbling. -- ezekiel 7:19
.
'They transformed the beauty of His ornaments into pride, and they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things with it; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them. -- ezekiel 7:20
.
'I will give it into the hands of the foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it. -- ezekiel 7:21
.
'I will also turn My face from them, and they will profane My secret place; then robbers will enter and profane it. -- ezekiel 7:22
.
'Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. -- ezekiel 7:23
.
'Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong ones cease, and their holy places will be profaned. -- ezekiel 7:24
.
'When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none. -- ezekiel 7:25
.
'Disaster will come upon disaster and rumor will be added to rumor; then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but the law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders. -- ezekiel 7:26
.
'The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with horror, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their conduct I will deal with them, and by their judgments I will judge them. And they will know that I am the LORD.'" -- ezekiel 7:27
.
It came about in the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell on me there. -- ezekiel 8:1
.
Then I looked, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of a man; from His loins and downward there was the appearance of fire, and from His loins and upward the appearance of brightness, like the appearance of glowing metal. -- ezekiel 8:2
.
He stretched out the form of a hand and caught me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the idol of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy, was located. -- ezekiel 8:3
.
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance which I saw in the plain. -- ezekiel 8:4
.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the north." So I raised my eyes toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar gate was this idol of jealousy at the entrance. -- ezekiel 8:5
.
And He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, so that I would be far from My sanctuary? But yet you will see still greater abominations." -- ezekiel 8:6
.
Then He brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. -- ezekiel 8:7
.
He said to me, "Son of man, now dig through the wall." So I dug through the wall, and behold, an entrance. -- ezekiel 8:8
.
And He said to me, "Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here." -- ezekiel 8:9
.
So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of creeping things and beasts and detestable things, with all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around. -- ezekiel 8:10
.
Standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each man with his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud of incense rising. -- ezekiel 8:11
.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are committing in the dark, each man in the room of his carved images? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.'" -- ezekiel 8:12
.
And He said to me, "Yet you will see still greater abominations which they are committing." -- ezekiel 8:13
.
Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz. -- ezekiel 8:14
.
He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these." -- ezekiel 8:15
.
Then He brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house. And behold, at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward toward the sun. -- ezekiel 8:16
.
He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they have committed here, that they have filled the land with violence and provoked Me repeatedly? For behold, they are putting the twig to their nose. -- ezekiel 8:17
.
"Therefore, I indeed will deal in wrath. My eye will have no pity nor will I spare; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, yet I will not listen to them." -- ezekiel 8:18
.
Then He cried out in my hearing with a loud voice saying, "Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand." -- ezekiel 9:1
.
Behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand; and among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case at his loins. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar. -- ezekiel 9:2
.
Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub on which it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case. -- ezekiel 9:3
.
The LORD said to him, "Go through the midst of the city, even through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations which are being committed in its midst." -- ezekiel 9:4
.
But to the others He said in my hearing, "Go through the city after him and strike; do not let your eye have pity and do not spare. -- ezekiel 9:5
.
"Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women, but do not touch any man on whom is the mark; and you shall start from My sanctuary." So they started with the elders who were before the temple. -- ezekiel 9:6
.
And He said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!" Thus they went out and struck down the people in the city. -- ezekiel 9:7
.
As they were striking the people and I alone was left, I fell on my face and cried out saying, "Alas, Lord GOD! Are You destroying the whole remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath on Jerusalem?" -- ezekiel 9:8
.
Then He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great, and the land is filled with blood and the city is full of perversion; for they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see!' -- ezekiel 9:9
.
"But as for Me, My eye will have no pity nor will I spare, but I will bring their conduct upon their heads." -- ezekiel 9:10
.
Then behold, the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case reported, saying, "I have done just as You have commanded me." -- ezekiel 9:11
.
Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne, appeared above them. -- ezekiel 10:1
.
And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, "Enter between the whirling wheels under the cherubim and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city." And he entered in my sight. -- ezekiel 10:2
.
Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner court. -- ezekiel 10:3
.
Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD. -- ezekiel 10:4
.
Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks. -- ezekiel 10:5
.
It came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he entered and stood beside a wheel. -- ezekiel 10:6
.
Then the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire which was between the cherubim, took some and put it into the hands of the one clothed in linen, who took it and went out. -- ezekiel 10:7
.
The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man's hand under their wings. -- ezekiel 10:8
.
Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a Tarshish stone. -- ezekiel 10:9
.
As for their appearance, all four of them had the same likeness, as if one wheel were within another wheel. -- ezekiel 10:10
.
When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went; but they followed in the direction which they faced, without turning as they went. -- ezekiel 10:11
.
Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around, the wheels belonging to all four of them. -- ezekiel 10:12
.
The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels. -- ezekiel 10:13
.
And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. -- ezekiel 10:14
.
Then the cherubim rose up. They are the living beings that I saw by the river Chebar. -- ezekiel 10:15
.
Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; also when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels would not turn from beside them. -- ezekiel 10:16
.
When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when they rose up, the wheels would rise with them, for the spirit of the living beings was in them. -- ezekiel 10:17
.
Then the glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim. -- ezekiel 10:18
.
When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD'S house, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them. -- ezekiel 10:19
.
These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; so I knew that they were cherubim. -- ezekiel 10:20
.
Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and beneath their wings was the form of human hands. -- ezekiel 10:21
.
As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one went straight ahead. -- ezekiel 10:22
.
Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the LORD'S house which faced eastward. And behold, there were twenty-five men at the entrance of the gate, and among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. -- ezekiel 11:1
.
He said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give evil advice in this city, -- ezekiel 11:2
.
who say, 'The time is not near to build houses. This city is the pot and we are the flesh.' -- ezekiel 11:3
.
"Therefore, prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!" -- ezekiel 11:4
.
Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and He said to me, "Say, 'Thus says the LORD, "So you think, house of Israel, for I know your thoughts. -- ezekiel 11:5
.
"You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them." -- ezekiel 11:6
.
'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of the city are the flesh and this city is the pot; but I will bring you out of it. -- ezekiel 11:7
.
"You have feared a sword; so I will bring a sword upon you," the Lord GOD declares. -- ezekiel 11:8
.
"And I will bring you out of the midst of the city and deliver you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you. -- ezekiel 11:9
.
"You will fall by the sword. I will judge you to the border of Israel; so you shall know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 11:10
.
"This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be flesh in the midst of it, but I will judge you to the border of Israel. -- ezekiel 11:11
.
"Thus you will know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in My statutes nor have you executed My ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you."'" -- ezekiel 11:12
.
Now it came about as I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, "Alas, Lord GOD! Will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?" -- ezekiel 11:13
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 11:14
.
"Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Go far from the LORD; this land has been given us as a possession.' -- ezekiel 11:15
.
"Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Though I had removed them far away among the nations and though I had scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary for them a little while in the countries where they had gone."' -- ezekiel 11:16
.
"Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries among which you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel."' -- ezekiel 11:17
.
"When they come there, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it. -- ezekiel 11:18
.
"And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them. And I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, -- ezekiel 11:19
.
that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them. Then they will be My people, and I shall be their God. -- ezekiel 11:20
.
"But as for those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down on their heads," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 11:21
.
Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them. -- ezekiel 11:22
.
The glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is east of the city. -- ezekiel 11:23
.
And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea. So the vision that I had seen left me. -- ezekiel 11:24
.
Then I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me. -- ezekiel 11:25
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 12:1
.
"Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house. -- ezekiel 12:2
.
"Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their sight; even go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house. -- ezekiel 12:3
.
"Bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you will go out at evening in their sight, as those going into exile. -- ezekiel 12:4
.
"Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it. -- ezekiel 12:5
.
"Load the baggage on your shoulder in their sight and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel." -- ezekiel 12:6
.
I did so, as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands; I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder in their sight. -- ezekiel 12:7
.
In the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 12:8
.
"Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, 'What are you doing?' -- ezekiel 12:9
.
"Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem as well as all the house of Israel who are in it."' -- ezekiel 12:10
.
"Say, 'I am a sign to you. As I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.' -- ezekiel 12:11
.
"The prince who is among them will load his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig a hole through the wall to bring it out. He will cover his face so that he can not see the land with his eyes. -- ezekiel 12:12
.
"I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. -- ezekiel 12:13
.
"I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them. -- ezekiel 12:14
.
"So they will know that I am the LORD when I scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries. -- ezekiel 12:15
.
"But I will spare a few of them from the sword, the famine and the pestilence that they may tell all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD." -- ezekiel 12:16
.
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 12:17
.
"Son of man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with quivering and anxiety. -- ezekiel 12:18
.
"Then say to the people of the land, 'Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel, "They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because their land will be stripped of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it. -- ezekiel 12:19
.
"The inhabited cities will be laid waste and the land will be a desolation. So you will know that I am the LORD."'" -- ezekiel 12:20
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 12:21
.
"Son of man, what is this proverb you people have concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The days are long and every vision fails'? -- ezekiel 12:22
.
"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will make this proverb cease so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel." But tell them, "The days draw near as well as the fulfillment of every vision. -- ezekiel 12:23
.
"For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. -- ezekiel 12:24
.
"For I the LORD will speak, and whatever word I speak will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, for in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it," declares the Lord GOD.'" -- ezekiel 12:25
.
Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 12:26
.
"Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, 'The vision that he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies of times far off.' -- ezekiel 12:27
.
"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "None of My words will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed,"'" declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 12:28
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 13:1
.
"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, 'Listen to the word of the LORD! -- ezekiel 13:2
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing. -- ezekiel 13:3
.
"O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins. -- ezekiel 13:4
.
"You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the LORD. -- ezekiel 13:5
.
"They see falsehood and lying divination who are saying, 'The LORD declares,' when the LORD has not sent them; yet they hope for the fulfillment of their word. -- ezekiel 13:6
.
"Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said, 'The LORD declares,' but it is not I who have spoken?"'" -- ezekiel 13:7
.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie, therefore behold, I am against you," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 13:8
.
"So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel, that you may know that I am the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 13:9
.
"It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying, 'Peace!' when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster it over with whitewash; -- ezekiel 13:10
.
so tell those who plaster it over with whitewash, that it will fall. A flooding rain will come, and you, O hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will break out. -- ezekiel 13:11
.
"Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, 'Where is the plaster with which you plastered it?'" -- ezekiel 13:12
.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath. There will also be in My anger a flooding rain and hailstones to consume it in wrath. -- ezekiel 13:13
.
"So I will tear down the wall which you plastered over with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation is laid bare; and when it falls, you will be consumed in its midst. And you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 13:14
.
"Thus I will spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with whitewash; and I will say to you, 'The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone, -- ezekiel 13:15
.
along with the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,' declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 13:16
.
"Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own inspiration. Prophesy against them -- ezekiel 13:17
.
and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all wrists and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down the lives of My people, but preserve the lives of others for yourselves? -- ezekiel 13:18
.
"For handfuls of barley and fragments of bread, you have profaned Me to My people to put to death some who should not die and to keep others alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies."'" -- ezekiel 13:19
.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against your magic bands by which you hunt lives there as birds and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let them go, even those lives whom you hunt as birds. -- ezekiel 13:20
.
"I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, and they will no longer be in your hands to be hunted; and you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 13:21
.
"Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief, but have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way and preserve his life, -- ezekiel 13:22
.
therefore, you women will no longer see false visions or practice divination, and I will deliver My people out of your hand. Thus you will know that I am the LORD." -- ezekiel 13:23
.
Then some elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me. -- ezekiel 14:1
.
And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 14:2
.
"Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts and have put right before their faces the stumbling block of their iniquity. Should I be consulted by them at all? -- ezekiel 14:3
.
"Therefore speak to them and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Any man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I the LORD will be brought to give him an answer in the matter in view of the multitude of his idols, -- ezekiel 14:4
.
in order to lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who are estranged from Me through all their idols."' -- ezekiel 14:5
.
"Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Repent and turn away from your idols and turn your faces away from all your abominations. -- ezekiel 14:6
.
"For anyone of the house of Israel or of the immigrants who stay in Israel who separates himself from Me, sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me for himself, I the LORD will be brought to answer him in My own person. -- ezekiel 14:7
.
"I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from among My people. So you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 14:8
.
"But if the prophet is prevailed upon to speak a word, it is I, the LORD, who have prevailed upon that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel. -- ezekiel 14:9
.
"They will bear the punishment of their iniquity; as the iniquity of the inquirer is, so the iniquity of the prophet will be, -- ezekiel 14:10
.
in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Thus they will be My people, and I shall be their God,"' declares the Lord GOD." -- ezekiel 14:11
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 14:12
.
"Son of man, if a country sins against Me by committing unfaithfulness, and I stretch out My hand against it, destroy its supply of bread, send famine against it and cut off from it both man and beast, -- ezekiel 14:13
.
even though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Job were in its midst, by their own righteousness they could only deliver themselves," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 14:14
.
"If I were to cause wild beasts to pass through the land and they depopulated it, and it became desolate so that no one would pass through it because of the beasts, -- ezekiel 14:15
.
though these three men were in its midst, as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the country would be desolate. -- ezekiel 14:16
.
"Or if I should bring a sword on that country and say, 'Let the sword pass through the country and cut off man and beast from it,' -- ezekiel 14:17
.
even though these three men were in its midst, as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters, but they alone would be delivered. -- ezekiel 14:18
.
"Or if I should send a plague against that country and pour out My wrath in blood on it to cut off man and beast from it, -- ezekiel 14:19
.
even though Noah, Daniel and Job were in its midst, as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "they could not deliver either their son or their daughter. They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness." -- ezekiel 14:20
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "How much more when I send My four severe judgments against Jerusalem: sword, famine, wild beasts and plague to cut off man and beast from it! -- ezekiel 14:21
.
"Yet, behold, survivors will be left in it who will be brought out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they are going to come forth to you and you will see their conduct and actions; then you will be comforted for the calamity which I have brought against Jerusalem for everything which I have brought upon it. -- ezekiel 14:22
.
"Then they will comfort you when you see their conduct and actions, for you will know that I have not done in vain whatever I did to it," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 14:23
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 15:1
.
"Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest? -- ezekiel 15:2
.
"Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can men take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel? -- ezekiel 15:3
.
"If it has been put into the fire for fuel, and the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle part has been charred, is it then useful for anything? -- ezekiel 15:4
.
"Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything! -- ezekiel 15:5
.
"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem; -- ezekiel 15:6
.
and I set My face against them. Though they have come out of the fire, yet the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them. -- ezekiel 15:7
.
'Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,'" declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 15:8
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 16:1
.
"Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations -- ezekiel 16:2
.
and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem, "Your origin and your birth are from the land of the Canaanite, your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. -- ezekiel 16:3
.
"As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt or even wrapped in cloths. -- ezekiel 16:4
.
"No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you. Rather you were thrown out into the open field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born. -- ezekiel 16:5
.
"When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you while you were in your blood, 'Live!' Yes, I said to you while you were in your blood, 'Live!' -- ezekiel 16:6
.
"I made you numerous like plants of the field. Then you grew up, became tall and reached the age for fine ornaments; your breasts were formed and your hair had grown. Yet you were naked and bare. -- ezekiel 16:7
.
"Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness. I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 16:8
.
"Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil. -- ezekiel 16:9
.
"I also clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk. -- ezekiel 16:10
.
"I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck. -- ezekiel 16:11
.
"I also put a ring in your nostril, earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. -- ezekiel 16:12
.
"Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was of fine linen, silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey and oil; so you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty. -- ezekiel 16:13
.
"Then your fame went forth among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My splendor which I bestowed on you," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 16:14
.
"But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, and you poured out your harlotries on every passer-by who might be willing. -- ezekiel 16:15
.
"You took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various colors and played the harlot on them, which should never come about nor happen. -- ezekiel 16:16
.
"You also took your beautiful jewels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images that you might play the harlot with them. -- ezekiel 16:17
.
"Then you took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them. -- ezekiel 16:18
.
"Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil and honey with which I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 16:19
.
"Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter? -- ezekiel 16:20
.
"You slaughtered My children and offered them up to idols by causing them to pass through the fire. -- ezekiel 16:21
.
"Besides all your abominations and harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your blood. -- ezekiel 16:22
.
"Then it came about after all your wickedness ('Woe, woe to you!' declares the Lord GOD), -- ezekiel 16:23
.
that you built yourself a shrine and made yourself a high place in every square. -- ezekiel 16:24
.
"You built yourself a high place at the top of every street and made your beauty abominable, and you spread your legs to every passer-by to multiply your harlotry. -- ezekiel 16:25
.
"You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and multiplied your harlotry to make Me angry. -- ezekiel 16:26
.
"Behold now, I have stretched out My hand against you and diminished your rations. And I delivered you up to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd conduct. -- ezekiel 16:27
.
"Moreover, you played the harlot with the Assyrians because you were not satisfied; you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied. -- ezekiel 16:28
.
"You also multiplied your harlotry with the land of merchants, Chaldea, yet even with this you were not satisfied."'" -- ezekiel 16:29
.
"How languishing is your heart," declares the Lord GOD, "while you do all these things, the actions of a bold-faced harlot. -- ezekiel 16:30
.
"When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every square, in disdaining money, you were not like a harlot. -- ezekiel 16:31
.
"You adulteress wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband! -- ezekiel 16:32
.
"Men give gifts to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers to bribe them to come to you from every direction for your harlotries. -- ezekiel 16:33
.
"Thus you are different from those women in your harlotries, in that no one plays the harlot as you do, because you give money and no money is given you; thus you are different." -- ezekiel 16:34
.
Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD. -- ezekiel 16:35
.
Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your harlotries with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your sons which you gave to idols, -- ezekiel 16:36
.
therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, even all those whom you loved and all those whom you hated. So I will gather them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them that they may see all your nakedness. -- ezekiel 16:37
.
"Thus I will judge you like women who commit adultery or shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. -- ezekiel 16:38
.
"I will also give you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip you of your clothing, take away your jewels, and will leave you naked and bare. -- ezekiel 16:39
.
"They will incite a crowd against you and they will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. -- ezekiel 16:40
.
"They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. Then I will stop you from playing the harlot, and you will also no longer pay your lovers. -- ezekiel 16:41
.
"So I will calm My fury against you and My jealousy will depart from you, and I will be pacified and angry no more. -- ezekiel 16:42
.
"Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have enraged Me by all these things, behold, I in turn will bring your conduct down on your own head," declares the Lord GOD, "so that you will not commit this lewdness on top of all your other abominations. -- ezekiel 16:43
.
"Behold, everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb concerning you, saying, 'Like mother, like daughter.' -- ezekiel 16:44
.
"You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and children. You are also the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. -- ezekiel 16:45
.
"Now your older sister is Samaria, who lives north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lives south of you, is Sodom with her daughters. -- ezekiel 16:46
.
"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they. -- ezekiel 16:47
.
"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "Sodom, your sister and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done. -- ezekiel 16:48
.
"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. -- ezekiel 16:49
.
"Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw it. -- ezekiel 16:50
.
"Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half of your sins, for you have multiplied your abominations more than they. Thus you have made your sisters appear righteous by all your abominations which you have committed. -- ezekiel 16:51
.
"Also bear your disgrace in that you have made judgment favorable for your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. Yes, be also ashamed and bear your disgrace, in that you made your sisters appear righteous. -- ezekiel 16:52
.
"Nevertheless, I will restore their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them your own captivity, -- ezekiel 16:53
.
in order that you may bear your humiliation and feel ashamed for all that you have done when you become a consolation to them. -- ezekiel 16:54
.
"Your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to their former state, and you with your daughters will also return to your former state. -- ezekiel 16:55
.
"As the name of your sister Sodom was not heard from your lips in your day of pride, -- ezekiel 16:56
.
before your wickedness was uncovered, so now you have become the reproach of the daughters of Edom and of all who are around her, of the daughters of the Philistines--those surrounding you who despise you. -- ezekiel 16:57
.
"You have borne the penalty of your lewdness and abominations," the LORD declares. -- ezekiel 16:58
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant. -- ezekiel 16:59
.
"Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. -- ezekiel 16:60
.
"Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both your older and your younger; and I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant. -- ezekiel 16:61
.
"Thus I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD, -- ezekiel 16:62
.
so that you may remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth anymore because of your humiliation, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done," the Lord GOD declares. -- ezekiel 16:63
.
Now the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 17:1
.
"Son of man, propound a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel, -- ezekiel 17:2
.
saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "A great eagle with great wings, long pinions and a full plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took away the top of the cedar. -- ezekiel 17:3
.
"He plucked off the topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a city of traders. -- ezekiel 17:4
.
"He also took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters; he set it like a willow. -- ezekiel 17:5
.
"Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine with its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and yielded shoots and sent out branches. -- ezekiel 17:6
.
"But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward him from the beds where it was planted, that he might water it. -- ezekiel 17:7
.
"It was planted in good soil beside abundant waters, that it might yield branches and bear fruit and become a splendid vine."' -- ezekiel 17:8
.
"Say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers--so that all its sprouting leaves wither? And neither by great strength nor by many people can it be raised from its roots again. -- ezekiel 17:9
.
"Behold, though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither as soon as the east wind strikes it--wither on the beds where it grew?"'" -- ezekiel 17:10
.
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 17:11
.
"Say now to the rebellious house, 'Do you not know what these things mean?' Say, 'Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and princes and brought them to him in Babylon. -- ezekiel 17:12
.
'He took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land, -- ezekiel 17:13
.
that the kingdom might be in subjection, not exalting itself, but keeping his covenant that it might continue. -- ezekiel 17:14
.
'But he rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt that they might give him horses and many troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape? -- ezekiel 17:15
.
'As I live,' declares the Lord GOD, 'Surely in the country of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, in Babylon he shall die. -- ezekiel 17:16
.
'Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in the war, when they cast up ramps and build siege walls to cut off many lives. -- ezekiel 17:17
.
'Now he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he pledged his allegiance, yet did all these things; he shall not escape.'" -- ezekiel 17:18
.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "As I live, surely My oath which he despised and My covenant which he broke, I will inflict on his head. -- ezekiel 17:19
.
"I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. Then I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there regarding the unfaithful act which he has committed against Me. -- ezekiel 17:20
.
"All the choice men in all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind; and you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken." -- ezekiel 17:21
.
Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and set it out; I will pluck from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain. -- ezekiel 17:22
.
"On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit and become a stately cedar. And birds of every kind will nest under it; they will nest in the shade of its branches. -- ezekiel 17:23
.
"All the trees of the field will know that I am the LORD; I bring down the high tree, exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will perform it." -- ezekiel 17:24
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 18:1
.
"What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The fathers eat the sour grapes, But the children's teeth are set on edge'? -- ezekiel 18:2
.
"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "you are surely not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore. -- ezekiel 18:3
.
"Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die. -- ezekiel 18:4
.
"But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness, -- ezekiel 18:5
.
and does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period-- -- ezekiel 18:6
.
if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing, -- ezekiel 18:7
.
if he does not lend money on interest or take increase, if he keeps his hand from iniquity and executes true justice between man and man, -- ezekiel 18:8
.
if he walks in My statutes and My ordinances so as to deal faithfully--he is righteous and will surely live," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 18:9
.
"Then he may have a violent son who sheds blood and who does any of these things to a brother -- ezekiel 18:10
.
(though he himself did not do any of these things), that is, he even eats at the mountain shrines, and defiles his neighbor's wife, -- ezekiel 18:11
.
oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore a pledge, but lifts up his eyes to the idols and commits abomination, -- ezekiel 18:12
.
he lends money on interest and takes increase; will he live? He will not live! He has committed all these abominations, he will surely be put to death; his blood will be on his own head. -- ezekiel 18:13
.
"Now behold, he has a son who has observed all his father's sins which he committed, and observing does not do likewise. -- ezekiel 18:14
.
"He does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's wife, -- ezekiel 18:15
.
or oppress anyone, or retain a pledge, or commit robbery, but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing, -- ezekiel 18:16
.
he keeps his hand from the poor, does not take interest or increase, but executes My ordinances, and walks in My statutes; he will not die for his father's iniquity, he will surely live. -- ezekiel 18:17
.
"As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was not good among his people, behold, he will die for his iniquity. -- ezekiel 18:18
.
"Yet you say, 'Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity?' When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed all My statutes and done them, he shall surely live. -- ezekiel 18:19
.
"The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself. -- ezekiel 18:20
.
"But if the wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die. -- ezekiel 18:21
.
"All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live. -- ezekiel 18:22
.
"Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked," declares the Lord GOD, "rather than that he should turn from his ways and live? -- ezekiel 18:23
.
"But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed; for them he will die. -- ezekiel 18:24
.
"Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' Hear now, O house of Israel! Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right? -- ezekiel 18:25
.
"When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and dies because of it, for his iniquity which he has committed he will die. -- ezekiel 18:26
.
"Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life. -- ezekiel 18:27
.
"Because he considered and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die. -- ezekiel 18:28
.
"But the house of Israel says, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' Are My ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not right? -- ezekiel 18:29
.
"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his conduct," declares the Lord GOD. "Repent and turn away from all your transgressions, so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you. -- ezekiel 18:30
.
"Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why will you die, O house of Israel? -- ezekiel 18:31
.
"For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies," declares the Lord GOD. "Therefore, repent and live." -- ezekiel 18:32
.
"As for you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel -- ezekiel 19:1
.
and say, 'What was your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions, She reared her cubs. -- ezekiel 19:2
.
'When she brought up one of her cubs, He became a lion, And he learned to tear his prey; He devoured men. -- ezekiel 19:3
.
'Then nations heard about him; He was captured in their pit, And they brought him with hooks To the land of Egypt. -- ezekiel 19:4
.
'When she saw, as she waited, That her hope was lost, She took another of her cubs And made him a young lion. -- ezekiel 19:5
.
'And he walked about among the lions; He became a young lion, He learned to tear his prey; He devoured men. -- ezekiel 19:6
.
'He destroyed their fortified towers And laid waste their cities; And the land and its fullness were appalled Because of the sound of his roaring. -- ezekiel 19:7
.
'Then nations set against him On every side from their provinces, And they spread their net over him; He was captured in their pit. -- ezekiel 19:8
.
'They put him in a cage with hooks And brought him to the king of Babylon; They brought him in hunting nets So that his voice would be heard no more On the mountains of Israel. -- ezekiel 19:9
.
'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, Planted by the waters; It was fruitful and full of branches Because of abundant waters. -- ezekiel 19:10
.
'And it had strong branches fit for scepters of rulers, And its height was raised above the clouds So that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches. -- ezekiel 19:11
.
'But it was plucked up in fury; It was cast down to the ground; And the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branch was torn off So that it withered; The fire consumed it. -- ezekiel 19:12
.
'And now it is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land. -- ezekiel 19:13
.
'And fire has gone out from its branch; It has consumed its shoots and fruit, So that there is not in it a strong branch, A scepter to rule.'" This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation. -- ezekiel 19:14
.
Now in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me. -- ezekiel 20:1
.
And the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 20:2
.
"Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Do you come to inquire of Me? As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will not be inquired of by you."' -- ezekiel 20:3
.
"Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Make them know the abominations of their fathers; -- ezekiel 20:4
.
and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day when I chose Israel and swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God, -- ezekiel 20:5
.
on that day I swore to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. -- ezekiel 20:6
.
"I said to them, 'Cast away, each of you, the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.' -- ezekiel 20:7
.
"But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; they did not cast away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. -- ezekiel 20:8
.
"But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt. -- ezekiel 20:9
.
"So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. -- ezekiel 20:10
.
"I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live. -- ezekiel 20:11
.
"Also I gave them My sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them. -- ezekiel 20:12
.
"But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes and they rejected My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; and My sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness, to annihilate them. -- ezekiel 20:13
.
"But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, before whose sight I had brought them out. -- ezekiel 20:14
.
"Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands, -- ezekiel 20:15
.
because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did not walk in them; they even profaned My sabbaths, for their heart continually went after their idols. -- ezekiel 20:16
.
"Yet My eye spared them rather than destroying them, and I did not cause their annihilation in the wilderness. -- ezekiel 20:17
.
"I said to their children in the wilderness, 'Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols. -- ezekiel 20:18
.
'I am the LORD your God; walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and observe them. -- ezekiel 20:19
.
'Sanctify My sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.' -- ezekiel 20:20
.
"But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, nor were they careful to observe My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; they profaned My sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the wilderness. -- ezekiel 20:21
.
"But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. -- ezekiel 20:22
.
"Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands, -- ezekiel 20:23
.
because they had not observed My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes and had profaned My sabbaths, and their eyes were on the idols of their fathers. -- ezekiel 20:24
.
"I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live; -- ezekiel 20:25
.
and I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts, in that they caused all their firstborn to pass through the fire so that I might make them desolate, in order that they might know that I am the LORD."' -- ezekiel 20:26
.
"Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me by acting treacherously against Me. -- ezekiel 20:27
.
"When I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There also they made their soothing aroma and there they poured out their drink offerings. -- ezekiel 20:28
.
"Then I said to them, 'What is the high place to which you go?' So its name is called Bamah to this day."' -- ezekiel 20:29
.
"Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and play the harlot after their detestable things? -- ezekiel 20:30
.
"When you offer your gifts, when you cause your sons to pass through the fire, you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will not be inquired of by you. -- ezekiel 20:31
.
"What comes into your mind will not come about, when you say: 'We will be like the nations, like the tribes of the lands, serving wood and stone.' -- ezekiel 20:32
.
"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "surely with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I shall be king over you. -- ezekiel 20:33
.
"I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out; -- ezekiel 20:34
.
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face. -- ezekiel 20:35
.
"As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 20:36
.
"I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; -- ezekiel 20:37
.
and I will purge from you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Thus you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 20:38
.
"As for you, O house of Israel," thus says the Lord GOD, "Go, serve everyone his idols; but later you will surely listen to Me, and My holy name you will profane no longer with your gifts and with your idols. -- ezekiel 20:39
.
"For on My holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel," declares the Lord GOD, "there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land; there I will accept them and there I will seek your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things. -- ezekiel 20:40
.
"As a soothing aroma I will accept you when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered; and I will prove Myself holy among you in the sight of the nations. -- ezekiel 20:41
.
"And you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land which I swore to give to your forefathers. -- ezekiel 20:42
.
"There you will remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evil things that you have done. -- ezekiel 20:43
.
"Then you will know that I am the LORD when I have dealt with you for My name's sake, not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel," declares the Lord GOD.'" -- ezekiel 20:44
.
Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 20:45
.
"Son of man, set your face toward Teman, and speak out against the south and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev, -- ezekiel 20:46
.
and say to the forest of the Negev, 'Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am about to kindle a fire in you, and it will consume every green tree in you, as well as every dry tree; the blazing flame will not be quenched and the whole surface from south to north will be burned by it. -- ezekiel 20:47
.
"All flesh will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched."'" -- ezekiel 20:48
.
Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! They are saying of me, 'Is he not just speaking parables?'" -- ezekiel 20:49
.
And the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 21:1
.
"Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and speak against the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of Israel; -- ezekiel 21:2
.
and say to the land of Israel, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am against you; and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. -- ezekiel 21:3
.
"Because I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword will go forth from its sheath against all flesh from south to north. -- ezekiel 21:4
.
"Thus all flesh will know that I, the LORD, have drawn My sword out of its sheath. It will not return to its sheath again."' -- ezekiel 21:5
.
"As for you, son of man, groan with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan in their sight. -- ezekiel 21:6
.
"And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that is coming; and every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes and it will happen,' declares the Lord GOD." -- ezekiel 21:7
.
Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 21:8
.
"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the LORD.' Say, 'A sword, a sword sharpened And also polished! -- ezekiel 21:9
.
'Sharpened to make a slaughter, Polished to flash like lightning!' Or shall we rejoice, the rod of My son despising every tree? -- ezekiel 21:10
.
"It is given to be polished, that it may be handled; the sword is sharpened and polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. -- ezekiel 21:11
.
"Cry out and wail, son of man; for it is against My people, it is against all the officials of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with My people, therefore strike your thigh. -- ezekiel 21:12
.
"For there is a testing; and what if even the rod which despises will be no more?" declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 21:13
.
"You therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword for the slain. It is the sword for the great one slain, which surrounds them, -- ezekiel 21:14
.
that their hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword. Ah! It is made for striking like lightning, it is wrapped up in readiness for slaughter. -- ezekiel 21:15
.
"Show yourself sharp, go to the right; set yourself; go to the left, wherever your edge is appointed. -- ezekiel 21:16
.
"I will also clap My hands together, and I will appease My wrath; I, the LORD, have spoken." -- ezekiel 21:17
.
The word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 21:18
.
"As for you, son of man, make two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them will go out of one land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to the city. -- ezekiel 21:19
.
"You shall mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem. -- ezekiel 21:20
.
"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver. -- ezekiel 21:21
.
"Into his right hand came the divination, 'Jerusalem,' to set battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift up the voice with a battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up ramps, to build a siege wall. -- ezekiel 21:22
.
"And it will be to them like a false divination in their eyes; they have sworn solemn oaths. But he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be seized. -- ezekiel 21:23
.
"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you will be seized with the hand. -- ezekiel 21:24
.
'And you, O slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end,' -- ezekiel 21:25
.
thus says the Lord GOD, 'Remove the turban and take off the crown; this will no longer be the same. Exalt that which is low and abase that which is high. -- ezekiel 21:26
.
'A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, I will make it. This also will be no more until He comes whose right it is, and I will give it to Him.' -- ezekiel 21:27
.
"And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the sons of Ammon and concerning their reproach,' and say: 'A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for the slaughter, to cause it to consume, that it may be like lightning-- -- ezekiel 21:28
.
while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you--to place you on the necks of the wicked who are slain, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end. -- ezekiel 21:29
.
'Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. -- ezekiel 21:30
.
'I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and I will give you into the hand of brutal men, skilled in destruction. -- ezekiel 21:31
.
'You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land. You will not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.'" -- ezekiel 21:32
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 22:1
.
"And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations. -- ezekiel 22:2
.
"You shall say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "A city shedding blood in her midst, so that her time will come, and that makes idols, contrary to her interest, for defilement! -- ezekiel 22:3
.
"You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and defiled by your idols which you have made. Thus you have brought your day near and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the lands. -- ezekiel 22:4
.
"Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you of ill repute, full of turmoil. -- ezekiel 22:5
.
"Behold, the rulers of Israel, each according to his power, have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood. -- ezekiel 22:6
.
"They have treated father and mother lightly within you. The alien they have oppressed in your midst; the fatherless and the widow they have wronged in you. -- ezekiel 22:7
.
"You have despised My holy things and profaned My sabbaths. -- ezekiel 22:8
.
"Slanderous men have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood, and in you they have eaten at the mountain shrines. In your midst they have committed acts of lewdness. -- ezekiel 22:9
.
"In you they have uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her menstrual impurity. -- ezekiel 22:10
.
"One has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. And another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter. -- ezekiel 22:11
.
"In you they have taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and profits, and you have injured your neighbors for gain by oppression, and you have forgotten Me," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 22:12
.
"Behold, then, I smite My hand at your dishonest gain which you have acquired and at the bloodshed which is among you. -- ezekiel 22:13
.
"Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong in the days that I will deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken and will act. -- ezekiel 22:14
.
"I will scatter you among the nations and I will disperse you through the lands, and I will consume your uncleanness from you. -- ezekiel 22:15
.
"You will profane yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the LORD."'" -- ezekiel 22:16
.
And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 22:17
.
"Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are the dross of silver. -- ezekiel 22:18
.
"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because all of you have become dross, therefore, behold, I am going to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. -- ezekiel 22:19
.
'As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in My anger and in My wrath and I will lay you there and melt you. -- ezekiel 22:20
.
'I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it. -- ezekiel 22:21
.
'As silver is melted in the furnace, so you will be melted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out My wrath on you.'" -- ezekiel 22:22
.
And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 22:23
.
"Son of man, say to her, 'You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.' -- ezekiel 22:24
.
"There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her. -- ezekiel 22:25
.
"Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, and they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. -- ezekiel 22:26
.
"Her princes within her are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood and destroying lives in order to get dishonest gain. -- ezekiel 22:27
.
"Her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' when the LORD has not spoken. -- ezekiel 22:28
.
"The people of the land have practiced oppression and committed robbery, and they have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the sojourner without justice. -- ezekiel 22:29
.
"I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. -- ezekiel 22:30
.
"Thus I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their way I have brought upon their heads," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 22:31
.
The word of the LORD came to me again, saying, -- ezekiel 23:1
.
"Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother; -- ezekiel 23:2
.
and they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and there their virgin bosom was handled. -- ezekiel 23:3
.
"Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah and Jerusalem is Oholibah. -- ezekiel 23:4
.
"Oholah played the harlot while she was Mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, her neighbors, -- ezekiel 23:5
.
who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. -- ezekiel 23:6
.
"She bestowed her harlotries on them, all of whom were the choicest men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself. -- ezekiel 23:7
.
"She did not forsake her harlotries from the time in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her, and they handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her. -- ezekiel 23:8
.
"Therefore, I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted. -- ezekiel 23:9
.
"They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, but they slew her with the sword. Thus she became a byword among women, and they executed judgments on her. -- ezekiel 23:10
.
"Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and her harlotries were more than the harlotries of her sister. -- ezekiel 23:11
.
"She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, the ones near, magnificently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. -- ezekiel 23:12
.
"I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way. -- ezekiel 23:13
.
"So she increased her harlotries. And she saw men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, -- ezekiel 23:14
.
girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth. -- ezekiel 23:15
.
"When she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. -- ezekiel 23:16
.
"The Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and defiled her with their harlotry. And when she had been defiled by them, she became disgusted with them. -- ezekiel 23:17
.
"She uncovered her harlotries and uncovered her nakedness; then I became disgusted with her, as I had become disgusted with her sister. -- ezekiel 23:18
.
"Yet she multiplied her harlotries, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt. -- ezekiel 23:19
.
"She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses. -- ezekiel 23:20
.
"Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth. -- ezekiel 23:21
.
"Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold I will arouse your lovers against you, from whom you were alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side: -- ezekiel 23:22
.
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. -- ezekiel 23:23
.
'They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their customs. -- ezekiel 23:24
.
'I will set My jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in wrath. They will remove your nose and your ears; and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors will be consumed by the fire. -- ezekiel 23:25
.
'They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels. -- ezekiel 23:26
.
'Thus I will make your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt to cease from you, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.' -- ezekiel 23:27
.
"For thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I will give you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom you were alienated. -- ezekiel 23:28
.
'They will deal with you in hatred, take all your property, and leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your harlotries will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotries. -- ezekiel 23:29
.
'These things will be done to you because you have played the harlot with the nations, because you have defiled yourself with their idols. -- ezekiel 23:30
.
'You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.' -- ezekiel 23:31
.
"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'You will drink your sister's cup, Which is deep and wide. You will be laughed at and held in derision; It contains much. -- ezekiel 23:32
.
'You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, The cup of horror and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria. -- ezekiel 23:33
.
'You will drink it and drain it. Then you will gnaw its fragments And tear your breasts; for I have spoken,' declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 23:34
.
"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, bear now the punishment of your lewdness and your harlotries.'" -- ezekiel 23:35
.
Moreover, the LORD said to me, "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations. -- ezekiel 23:36
.
"For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. Thus they have committed adultery with their idols and even caused their sons, whom they bore to Me, to pass through the fire to them as food. -- ezekiel 23:37
.
"Again, they have done this to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My sabbaths. -- ezekiel 23:38
.
"For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and lo, thus they did within My house. -- ezekiel 23:39
.
"Furthermore, they have even sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and lo, they came--for whom you bathed, painted your eyes and decorated yourselves with ornaments; -- ezekiel 23:40
.
and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it on which you had set My incense and My oil. -- ezekiel 23:41
.
"The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort. And they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads. -- ezekiel 23:42
.
"Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, 'Will they now commit adultery with her when she is thus?' -- ezekiel 23:43
.
"But they went in to her as they would go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women. -- ezekiel 23:44
.
"But they, righteous men, will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands. -- ezekiel 23:45
.
"For thus says the Lord GOD, 'Bring up a company against them and give them over to terror and plunder. -- ezekiel 23:46
.
'The company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire. -- ezekiel 23:47
.
'Thus I will make lewdness cease from the land, that all women may be admonished and not commit lewdness as you have done. -- ezekiel 23:48
.
'Your lewdness will be requited upon you, and you will bear the penalty of worshiping your idols; thus you will know that I am the Lord GOD.'" -- ezekiel 23:49
.
And the word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, saying, -- ezekiel 24:1
.
"Son of man, write the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. -- ezekiel 24:2
.
"Speak a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Put on the pot, put it on and also pour water in it; -- ezekiel 24:3
.
Put in it the pieces, Every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; Fill it with choice bones. -- ezekiel 24:4
.
"Take the choicest of the flock, And also pile wood under the pot. Make it boil vigorously. Also seethe its bones in it." -- ezekiel 24:5
.
'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the bloody city, To the pot in which there is rust And whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, Without making a choice. -- ezekiel 24:6
.
"For her blood is in her midst; She placed it on the bare rock; She did not pour it on the ground To cover it with dust. -- ezekiel 24:7
.
"That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, That it may not be covered." -- ezekiel 24:8
.
'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great. -- ezekiel 24:9
.
"Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, Boil the flesh well And mix in the spices, And let the bones be burned. -- ezekiel 24:10
.
"Then set it empty on its coals So that it may be hot And its bronze may glow And its filthiness may be melted in it, Its rust consumed. -- ezekiel 24:11
.
"She has wearied Me with toil, Yet her great rust has not gone from her; Let her rust be in the fire! -- ezekiel 24:12
.
"In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I would have cleansed you, Yet you are not clean, You will not be cleansed from your filthiness again Until I have spent My wrath on you. -- ezekiel 24:13
.
"I, the LORD, have spoken; it is coming and I will act. I will not relent, and I will not pity and I will not be sorry; according to your ways and according to your deeds I will judge you," declares the Lord GOD.'" -- ezekiel 24:14
.
And the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 24:15
.
"Son of man, behold, I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a blow; but you shall not mourn and you shall not weep, and your tears shall not come. -- ezekiel 24:16
.
"Groan silently; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban and put your shoes on your feet, and do not cover your mustache and do not eat the bread of men." -- ezekiel 24:17
.
So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded. -- ezekiel 24:18
.
The people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things that you are doing mean for us?" -- ezekiel 24:19
.
Then I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 24:20
.
'Speak to the house of Israel, "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am about to profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes and the delight of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword. -- ezekiel 24:21
.
'You will do as I have done; you will not cover your mustache and you will not eat the bread of men. -- ezekiel 24:22
.
'Your turbans will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet. You will not mourn and you will not weep, but you will rot away in your iniquities and you will groan to one another. -- ezekiel 24:23
.
'Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done you will do; when it comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.'" -- ezekiel 24:24
.
'As for you, son of man, will it not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their pride, the desire of their eyes and their heart's delight, their sons and their daughters, -- ezekiel 24:25
.
that on that day he who escapes will come to you with information for your ears? -- ezekiel 24:26
.
'On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped, and you will speak and be mute no longer. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.'" -- ezekiel 24:27
.
And the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 25:1
.
"Son of man, set your face toward the sons of Ammon and prophesy against them, -- ezekiel 25:2
.
and say to the sons of Ammon, 'Hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you said, 'Aha!' against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile, -- ezekiel 25:3
.
therefore, behold, I am going to give you to the sons of the east for a possession, and they will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk. -- ezekiel 25:4
.
"I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the sons of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Thus you will know that I am the LORD." -- ezekiel 25:5
.
'For thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the scorn of your soul against the land of Israel, -- ezekiel 25:6
.
therefore, behold, I have stretched out My hand against you and I will give you for spoil to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands; I will destroy you. Thus you will know that I am the LORD." -- ezekiel 25:7
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because Moab and Seir say, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,' -- ezekiel 25:8
.
therefore, behold, I am going to deprive the flank of Moab of its cities, of its cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the land, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon and Kiriathaim, -- ezekiel 25:9
.
and I will give it for a possession along with the sons of Ammon to the sons of the east, so that the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations. -- ezekiel 25:10
.
"Thus I will execute judgments on Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD." -- ezekiel 25:11
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because Edom has acted against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has incurred grievous guilt, and avenged themselves upon them," -- ezekiel 25:12
.
therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off man and beast from it. And I will lay it waste; from Teman even to Dedan they will fall by the sword. -- ezekiel 25:13
.
"I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel. Therefore, they will act in Edom according to My anger and according to My wrath; thus they will know My vengeance," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 25:14
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because the Philistines have acted in revenge and have taken vengeance with scorn of soul to destroy with everlasting enmity," -- ezekiel 25:15
.
therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, even cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast. -- ezekiel 25:16
.
"I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes; and they will know that I am the LORD when I lay My vengeance on them."'" -- ezekiel 25:17
.
Now in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 26:1
.
"Son of man, because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem, 'Aha, the gateway of the peoples is broken; it has opened to me. I shall be filled, now that she is laid waste,' -- ezekiel 26:2
.
therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. -- ezekiel 26:3
.
'They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock. -- ezekiel 26:4
.
'She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,' declares the Lord GOD, 'and she will become spoil for the nations. -- ezekiel 26:5
.
'Also her daughters who are on the mainland will be slain by the sword, and they will know that I am the LORD.'" -- ezekiel 26:6
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry and a great army. -- ezekiel 26:7
.
"He will slay your daughters on the mainland with the sword; and he will make siege walls against you, cast up a ramp against you and raise up a large shield against you. -- ezekiel 26:8
.
"The blow of his battering rams he will direct against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. -- ezekiel 26:9
.
"Because of the multitude of his horses, the dust raised by them will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of cavalry and wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city that is breached. -- ezekiel 26:10
.
"With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will slay your people with the sword; and your strong pillars will come down to the ground. -- ezekiel 26:11
.
"Also they will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise, break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses, and throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water. -- ezekiel 26:12
.
"So I will silence the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will be heard no more. -- ezekiel 26:13
.
"I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more, for I the LORD have spoken," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 26:14
.
Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre, "Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan, when the slaughter occurs in your midst? -- ezekiel 26:15
.
"Then all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones, remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment and be appalled at you. -- ezekiel 26:16
.
"They will take up a lamentation over you and say to you, 'How you have perished, O inhabited one, From the seas, O renowned city, Which was mighty on the sea, She and her inhabitants, Who imposed her terror On all her inhabitants! -- ezekiel 26:17
.
'Now the coastlands will tremble On the day of your fall; Yes, the coastlands which are by the sea Will be terrified at your passing.'" -- ezekiel 26:18
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "When I make you a desolate city, like the cities which are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you and the great waters cover you, -- ezekiel 26:19
.
then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited; but I will set glory in the land of the living. -- ezekiel 26:20
.
"I will bring terrors on you and you will be no more; though you will be sought, you will never be found again," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 26:21
.
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 27:1
.
"And you, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre; -- ezekiel 27:2
.
and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrance to the sea, merchant of the peoples to many coastlands, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "O Tyre, you have said, 'I am perfect in beauty.' -- ezekiel 27:3
.
"Your borders are in the heart of the seas; Your builders have perfected your beauty. -- ezekiel 27:4
.
"They have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. -- ezekiel 27:5
.
"Of oaks from Bashan they have made your oars; With ivory they have inlaid your deck of boxwood from the coastlands of Cyprus. -- ezekiel 27:6
.
"Your sail was of fine embroidered linen from Egypt So that it became your distinguishing mark; Your awning was blue and purple from the coastlands of Elishah. -- ezekiel 27:7
.
"The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; Your wise men, O Tyre, were aboard; they were your pilots. -- ezekiel 27:8
.
"The elders of Gebal and her wise men were with you repairing your seams; All the ships of the sea and their sailors were with you in order to deal in your merchandise. -- ezekiel 27:9
.
"Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, your men of war. They hung shield and helmet in you; they set forth your splendor. -- ezekiel 27:10
.
"The sons of Arvad and your army were on your walls, all around, and the Gammadim were in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around; they perfected your beauty. -- ezekiel 27:11
.
"Tarshish was your customer because of the abundance of all kinds of wealth; with silver, iron, tin and lead they paid for your wares. -- ezekiel 27:12
.
"Javan, Tubal and Meshech, they were your traders; with the lives of men and vessels of bronze they paid for your merchandise. -- ezekiel 27:13
.
"Those from Beth-togarmah gave horses and war horses and mules for your wares. -- ezekiel 27:14
.
"The sons of Dedan were your traders. Many coastlands were your market; ivory tusks and ebony they brought as your payment. -- ezekiel 27:15
.
"Aram was your customer because of the abundance of your goods; they paid for your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral and rubies. -- ezekiel 27:16
.
"Judah and the land of Israel, they were your traders; with the wheat of Minnith, cakes, honey, oil and balm they paid for your merchandise. -- ezekiel 27:17
.
"Damascus was your customer because of the abundance of your goods, because of the abundance of all kinds of wealth, because of the wine of Helbon and white wool. -- ezekiel 27:18
.
"Vedan and Javan paid for your wares from Uzal; wrought iron, cassia and sweet cane were among your merchandise. -- ezekiel 27:19
.
"Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. -- ezekiel 27:20
.
"Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they were your customers for lambs, rams and goats; for these they were your customers. -- ezekiel 27:21
.
"The traders of Sheba and Raamah, they traded with you; they paid for your wares with the best of all kinds of spices, and with all kinds of precious stones and gold. -- ezekiel 27:22
.
"Haran, Canneh, Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad traded with you. -- ezekiel 27:23
.
"They traded with you in choice garments, in clothes of blue and embroidered work, and in carpets of many colors and tightly wound cords, which were among your merchandise. -- ezekiel 27:24
.
"The ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your merchandise. And you were filled and were very glorious In the heart of the seas. -- ezekiel 27:25
.
"Your rowers have brought you Into great waters; The east wind has broken you In the heart of the seas. -- ezekiel 27:26
.
"Your wealth, your wares, your merchandise, Your sailors and your pilots, Your repairers of seams, your dealers in merchandise And all your men of war who are in you, With all your company that is in your midst, Will fall into the heart of the seas On the day of your overthrow. -- ezekiel 27:27
.
"At the sound of the cry of your pilots The pasture lands will shake. -- ezekiel 27:28
.
"All who handle the oar, The sailors and all the pilots of the sea Will come down from their ships; They will stand on the land, -- ezekiel 27:29
.
And they will make their voice heard over you And will cry bitterly. They will cast dust on their heads, They will wallow in ashes. -- ezekiel 27:30
.
"Also they will make themselves bald for you And gird themselves with sackcloth; And they will weep for you in bitterness of soul With bitter mourning. -- ezekiel 27:31
.
"Moreover, in their wailing they will take up a lamentation for you And lament over you: 'Who is like Tyre, Like her who is silent in the midst of the sea? -- ezekiel 27:32
.
'When your wares went out from the seas, You satisfied many peoples; With the abundance of your wealth and your merchandise You enriched the kings of earth. -- ezekiel 27:33
.
'Now that you are broken by the seas In the depths of the waters, Your merchandise and all your company Have fallen in the midst of you. -- ezekiel 27:34
.
'All the inhabitants of the coastlands Are appalled at you, And their kings are horribly afraid; They are troubled in countenance. -- ezekiel 27:35
.
'The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; You have become terrified And you will cease to be forever.'"'" -- ezekiel 27:36
.
The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, -- ezekiel 28:1
.
"Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because your heart is lifted up And you have said, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of gods In the heart of the seas'; Yet you are a man and not God, Although you make your heart like the heart of God-- -- ezekiel 28:2
.
Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; There is no secret that is a match for you. -- ezekiel 28:3
.
"By your wisdom and understanding You have acquired riches for yourself And have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries. -- ezekiel 28:4
.
"By your great wisdom, by your trade You have increased your riches And your heart is lifted up because of your riches-- -- ezekiel 28:5
.
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have made your heart Like the heart of God, -- ezekiel 28:6
.
Therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon you, The most ruthless of the nations. And they will draw their swords Against the beauty of your wisdom And defile your splendor. -- ezekiel 28:7
.
'They will bring you down to the pit, And you will die the death of those who are slain In the heart of the seas. -- ezekiel 28:8
.
'Will you still say, "I am a god," In the presence of your slayer, Though you are a man and not God, In the hands of those who wound you? -- ezekiel 28:9
.
'You will die the death of the uncircumcised By the hand of strangers, For I have spoken!' declares the Lord GOD!"'" -- ezekiel 28:10
.
Again the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 28:11
.
"Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "You had the seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. -- ezekiel 28:12
.
"You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every precious stone was your covering: The ruby, the topaz and the diamond; The beryl, the onyx and the jasper; The lapis lazuli, the turquoise and the emerald; And the gold, the workmanship of your settings and sockets, Was in you. On the day that you were created They were prepared. -- ezekiel 28:13
.
"You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire. -- ezekiel 28:14
.
"You were blameless in your ways From the day you were created Until unrighteousness was found in you. -- ezekiel 28:15
.
"By the abundance of your trade You were internally filled with violence, And you sinned; Therefore I have cast you as profane From the mountain of God. And I have destroyed you, O covering cherub, From the midst of the stones of fire. -- ezekiel 28:16
.
"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I put you before kings, That they may see you. -- ezekiel 28:17
.
"By the multitude of your iniquities, In the unrighteousness of your trade You profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I have brought fire from the midst of you; It has consumed you, And I have turned you to ashes on the earth In the eyes of all who see you. -- ezekiel 28:18
.
"All who know you among the peoples Are appalled at you; You have become terrified And you will cease to be forever."'" -- ezekiel 28:19
.
And the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 28:20
.
"Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, prophesy against her -- ezekiel 28:21
.
and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, And I will be glorified in your midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her, And I will manifest My holiness in her. -- ezekiel 28:22
.
"For I will send pestilence to her And blood to her streets, And the wounded will fall in her midst By the sword upon her on every side; Then they will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 28:23
.
"And there will be no more for the house of Israel a prickling brier or a painful thorn from any round about them who scorned them; then they will know that I am the Lord GOD." -- ezekiel 28:24
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and will manifest My holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they will live in their land which I gave to My servant Jacob. -- ezekiel 28:25
.
"They will live in it securely; and they will build houses, plant vineyards and live securely when I execute judgments upon all who scorn them round about them. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God."'" -- ezekiel 28:26
.
In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 29:1
.
"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. -- ezekiel 29:2
.
"Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, The great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, That has said, 'My Nile is mine, and I myself have made it.' -- ezekiel 29:3
.
"I will put hooks in your jaws And make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales. And I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, And all the fish of your rivers will cling to your scales. -- ezekiel 29:4
.
"I will abandon you to the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers; You will fall on the open field; you will not be brought together or gathered. I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky. -- ezekiel 29:5
.
"Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the LORD, Because they have been only a staff made of reed to the house of Israel. -- ezekiel 29:6
.
"When they took hold of you with the hand, You broke and tore all their hands; And when they leaned on you, You broke and made all their loins quake." -- ezekiel 29:7
.
'Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will bring upon you a sword and I will cut off from you man and beast. -- ezekiel 29:8
.
"The land of Egypt will become a desolation and waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD. Because you said, 'The Nile is mine, and I have made it,' -- ezekiel 29:9
.
therefore, behold, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia. -- ezekiel 29:10
.
"A man's foot will not pass through it, and the foot of a beast will not pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years. -- ezekiel 29:11
.
"So I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated lands. And her cities, in the midst of cities that are laid waste, will be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands." -- ezekiel 29:12
.
'For thus says the Lord GOD, "At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered. -- ezekiel 29:13
.
"I will turn the fortunes of Egypt and make them return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom. -- ezekiel 29:14
.
"It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will never again lift itself up above the nations. And I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations. -- ezekiel 29:15
.
"And it will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to mind the iniquity of their having turned to Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD."'" -- ezekiel 29:16
.
Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 29:17
.
"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare. But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it." -- ezekiel 29:18
.
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her wealth and capture her spoil and seize her plunder; and it will be wages for his army. -- ezekiel 29:19
.
"I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor which he performed, because they acted for Me," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 29:20
.
"On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth in their midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD." -- ezekiel 29:21
.
The word of the LORD came again to me saying, -- ezekiel 30:1
.
"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Wail, 'Alas for the day!' -- ezekiel 30:2
.
"For the day is near, Even the day of the LORD is near; It will be a day of clouds, A time of doom for the nations. -- ezekiel 30:3
.
"A sword will come upon Egypt, And anguish will be in Ethiopia; When the slain fall in Egypt, They take away her wealth, And her foundations are torn down. -- ezekiel 30:4
.
"Ethiopia, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya and the people of the land that is in league will fall with them by the sword." -- ezekiel 30:5
.
'Thus says the LORD, "Indeed, those who support Egypt will fall And the pride of her power will come down; From Migdol to Syene They will fall within her by the sword," Declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 30:6
.
"They will be desolate In the midst of the desolated lands; And her cities will be In the midst of the devastated cities. -- ezekiel 30:7
.
"And they will know that I am the LORD, When I set a fire in Egypt And all her helpers are broken. -- ezekiel 30:8
.
"On that day messengers will go forth from Me in ships to frighten secure Ethiopia; and anguish will be on them as on the day of Egypt; for behold, it comes!" -- ezekiel 30:9
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also make the hordes of Egypt cease By the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. -- ezekiel 30:10
.
"He and his people with him, The most ruthless of the nations, Will be brought in to destroy the land; And they will draw their swords against Egypt And fill the land with the slain. -- ezekiel 30:11
.
"Moreover, I will make the Nile canals dry And sell the land into the hands of evil men. And I will make the land desolate And all that is in it, By the hand of strangers; I the LORD have spoken." -- ezekiel 30:12
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also destroy the idols And make the images cease from Memphis. And there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt; And I will put fear in the land of Egypt. -- ezekiel 30:13
.
"I will make Pathros desolate, Set a fire in Zoan And execute judgments on Thebes. -- ezekiel 30:14
.
"I will pour out My wrath on Sin, The stronghold of Egypt; I will also cut off the hordes of Thebes. -- ezekiel 30:15
.
"I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin will writhe in anguish, Thebes will be breached And Memphis will have distresses daily. -- ezekiel 30:16
.
"The young men of On and of Pi-beseth Will fall by the sword, And the women will go into captivity. -- ezekiel 30:17
.
"In Tehaphnehes the day will be dark When I break there the yoke bars of Egypt. Then the pride of her power will cease in her; A cloud will cover her, And her daughters will go into captivity. -- ezekiel 30:18
.
"Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt, And they will know that I am the LORD."'" -- ezekiel 30:19
.
In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 30:20
.
"Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage, that it may be strong to hold the sword. -- ezekiel 30:21
.
"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, both the strong and the broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand. -- ezekiel 30:22
.
'I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands. -- ezekiel 30:23
.
'For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he will groan before him with the groanings of a wounded man. -- ezekiel 30:24
.
'Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt. -- ezekiel 30:25
.
'When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands, then they will know that I am the LORD.'" -- ezekiel 30:26
.
In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 31:1
.
"Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes, 'Whom are you like in your greatness? -- ezekiel 31:2
.
'Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon With beautiful branches and forest shade, And very high, And its top was among the clouds. -- ezekiel 31:3
.
'The waters made it grow, the deep made it high. With its rivers it continually extended all around its planting place, And sent out its channels to all the trees of the field. -- ezekiel 31:4
.
'Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field And its boughs became many and its branches long Because of many waters as it spread them out. -- ezekiel 31:5
.
'All the birds of the heavens nested in its boughs, And under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth, And all great nations lived under its shade. -- ezekiel 31:6
.
'So it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; For its roots extended to many waters. -- ezekiel 31:7
.
'The cedars in God's garden could not match it; The cypresses could not compare with its boughs, And the plane trees could not match its branches. No tree in God's garden could compare with it in its beauty. -- ezekiel 31:8
.
'I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches, And all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God, were jealous of it. -- ezekiel 31:9
.
'Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Because it is high in stature and has set its top among the clouds, and its heart is haughty in its loftiness, -- ezekiel 31:10
.
therefore I will give it into the hand of a despot of the nations; he will thoroughly deal with it. According to its wickedness I have driven it away. -- ezekiel 31:11
.
"Alien tyrants of the nations have cut it down and left it; on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land. And all the peoples of the earth have gone down from its shade and left it. -- ezekiel 31:12
.
"On its ruin all the birds of the heavens will dwell, and all the beasts of the field will be on its fallen branches -- ezekiel 31:13
.
so that all the trees by the waters may not be exalted in their stature, nor set their top among the clouds, nor their well-watered mighty ones stand erect in their height. For they have all been given over to death, to the earth beneath, among the sons of men, with those who go down to the pit." -- ezekiel 31:14
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day when it went down to Sheol I caused lamentations; I closed the deep over it and held back its rivers. And its many waters were stopped up, and I made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted away on account of it. -- ezekiel 31:15
.
"I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I made it go down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit; and all the well-watered trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, were comforted in the earth beneath. -- ezekiel 31:16
.
"They also went down with it to Sheol to those who were slain by the sword; and those who were its strength lived under its shade among the nations. -- ezekiel 31:17
.
"To which among the trees of Eden are you thus equal in glory and greatness? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth beneath; you will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. So is Pharaoh and all his hordes!"' declares the Lord GOD." -- ezekiel 31:18
.
In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 32:1
.
"Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him, 'You compared yourself to a young lion of the nations, Yet you are like the monster in the seas; And you burst forth in your rivers And muddied the waters with your feet And fouled their rivers.'" -- ezekiel 32:2
.
Thus says the Lord GOD, "Now I will spread My net over you With a company of many peoples, And they shall lift you up in My net. -- ezekiel 32:3
.
"I will leave you on the land; I will cast you on the open field. And I will cause all the birds of the heavens to dwell on you, And I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with you. -- ezekiel 32:4
.
"I will lay your flesh on the mountains And fill the valleys with your refuse. -- ezekiel 32:5
.
"I will also make the land drink the discharge of your blood As far as the mountains, And the ravines will be full of you. -- ezekiel 32:6
.
"And when I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud And the moon will not give its light. -- ezekiel 32:7
.
"All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you And will set darkness on your land," Declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 32:8
.
"I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring your destruction among the nations, into lands which you have not known. -- ezekiel 32:9
.
"I will make many peoples appalled at you, and their kings will be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they will tremble every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of your fall." -- ezekiel 32:10
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you. -- ezekiel 32:11
.
"By the swords of the mighty ones I will cause your hordes to fall; all of them are tyrants of the nations, And they will devastate the pride of Egypt, And all its hordes will be destroyed. -- ezekiel 32:12
.
"I will also destroy all its cattle from beside many waters; And the foot of man will not muddy them anymore And the hoofs of beasts will not muddy them. -- ezekiel 32:13
.
"Then I will make their waters settle And will cause their rivers to run like oil," Declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 32:14
.
"When I make the land of Egypt a desolation, And the land is destitute of that which filled it, When I smite all those who live in it, Then they shall know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 32:15
.
"This is a lamentation and they shall chant it. The daughters of the nations shall chant it. Over Egypt and over all her hordes they shall chant it," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 32:16
.
In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 32:17
.
"Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and bring it down, her and the daughters of the powerful nations, to the nether world, with those who go down to the pit; -- ezekiel 32:18
.
'Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and make your bed with the uncircumcised.' -- ezekiel 32:19
.
"They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is given over to the sword; they have drawn her and all her hordes away. -- ezekiel 32:20
.
"The strong among the mighty ones shall speak of him and his helpers from the midst of Sheol, 'They have gone down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.' -- ezekiel 32:21
.
"Assyria is there and all her company; her graves are round about her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, -- ezekiel 32:22
.
whose graves are set in the remotest parts of the pit and her company is round about her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living. -- ezekiel 32:23
.
"Elam is there and all her hordes around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who instilled their terror in the land of the living and bore their disgrace with those who went down to the pit. -- ezekiel 32:24
.
"They have made a bed for her among the slain with all her hordes. Her graves are around it, they are all uncircumcised, slain by the sword (although their terror was instilled in the land of the living), and they bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit; they were put in the midst of the slain. -- ezekiel 32:25
.
"Meshech, Tubal and all their hordes are there; their graves surround them. All of them were slain by the sword uncircumcised, though they instilled their terror in the land of the living. -- ezekiel 32:26
.
"Nor do they lie beside the fallen heroes of the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war and whose swords were laid under their heads; but the punishment for their iniquity rested on their bones, though the terror of these heroes was once in the land of the living. -- ezekiel 32:27
.
"But in the midst of the uncircumcised you will be broken and lie with those slain by the sword. -- ezekiel 32:28
.
"There also is Edom, its kings and all its princes, who for all their might are laid with those slain by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised and with those who go down to the pit. -- ezekiel 32:29
.
"There also are the chiefs of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who in spite of the terror resulting from their might, in shame went down with the slain. So they lay down uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit. -- ezekiel 32:30
.
"These Pharaoh will see, and he will be comforted for all his hordes slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his army," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 32:31
.
"Though I instilled a terror of him in the land of the living, yet he will be made to lie down among the uncircumcised along with those slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his hordes," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 32:32
.
And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- ezekiel 33:1
.
"Son of man, speak to the sons of your people and say to them, 'If I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him their watchman, -- ezekiel 33:2
.
and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows on the trumpet and warns the people, -- ezekiel 33:3
.
then he who hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, and a sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. -- ezekiel 33:4
.
'He heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning; his blood will be on himself. But had he taken warning, he would have delivered his life. -- ezekiel 33:5
.
'But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned, and a sword comes and takes a person from them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require from the watchman's hand.' -- ezekiel 33:6
.
"Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them warning from Me. -- ezekiel 33:7
.
"When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. -- ezekiel 33:8
.
"But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life. -- ezekiel 33:9
.
"Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus you have spoken, saying, "Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we are rotting away in them; how then can we survive?"' -- ezekiel 33:10
.
"Say to them, 'As I live!' declares the Lord GOD, 'I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! Why then will you die, O house of Israel?' -- ezekiel 33:11
.
"And you, son of man, say to your fellow citizens, 'The righteousness of a righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not stumble because of it in the day when he turns from his wickedness; whereas a righteous man will not be able to live by his righteousness on the day when he commits sin.' -- ezekiel 33:12
.
"When I say to the righteous he will surely live, and he so trusts in his righteousness that he commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but in that same iniquity of his which he has committed he will die. -- ezekiel 33:13
.
"But when I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and he turns from his sin and practices justice and righteousness, -- ezekiel 33:14
.
if a wicked man restores a pledge, pays back what he has taken by robbery, walks by the statutes which ensure life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die. -- ezekiel 33:15
.
"None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has practiced justice and righteousness; he shall surely live. -- ezekiel 33:16
.
"Yet your fellow citizens say, 'The way of the Lord is not right,' when it is their own way that is not right. -- ezekiel 33:17
.
"When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, then he shall die in it. -- ezekiel 33:18
.
"But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and practices justice and righteousness, he will live by them. -- ezekiel 33:19
.
"Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways." -- ezekiel 33:20
.
Now in the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth of the tenth month, the refugees from Jerusalem came to me, saying, "The city has been taken." -- ezekiel 33:21
.
Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me in the evening, before the refugees came. And He opened my mouth at the time they came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened and I was no longer speechless. -- ezekiel 33:22
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 33:23
.
"Son of man, they who live in these waste places in the land of Israel are saying, 'Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land; so to us who are many the land has been given as a possession.' -- ezekiel 33:24
.
"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "You eat meat with the blood in it, lift up your eyes to your idols as you shed blood. Should you then possess the land? -- ezekiel 33:25
.
"You rely on your sword, you commit abominations and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you then possess the land?"' -- ezekiel 33:26
.
"Thus you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of pestilence. -- ezekiel 33:27
.
"I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of her power will cease; and the mountains of Israel will be desolate so that no one will pass through. -- ezekiel 33:28
.
"Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I make the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed."' -- ezekiel 33:29
.
"But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, speak to one another, each to his brother, saying, 'Come now and hear what the message is which comes forth from the LORD.' -- ezekiel 33:30
.
"They come to you as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words, but they do not do them, for they do the lustful desires expressed by their mouth, and their heart goes after their gain. -- ezekiel 33:31
.
"Behold, you are to them like a sensual song by one who has a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument; for they hear your words but they do not practice them. -- ezekiel 33:32
.
"So when it comes to pass--as surely it will--then they will know that a prophet has been in their midst." -- ezekiel 33:33
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 34:1
.
"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock? -- ezekiel 34:2
.
"You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock. -- ezekiel 34:3
.
"Those who are sickly you have not strengthened, the diseased you have not healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought for the lost; but with force and with severity you have dominated them. -- ezekiel 34:4
.
"They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered. -- ezekiel 34:5
.
"My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill; My flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth, and there was no one to search or seek for them."'" -- ezekiel 34:6
.
Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: -- ezekiel 34:7
.
"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "surely because My flock has become a prey, My flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field for lack of a shepherd, and My shepherds did not search for My flock, but rather the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock; -- ezekiel 34:8
.
therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: -- ezekiel 34:9
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand My sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep. So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I will deliver My flock from their mouth, so that they will not be food for them."'" -- ezekiel 34:10
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out. -- ezekiel 34:11
.
"As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will care for My sheep and will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day. -- ezekiel 34:12
.
"I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land. -- ezekiel 34:13
.
"I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down on good grazing ground and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. -- ezekiel 34:14
.
"I will feed My flock and I will lead them to rest," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 34:15
.
"I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken and strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with judgment. -- ezekiel 34:16
.
"As for you, My flock, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I will judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the male goats. -- ezekiel 34:17
.
'Is it too slight a thing for you that you should feed in the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures? Or that you should drink of the clear waters, that you must foul the rest with your feet? -- ezekiel 34:18
.
'As for My flock, they must eat what you tread down with your feet and drink what you foul with your feet!'" -- ezekiel 34:19
.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them, "Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. -- ezekiel 34:20
.
"Because you push with side and with shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns until you have scattered them abroad, -- ezekiel 34:21
.
therefore, I will deliver My flock, and they will no longer be a prey; and I will judge between one sheep and another. -- ezekiel 34:22
.
"Then I will set over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd. -- ezekiel 34:23
.
"And I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be prince among them; I the LORD have spoken. -- ezekiel 34:24
.
"I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate harmful beasts from the land so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods. -- ezekiel 34:25
.
"I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. And I will cause showers to come down in their season; they will be showers of blessing. -- ezekiel 34:26
.
"Also the tree of the field will yield its fruit and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure on their land. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and have delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them. -- ezekiel 34:27
.
"They will no longer be a prey to the nations, and the beasts of the earth will not devour them; but they will live securely, and no one will make them afraid. -- ezekiel 34:28
.
"I will establish for them a renowned planting place, and they will not again be victims of famine in the land, and they will not endure the insults of the nations anymore. -- ezekiel 34:29
.
"Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 34:30
.
"As for you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are men, and I am your God," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 34:31
.
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 35:1
.
"Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it -- ezekiel 35:2
.
and say to it, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, And I will stretch out My hand against you And make you a desolation and a waste. -- ezekiel 35:3
.
"I will lay waste your cities And you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 35:4
.
"Because you have had everlasting enmity and have delivered the sons of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of the punishment of the end, -- ezekiel 35:5
.
therefore as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will give you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you; since you have not hated bloodshed, therefore bloodshed will pursue you. -- ezekiel 35:6
.
"I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation and I will cut off from it the one who passes through and returns. -- ezekiel 35:7
.
"I will fill its mountains with its slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain by the sword will fall. -- ezekiel 35:8
.
"I will make you an everlasting desolation and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 35:9
.
"Because you have said, 'These two nations and these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them,' although the LORD was there, -- ezekiel 35:10
.
therefore as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy which you showed because of your hatred against them; so I will make Myself known among them when I judge you. -- ezekiel 35:11
.
"Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel saying, 'They are laid desolate; they are given to us for food.' -- ezekiel 35:12
.
"And you have spoken arrogantly against Me and have multiplied your words against Me; I have heard it." -- ezekiel 35:13
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "As all the earth rejoices, I will make you a desolation. -- ezekiel 35:14
.
"As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be a desolation, O Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD."' -- ezekiel 35:15
.
"And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, 'O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD. -- ezekiel 36:1
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because the enemy has spoken against you, 'Aha!' and, 'The everlasting heights have become our possession,' -- ezekiel 36:2
.
therefore prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "For good reason they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side, that you would become a possession of the rest of the nations and you have been taken up in the talk and the whispering of the people."'" -- ezekiel 36:3
.
'Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the forsaken cities which have become a prey and a derision to the rest of the nations which are round about, -- ezekiel 36:4
.
therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Surely in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who appropriated My land for themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and with scorn of soul, to drive it out for a prey." -- ezekiel 36:5
.
'Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you have endured the insults of the nations.' -- ezekiel 36:6
.
"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'I have sworn that surely the nations which are around you will themselves endure their insults. -- ezekiel 36:7
.
'But you, O mountains of Israel, you will put forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel; for they will soon come. -- ezekiel 36:8
.
'For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you will be cultivated and sown. -- ezekiel 36:9
.
'I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities will be inhabited and the waste places will be rebuilt. -- ezekiel 36:10
.
'I will multiply on you man and beast; and they will increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as you were formerly and will treat you better than at the first. Thus you will know that I am the LORD. -- ezekiel 36:11
.
'Yes, I will cause men--My people Israel--to walk on you and possess you, so that you will become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.' -- ezekiel 36:12
.
"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because they say to you, "You are a devourer of men and have bereaved your nation of children," -- ezekiel 36:13
.
therefore you will no longer devour men and no longer bereave your nation of children,' declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 36:14
.
"I will not let you hear insults from the nations anymore, nor will you bear disgrace from the peoples any longer, nor will you cause your nation to stumble any longer," declares the Lord GOD.'" -- ezekiel 36:15
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 36:16
.
"Son of man, when the house of Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds; their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. -- ezekiel 36:17
.
"Therefore I poured out My wrath on them for the blood which they had shed on the land, because they had defiled it with their idols. -- ezekiel 36:18
.
"Also I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed throughout the lands. According to their ways and their deeds I judged them. -- ezekiel 36:19
.
"When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, 'These are the people of the LORD; yet they have come out of His land.' -- ezekiel 36:20
.
"But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went. -- ezekiel 36:21
.
"Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went. -- ezekiel 36:22
.
"I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD," declares the Lord GOD, "when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight. -- ezekiel 36:23
.
"For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land. -- ezekiel 36:24
.
"Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. -- ezekiel 36:25
.
"Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. -- ezekiel 36:26
.
"I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances. -- ezekiel 36:27
.
"You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God. -- ezekiel 36:28
.
"Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness; and I will call for the grain and multiply it, and I will not bring a famine on you. -- ezekiel 36:29
.
"I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that you will not receive again the disgrace of famine among the nations. -- ezekiel 36:30
.
"Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and your abominations. -- ezekiel 36:31
.
"I am not doing this for your sake," declares the Lord GOD, "let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!" -- ezekiel 36:32
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt. -- ezekiel 36:33
.
"The desolate land will be cultivated instead of being a desolation in the sight of everyone who passes by. -- ezekiel 36:34
.
"They will say, 'This desolate land has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.' -- ezekiel 36:35
.
"Then the nations that are left round about you will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted that which was desolate; I, the LORD, have spoken and will do it." -- ezekiel 36:36
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "This also I will let the house of Israel ask Me to do for them: I will increase their men like a flock. -- ezekiel 36:37
.
"Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am the LORD."'" -- ezekiel 36:38
.
The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones. -- ezekiel 37:1
.
He caused me to pass among them round about, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley; and lo, they were very dry. -- ezekiel 37:2
.
He said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "O Lord GOD, You know." -- ezekiel 37:3
.
Again He said to me, "Prophesy over these bones and say to them, 'O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.' -- ezekiel 37:4
.
"Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones, 'Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life. -- ezekiel 37:5
.
'I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come alive; and you will know that I am the LORD.'" -- ezekiel 37:6
.
So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. -- ezekiel 37:7
.
And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them. -- ezekiel 37:8
.
Then He said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they come to life."'" -- ezekiel 37:9
.
So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army. -- ezekiel 37:10
.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.' -- ezekiel 37:11
.
"Therefore prophesy and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. -- ezekiel 37:12
.
"Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people. -- ezekiel 37:13
.
"I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it," declares the LORD.'" -- ezekiel 37:14
.
The word of the LORD came again to me saying, -- ezekiel 37:15
.
"And you, son of man, take for yourself one stick and write on it, 'For Judah and for the sons of Israel, his companions'; then take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions.' -- ezekiel 37:16
.
"Then join them for yourself one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. -- ezekiel 37:17
.
"When the sons of your people speak to you saying, 'Will you not declare to us what you mean by these?' -- ezekiel 37:18
.
say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand."' -- ezekiel 37:19
.
"The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes. -- ezekiel 37:20
.
"Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land; -- ezekiel 37:21
.
and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king for all of them; and they will no longer be two nations and no longer be divided into two kingdoms. -- ezekiel 37:22
.
"They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God. -- ezekiel 37:23
.
"My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My ordinances and keep My statutes and observe them. -- ezekiel 37:24
.
"They will live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons' sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince forever. -- ezekiel 37:25
.
"I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever. -- ezekiel 37:26
.
"My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. -- ezekiel 37:27
.
"And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever."'" -- ezekiel 37:28
.
And the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- ezekiel 38:1
.
"Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him -- ezekiel 38:2
.
and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal. -- ezekiel 38:3
.
"I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them splendidly attired, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them wielding swords; -- ezekiel 38:4
.
Persia, Ethiopia and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet; -- ezekiel 38:5
.
Gomer with all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops--many peoples with you. -- ezekiel 38:6
.
"Be prepared, and prepare yourself, you and all your companies that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them. -- ezekiel 38:7
.
"After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come into the land that is restored from the sword, whose inhabitants have been gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel which had been a continual waste; but its people were brought out from the nations, and they are living securely, all of them. -- ezekiel 38:8
.
"You will go up, you will come like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you." -- ezekiel 38:9
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "It will come about on that day, that thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil plan, -- ezekiel 38:10
.
and you will say, 'I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will go against those who are at rest, that live securely, all of them living without walls and having no bars or gates, -- ezekiel 38:11
.
to capture spoil and to seize plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places which are now inhabited, and against the people who are gathered from the nations, who have acquired cattle and goods, who live at the center of the world.' -- ezekiel 38:12
.
"Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will say to you, 'Have you come to capture spoil? Have you assembled your company to seize plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to capture great spoil?'"' -- ezekiel 38:13
.
"Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On that day when My people Israel are living securely, will you not know it? -- ezekiel 38:14
.
"You will come from your place out of the remote parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army; -- ezekiel 38:15
.
and you will come up against My people Israel like a cloud to cover the land. It shall come about in the last days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I am sanctified through you before their eyes, O Gog." -- ezekiel 38:16
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days through My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring you against them? -- ezekiel 38:17

"In My zeal and in My blazing wrath I declare that on that day there will surely be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. -- ezekiel 38:19
.
"The fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all the creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men who are on the face of the earth will shake at My presence; the mountains also will be thrown down, the steep pathways will collapse and every wall will fall to the ground. -- ezekiel 38:20
.
"I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains," declares the Lord GOD. "Every man's sword will be against his brother. -- ezekiel 38:21
.
"With pestilence and with blood I will enter into judgment with him; and I will rain on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him, a torrential rain, with hailstones, fire and brimstone. -- ezekiel 38:22

"Behold, it is coming and it shall be done," declares the Lord GOD. "That is the day of which I have spoken. -- ezekiel 39:8
.
"Then those who inhabit the cities of Israel will go out and make fires with the weapons and burn them, both shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, war clubs and spears, and for seven years they will make fires of them. -- ezekiel 39:9
.
"They will not take wood from the field or gather firewood from the forests, for they will make fires with the weapons; and they will take the spoil of those who despoiled them and seize the plunder of those who plundered them," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 39:10
.
"On that day I will give Gog a burial ground there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea, and it will block off those who would pass by. So they will bury Gog there with all his horde, and they will call it the valley of Hamon-gog. -- ezekiel 39:11
.
"For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land. -- ezekiel 39:12
.
"Even all the people of the land will bury them; and it will be to their renown on the day that I glorify Myself," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 39:13
.
"They will set apart men who will constantly pass through the land, burying those who were passing through, even those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search. -- ezekiel 39:14
.
"As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a man's bone, then he will set up a marker by it until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. -- ezekiel 39:15
.
"And even the name of the city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the land."' -- ezekiel 39:16
.
"As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Speak to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field, "Assemble and come, gather from every side to My sacrifice which I am going to sacrifice for you, as a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood. -- ezekiel 39:17
.
"You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, as though they were rams, lambs, goats and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. -- ezekiel 39:18
.
"So you will eat fat until you are glutted, and drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. -- ezekiel 39:19
.
"You will be glutted at My table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all the men of war," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 39:20

"The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity because they acted treacherously against Me, and I hid My face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and all of them fell by the sword. -- ezekiel 39:23
.
"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I dealt with them, and I hid My face from them."'" -- ezekiel 39:24

"They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated against Me, when they live securely on their own land with no one to make them afraid. -- ezekiel 39:26

"When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then I shall be sanctified through them in the sight of the many nations. -- ezekiel 39:27
.
"Then they will know that I am the LORD their God because I made them go into exile among the nations, and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer. -- ezekiel 39:28

.
In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was taken, on that same day the hand of the LORD was upon me and He brought me there. -- ezekiel 40:1
.
In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, and on it to the south there was a structure like a city. -- ezekiel 40:2
.
So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway. -- ezekiel 40:3
.
The man said to me, "Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, and give attention to all that I am going to show you; for you have been brought here in order to show it to you. Declare to the house of Israel all that you see." -- ezekiel 40:4
.
And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the temple all around, and in the man's hand was a measuring rod of six cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one rod; and the height, one rod. -- ezekiel 40:5
.
Then he went to the gate which faced east, went up its steps and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in width; and the other threshold was one rod in width. -- ezekiel 40:6
.
The guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; and there were five cubits between the guardrooms. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward was one rod. -- ezekiel 40:7
.
Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward, one rod. -- ezekiel 40:8
.
He measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its side pillars, two cubits. And the porch of the gate was faced inward. -- ezekiel 40:9
.
The guardrooms of the gate toward the east numbered three on each side; the three of them had the same measurement. The side pillars also had the same measurement on each side. -- ezekiel 40:10
.
And he measured the width of the gateway, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. -- ezekiel 40:11
.
There was a barrier wall one cubit wide in front of the guardrooms on each side; and the guardrooms were six cubits square on each side. -- ezekiel 40:12
.
He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits from one door to the door opposite. -- ezekiel 40:13
.
He made the side pillars sixty cubits high; the gate extended round about to the side pillar of the courtyard. -- ezekiel 40:14
.
From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was fifty cubits. -- ezekiel 40:15
.
There were shuttered windows looking toward the guardrooms, and toward their side pillars within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. And there were windows all around inside; and on each side pillar were palm tree ornaments. -- ezekiel 40:16
.
Then he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there were chambers and a pavement made for the court all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement. -- ezekiel 40:17
.
The pavement (that is, the lower pavement) was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. -- ezekiel 40:18
.
Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east and on the north. -- ezekiel 40:19
.
As for the gate of the outer court which faced the north, he measured its length and its width. -- ezekiel 40:20
.
It had three guardrooms on each side; and its side pillars and its porches had the same measurement as the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. -- ezekiel 40:21
.
Its windows and its porches and its palm tree ornaments had the same measurements as the gate which faced toward the east; and it was reached by seven steps, and its porch was in front of them. -- ezekiel 40:22
.
The inner court had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well as the gate on the east; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate. -- ezekiel 40:23
.
Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to those same measurements. -- ezekiel 40:24
.
The gate and its porches had windows all around like those other windows; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. -- ezekiel 40:25
.
There were seven steps going up to it, and its porches were in front of them; and it had palm tree ornaments on its side pillars, one on each side. -- ezekiel 40:26
.
The inner court had a gate toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits. -- ezekiel 40:27
.
Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements. -- ezekiel 40:28
.
Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. -- ezekiel 40:29
.
There were porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide. -- ezekiel 40:30
.
Its porches were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps. -- ezekiel 40:31
.
He brought me into the inner court toward the east. And he measured the gate according to those same measurements. -- ezekiel 40:32
.
Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. -- ezekiel 40:33
.
Its porches were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway had eight steps. -- ezekiel 40:34
.
Then he brought me to the north gate; and he measured it according to those same measurements, -- ezekiel 40:35
.
with its guardrooms, its side pillars and its porches. And the gate had windows all around; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. -- ezekiel 40:36
.
Its side pillars were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars on each side, and its stairway had eight steps. -- ezekiel 40:37
.
A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering. -- ezekiel 40:38
.
In the porch of the gate were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering. -- ezekiel 40:39
.
On the outer side, as one went up to the gateway toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables. -- ezekiel 40:40
.
Four tables were on each side next to the gate; or, eight tables on which they slaughter sacrifices. -- ezekiel 40:41
.
For the burnt offering there were four tables of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and one cubit high, on which they lay the instruments with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice. -- ezekiel 40:42
.
The double hooks, one handbreadth in length, were installed in the house all around; and on the tables was the flesh of the offering. -- ezekiel 40:43
.
From the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, one of which was at the side of the north gate, with its front toward the south, and one at the side of the south gate facing toward the north. -- ezekiel 40:44
.
He said to me, "This is the chamber which faces toward the south, intended for the priests who keep charge of the temple; -- ezekiel 40:45
.
but the chamber which faces toward the north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the LORD to minister to Him." -- ezekiel 40:46
.
He measured the court, a perfect square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the temple. -- ezekiel 40:47
.
Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured each side pillar of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side. -- ezekiel 40:48
.
The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits; and at the stairway by which it was ascended were columns belonging to the side pillars, one on each side. -- ezekiel 40:49
.
Then he brought me to the nave and measured the side pillars; six cubits wide on each side was the width of the side pillar. -- ezekiel 41:1
.
The width of the entrance was ten cubits and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits. -- ezekiel 41:2
.
Then he went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway, two cubits, and the doorway, six cubits high; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits. -- ezekiel 41:3
.
He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the nave; and he said to me, "This is the most holy place." -- ezekiel 41:4
.
Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits; and the width of the side chambers, four cubits, all around about the house on every side. -- ezekiel 41:5
.
The side chambers were in three stories, one above another, and thirty in each story; and the side chambers extended to the wall which stood on their inward side all around, that they might be fastened, and not be fastened into the wall of the temple itself. -- ezekiel 41:6
.
The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the temple went upward by stages on all sides of the temple, therefore the width of the temple increased as it went higher; and thus one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the second story. -- ezekiel 41:7
.
I saw also that the house had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six long cubits in height. -- ezekiel 41:8
.
The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. But the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple -- ezekiel 41:9
.
and the outer chambers was twenty cubits in width all around the temple on every side. -- ezekiel 41:10
.
The doorways of the side chambers toward the free space consisted of one doorway toward the north and another doorway toward the south; and the width of the free space was five cubits all around. -- ezekiel 41:11
.
The building that was in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits. -- ezekiel 41:12
.
Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; the separate area with the building and its walls were also a hundred cubits long. -- ezekiel 41:13
.
Also the width of the front of the temple and that of the separate areas along the east side totaled a hundred cubits. -- ezekiel 41:14
.
He measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, a hundred cubits; he also measured the inner nave and the porches of the court. -- ezekiel 41:15
.
The thresholds, the latticed windows and the galleries round about their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered), -- ezekiel 41:16
.
over the entrance, and to the inner house, and on the outside, and on all the wall all around inside and outside, by measurement. -- ezekiel 41:17
.
It was carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces, -- ezekiel 41:18
.
a man's face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion's face toward the palm tree on the other side; they were carved on all the house all around. -- ezekiel 41:19
.
From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved, as well as on the wall of the nave. -- ezekiel 41:20
.
The doorposts of the nave were square; as for the front of the sanctuary, the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other. -- ezekiel 41:21
.
The altar was of wood, three cubits high and its length two cubits; its corners, its base and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD." -- ezekiel 41:22
.
The nave and the sanctuary each had a double door. -- ezekiel 41:23
.
Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other. -- ezekiel 41:24
.
Also there were carved on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the front of the porch outside. -- ezekiel 41:25
.
There were latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; thus were the side chambers of the house and the thresholds. -- ezekiel 41:26
.
Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the chamber which was opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north. -- ezekiel 42:1
.
Along the length, which was a hundred cubits, was the north door; the width was fifty cubits. -- ezekiel 42:2
.
Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery corresponding to gallery in three stories. -- ezekiel 42:3
.
Before the chambers was an inner walk ten cubits wide, a way of one hundred cubits; and their openings were on the north. -- ezekiel 42:4
.
Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building. -- ezekiel 42:5
.
For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground upward, more than the lower and middle ones. -- ezekiel 42:6
.
As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, its length was fifty cubits. -- ezekiel 42:7
.
For the length of the chambers which were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and behold, the length of those facing the temple was a hundred cubits. -- ezekiel 42:8
.
Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court. -- ezekiel 42:9
.
In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, there were chambers. -- ezekiel 42:10
.
The way in front of them was like the appearance of the chambers which were on the north, according to their length so was their width, and all their exits were both according to their arrangements and openings. -- ezekiel 42:11
.
Corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south was an opening at the head of the way, the way in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them. -- ezekiel 42:12
.
Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separate area, they are the holy chambers where the priests who are near to the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering; for the place is holy. -- ezekiel 42:13
.
"When the priests enter, then they shall not go out into the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they shall approach that which is for the people." -- ezekiel 42:14
.
Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faced toward the east and measured it all around. -- ezekiel 42:15
.
He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds by the measuring reed. -- ezekiel 42:16
.
He measured on the north side five hundred reeds by the measuring reed. -- ezekiel 42:17
.
On the south side he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. -- ezekiel 42:18
.
He turned to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. -- ezekiel 42:19
.
He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred and the width five hundred, to divide between the holy and the profane. -- ezekiel 42:20
.
Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing toward the east; -- ezekiel 43:1
.
and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory. -- ezekiel 43:2
.
And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. -- ezekiel 43:3
.
And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate facing toward the east. -- ezekiel 43:4
.
And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house. -- ezekiel 43:5
.
Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing beside me. -- ezekiel 43:6
.
He said to me, "Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel will not again defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their harlotry and by the corpses of their kings when they die, -- ezekiel 43:7
.
by setting their threshold by My threshold and their door post beside My door post, with only the wall between Me and them. And they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed. So I have consumed them in My anger. -- ezekiel 43:8
.
"Now let them put away their harlotry and the corpses of their kings far from Me; and I will dwell among them forever. -- ezekiel 43:9
.
"As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the plan. -- ezekiel 43:10
.
"If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house, its structure, its exits, its entrances, all its designs, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write it in their sight, so that they may observe its whole design and all its statutes and do them. -- ezekiel 43:11
.
"This is the law of the house: its entire area on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. -- ezekiel 43:12
.
"And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): the base shall be a cubit and the width a cubit, and its border on its edge round about one span; and this shall be the height of the base of the altar. -- ezekiel 43:13
.
"From the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits and the width one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits and the width one cubit. -- ezekiel 43:14
.
"The altar hearth shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth shall extend upwards four horns. -- ezekiel 43:15
.
"Now the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides. -- ezekiel 43:16
.
"The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides, the border around it shall be half a cubit and its base shall be a cubit round about; and its steps shall face the east." -- ezekiel 43:17
.
And He said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, 'These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is built, to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it. -- ezekiel 43:18
.
'You shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, who draw near to Me to minister to Me,' declares the Lord GOD, 'a young bull for a sin offering. -- ezekiel 43:19
.
'You shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns and on the four corners of the ledge and on the border round about; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it. -- ezekiel 43:20
.
'You shall also take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary. -- ezekiel 43:21
.
'On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull. -- ezekiel 43:22
.
'When you have finished cleansing it, you shall present a young bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock. -- ezekiel 43:23
.
'You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD. -- ezekiel 43:24
.
'For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering; also a young bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be prepared. -- ezekiel 43:25
.
'For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it. -- ezekiel 43:26
.
'When they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,' declares the Lord GOD." -- ezekiel 43:27
.
Then He brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces the east; and it was shut. -- ezekiel 44:1
.
The LORD said to me, "This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it, for the LORD God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut. -- ezekiel 44:2
.
"As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate and shall go out by the same way." -- ezekiel 44:3
.
Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD, and I fell on my face. -- ezekiel 44:4
.
The LORD said to me, "Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the statutes of the house of the LORD and concerning all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with all exits of the sanctuary. -- ezekiel 44:5
.
"You shall say to the rebellious ones, to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel, -- ezekiel 44:6
.
when you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to profane it, even My house, when you offered My food, the fat and the blood; for they made My covenant void--this in addition to all your abominations. -- ezekiel 44:7
.
"And you have not kept charge of My holy things yourselves, but you have set foreigners to keep charge of My sanctuary." -- ezekiel 44:8
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel, shall enter My sanctuary. -- ezekiel 44:9
.
"But the Levites who went far from Me when Israel went astray, who went astray from Me after their idols, shall bear the punishment for their iniquity. -- ezekiel 44:10
.
"Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house; they shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. -- ezekiel 44:11
.
"Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn against them," declares the Lord GOD, "that they shall bear the punishment for their iniquity. -- ezekiel 44:12
.
"And they shall not come near to Me to serve as a priest to Me, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed. -- ezekiel 44:13
.
"Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the house, of all its service and of all that shall be done in it. -- ezekiel 44:14
.
"But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer Me the fat and the blood," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 44:15
.
"They shall enter My sanctuary; they shall come near to My table to minister to Me and keep My charge. -- ezekiel 44:16
.
"It shall be that when they enter at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and wool shall not be on them while they are ministering in the gates of the inner court and in the house. -- ezekiel 44:17
.
"Linen turbans shall be on their heads and linen undergarments shall be on their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything which makes them sweat. -- ezekiel 44:18
.
"When they go out into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they have been ministering and lay them in the holy chambers; then they shall put on other garments so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments. -- ezekiel 44:19
.
"Also they shall not shave their heads, yet they shall not let their locks grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads. -- ezekiel 44:20
.
"Nor shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter the inner court. -- ezekiel 44:21
.
"And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman but shall take virgins from the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest. -- ezekiel 44:22
.
"Moreover, they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. -- ezekiel 44:23
.
"In a dispute they shall take their stand to judge; they shall judge it according to My ordinances. They shall also keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed feasts and sanctify My sabbaths. -- ezekiel 44:24
.
"They shall not go to a dead person to defile themselves; however, for father, for mother, for son, for daughter, for brother, or for a sister who has not had a husband, they may defile themselves. -- ezekiel 44:25
.
"After he is cleansed, seven days shall elapse for him. -- ezekiel 44:26
.
"On the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 44:27
.
"And it shall be with regard to an inheritance for them, that I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel--I am their possession. -- ezekiel 44:28
.
"They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. -- ezekiel 44:29
.
"The first of all the first fruits of every kind and every contribution of every kind, from all your contributions, shall be for the priests; you shall also give to the priest the first of your dough to cause a blessing to rest on your house. -- ezekiel 44:30
.
"The priests shall not eat any bird or beast that has died a natural death or has been torn to pieces. -- ezekiel 44:31
.
"And when you divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an allotment to the LORD, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of 25,cubits, and the width shall be 20,000. It shall be holy within all its boundary round about. -- ezekiel 45:1
.
"Out of this there shall be for the holy place a square round about five hundred by five hundred cubits, and fifty cubits for its open space round about. -- ezekiel 45:2
.
"From this area you shall measure a length of 25,cubits and a width of 10,000 cubits; and in it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place. -- ezekiel 45:3
.
"It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the LORD, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. -- ezekiel 45:4
.
"An area 25,cubits in length and 10,000 in width shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, and for their possession cities to dwell in. -- ezekiel 45:5
.
"You shall give the city possession of an area 5,cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, alongside the allotment of the holy portion; it shall be for the whole house of Israel. -- ezekiel 45:6
.
"The prince shall have land on either side of the holy allotment and the property of the city, adjacent to the holy allotment and the property of the city, on the west side toward the west and on the east side toward the east, and in length comparable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border. -- ezekiel 45:7
.
"This shall be his land for a possession in Israel; so My princes shall no longer oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes." -- ezekiel 45:8
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Enough, you princes of Israel; put away violence and destruction, and practice justice and righteousness. Stop your expropriations from My people," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 45:9
.
"You shall have just balances, a just ephah and a just bath. -- ezekiel 45:10
.
"The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity, so that the bath will contain a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; their standard shall be according to the homer. -- ezekiel 45:11
.
"The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your maneh. -- ezekiel 45:12
.
"This is the offering that you shall offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley; -- ezekiel 45:13
.
and the prescribed portion of oil (namely, the bath of oil), a tenth of a bath from each kor (which is ten baths or a homer, for ten baths are a homer); -- ezekiel 45:14
.
and one sheep from each flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel--for a grain offering, for a burnt offering and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 45:15
.
"All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel. -- ezekiel 45:16
.
"It shall be the prince's part to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the drink offerings, at the feasts, on the new moons and on the sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he shall provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel." -- ezekiel 45:17
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "In the first month, on the first of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary. -- ezekiel 45:18
.
"The priest shall take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the door posts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar and on the posts of the gate of the inner court. -- ezekiel 45:19
.
"Thus you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who goes astray or is naive; so you shall make atonement for the house. -- ezekiel 45:20
.
"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. -- ezekiel 45:21
.
"On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering. -- ezekiel 45:22
.
"During the seven days of the feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven bulls and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven days, and a male goat daily for a sin offering. -- ezekiel 45:23
.
"He shall provide as a grain offering an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram and a hin of oil with an ephah. -- ezekiel 45:24
.
"In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall provide like this, seven days for the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering and the oil." -- ezekiel 45:25
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "The gate of the inner court facing east shall be shut the six working days; but it shall be opened on the sabbath day and opened on the day of the new moon. -- ezekiel 46:1
.
"The prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the post of the gate. Then the priests shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. -- ezekiel 46:2
.
"The people of the land shall also worship at the doorway of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons. -- ezekiel 46:3
.
"The burnt offering which the prince shall offer to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; -- ezekiel 46:4
.
and the grain offering shall be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah. -- ezekiel 46:5
.
"On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, also six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish. -- ezekiel 46:6
.
"And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil with an ephah. -- ezekiel 46:7
.
"When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate and go out by the same way. -- ezekiel 46:8
.
"But when the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate. And he who enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. No one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered but shall go straight out. -- ezekiel 46:9
.
"When they go in, the prince shall go in among them; and when they go out, he shall go out. -- ezekiel 46:10
.
"At the festivals and the appointed feasts the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull and an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah. -- ezekiel 46:11
.
"When the prince provides a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he goes out. -- ezekiel 46:12
.
"And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it. -- ezekiel 46:13
.
"Also you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually by a perpetual ordinance. -- ezekiel 46:14
.
"Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering." -- ezekiel 46:15
.
'Thus says the Lord GOD, "If the prince gives a gift out of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. -- ezekiel 46:16
.
"But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance shall be only his sons'; it shall belong to them. -- ezekiel 46:17
.
"The prince shall not take from the people's inheritance, thrusting them out of their possession; he shall give his sons inheritance from his own possession so that My people will not be scattered, anyone from his possession."'" -- ezekiel 46:18
.
Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north; and behold, there was a place at the extreme rear toward the west. -- ezekiel 46:19
.
He said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order that they may not bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people." -- ezekiel 46:20
.
Then he brought me out into the outer court and led me across to the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a small court. -- ezekiel 46:21
.
In the four corners of the court there were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; these four in the corners were the same size. -- ezekiel 46:22
.
There was a row of masonry round about in them, around the four of them, and boiling places were made under the rows round about. -- ezekiel 46:23
.
Then he said to me, "These are the boiling places where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people." -- ezekiel 46:24
.
Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of the house, from south of the altar. -- ezekiel 47:1
.
He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. And behold, water was trickling from the south side. -- ezekiel 47:2
.
When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles. -- ezekiel 47:3
.
Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the knees. Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the loins. -- ezekiel 47:4
.
Again he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not ford, for the water had risen, enough water to swim in, a river that could not be forded. -- ezekiel 47:5
.
He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he brought me back to the bank of the river. -- ezekiel 47:6
.
Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river there were very many trees on the one side and on the other. -- ezekiel 47:7
.
Then he said to me, "These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters of the sea become fresh. -- ezekiel 47:8
.
"It will come about that every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes, will live. And there will be very many fish, for these waters go there and the others become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes. -- ezekiel 47:9
.
"And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many. -- ezekiel 47:10
.
"But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt. -- ezekiel 47:11
.
"By the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail. They will bear every month because their water flows from the sanctuary, and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing." -- ezekiel 47:12
.
Thus says the Lord GOD, "This shall be the boundary by which you shall divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall have two portions. -- ezekiel 47:13
.
"You shall divide it for an inheritance, each one equally with the other; for I swore to give it to your forefathers, and this land shall fall to you as an inheritance. -- ezekiel 47:14
.
"This shall be the boundary of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad; -- ezekiel 47:15
.
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. -- ezekiel 47:16
.
"The boundary shall extend from the sea to Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the border of Hamath. This is the north side. -- ezekiel 47:17
.
"The east side, from between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the eastern sea you shall measure. This is the east side. -- ezekiel 47:18
.
"The south side toward the south shall extend from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the south. -- ezekiel 47:19
.
"The west side shall be the Great Sea, from the south border to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side. -- ezekiel 47:20
.
"So you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. -- ezekiel 47:21
.
"You shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among the aliens who stay in your midst, who bring forth sons in your midst. And they shall be to you as the native-born among the sons of Israel; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. -- ezekiel 47:22
.
"And in the tribe with which the alien stays, there you shall give him his inheritance," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 47:23
.
"Now these are the names of the tribes: from the northern extremity, beside the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, toward the north beside Hamath, running from east to west, Dan, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:1
.
"Beside the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:2
.
"Beside the border of Asher, from the east side to the west side, Naphtali, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:3
.
"Beside the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:4
.
"Beside the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:5
.
"Beside the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west side, Reuben, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:6
.
"Beside the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:7
.
"And beside the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the allotment which you shall set apart, 25,cubits in width, and in length like one of the portions, from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it. -- ezekiel 48:8
.
"The allotment that you shall set apart to the LORD shall be 25,cubits in length and 10,000 in width. -- ezekiel 48:9
.
"The holy allotment shall be for these, namely for the priests, toward the north 25,cubits in length, toward the west 10,000 in width, toward the east 10,000 in width, and toward the south 25,000 in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in its midst. -- ezekiel 48:10
.
"It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray as the Levites went astray. -- ezekiel 48:11
.
"It shall be an allotment to them from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, by the border of the Levites. -- ezekiel 48:12
.
"Alongside the border of the priests the Levites shall have 25,cubits in length and 10,000 in width. The whole length shall be 25,000 cubits and the width 10,000. -- ezekiel 48:13
.
"Moreover, they shall not sell or exchange any of it, or alienate this choice portion of land; for it is holy to the LORD. -- ezekiel 48:14
.
"The remainder, 5,cubits in width and 25,000 in length, shall be for common use for the city, for dwellings and for open spaces; and the city shall be in its midst. -- ezekiel 48:15
.
"These shall be its measurements: the north side 4,cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits. -- ezekiel 48:16
.
"The city shall have open spaces: on the north cubits, on the south 250 cubits, on the east 250 cubits, and on the west 250 cubits. -- ezekiel 48:17
.
"The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment shall be 10,cubits toward the east and 10,000 toward the west; and it shall be alongside the holy allotment. And its produce shall be food for the workers of the city. -- ezekiel 48:18
.
"The workers of the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it. -- ezekiel 48:19
.
"The whole allotment shall be 25,by 25,000 cubits; you shall set apart the holy allotment, a square, with the property of the city. -- ezekiel 48:20
.
"The remainder shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy allotment and of the property of the city; in front of the 25,cubits of the allotment toward the east border and westward in front of the 25,000 toward the west border, alongside the portions, it shall be for the prince. And the holy allotment and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the middle of it. -- ezekiel 48:21
.
"Exclusive of the property of the Levites and the property of the city, which are in the middle of that which belongs to the prince, everything between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be for the prince. -- ezekiel 48:22
.
"As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:23
.
"Beside the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:24
.
"Beside the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:25
.
"Beside the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:26
.
"Beside the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one portion. -- ezekiel 48:27
.
"And beside the border of Gad, at the south side toward the south, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, to the Great Sea. -- ezekiel 48:28
.
"This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for an inheritance, and these are their several portions," declares the Lord GOD. -- ezekiel 48:29
.
"These are the exits of the city: on the north side, 4,cubits by measurement, -- ezekiel 48:30
.
shall be the gates of the city, named for the tribes of Israel, three gates toward the north: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one. -- ezekiel 48:31
.
"On the east side, 4,cubits, shall be three gates: the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one. -- ezekiel 48:32
.
"On the south side, 4,cubits by measurement, shall be three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one. -- ezekiel 48:33
.
"On the west side, 4,cubits, shall be three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one. -- ezekiel 48:34
.
"The city shall be 18,cubits round about; and the name of the city from that day shall be, 'The LORD is there.'" -- ezekiel 48:35
.
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. -- daniel 1:1
.
The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god. -- daniel 1:2
.
Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles, -- daniel 1:3
.
youths in whom was no defect, who were good-looking, showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability for serving in the king's court; and he ordered him to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. -- daniel 1:4
.
The king appointed for them a daily ration from the king's choice food and from the wine which he drank, and appointed that they should be educated three years, at the end of which they were to enter the king's personal service. -- daniel 1:5
.
Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. -- daniel 1:6
.
Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego. -- daniel 1:7
.
But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king's choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself. -- daniel 1:8
.
Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials, -- daniel 1:9
.
and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king." -- daniel 1:10
.
But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, -- daniel 1:11
.
"Please test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink. -- daniel 1:12
.
"Then let our appearance be observed in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king's choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see." -- daniel 1:13
.
So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days. -- daniel 1:14
.
At the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king's choice food. -- daniel 1:15
.
So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables. -- daniel 1:16
.
As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every branch of literature and wisdom; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams. -- daniel 1:17
.
Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar. -- daniel 1:18
.
The king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's personal service. -- daniel 1:19
.
As for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm. -- daniel 1:20
.
And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king. -- daniel 1:21
.
Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him. -- daniel 2:1
.
Then the king gave orders to call in the magicians, the conjurers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. -- daniel 2:2
.
The king said to them, "I had a dream and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream." -- daniel 2:3
.
Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: "O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation." -- daniel 2:4
.
The king replied to the Chaldeans, "The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap. -- daniel 2:5
.
"But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation." -- daniel 2:6
.
They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation." -- daniel 2:7
.
The king replied, "I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm, -- daniel 2:8
.
that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation." -- daniel 2:9
.
The Chaldeans answered the king and said, "There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any magician, conjurer or Chaldean. -- daniel 2:10
.
"Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh." -- daniel 2:11
.
Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:12
.
So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them. -- daniel 2:13
.
Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king's bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; -- daniel 2:14
.
he said to Arioch, the king's commander, "For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent?" Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter. -- daniel 2:15
.
So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king. -- daniel 2:16
.
Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter, -- daniel 2:17
.
so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:18
.
Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven; -- daniel 2:19
.
Daniel said, "Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him. -- daniel 2:20
.
"It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men And knowledge to men of understanding. -- daniel 2:21
.
"It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, And the light dwells with Him. -- daniel 2:22
.
"To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, For You have given me wisdom and power; Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You, For You have made known to us the king's matter." -- daniel 2:23
.
Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows: "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king's presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king." -- daniel 2:24
.
Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king's presence and spoke to him as follows: "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!" -- daniel 2:25
.
The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?" -- daniel 2:26
.
Daniel answered before the king and said, "As for the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians nor diviners are able to declare it to the king. -- daniel 2:27
.
"However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed. -- daniel 2:28
.
"As for you, O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future; and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will take place. -- daniel 2:29
.
"But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living man, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind. -- daniel 2:30
.
"You, O king, were looking and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome. -- daniel 2:31
.
"The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, -- daniel 2:32
.
its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. -- daniel 2:33
.
"You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. -- daniel 2:34
.
"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. -- daniel 2:35
.
"This was the dream; now we will tell its interpretation before the king. -- daniel 2:36
.
"You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory; -- daniel 2:37
.
and wherever the sons of men dwell, or the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has caused you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold. -- daniel 2:38
.
"After you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth. -- daniel 2:39
.
"Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces. -- daniel 2:40
.
"In that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay. -- daniel 2:41
.
"As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery, so some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle. -- daniel 2:42
.
"And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, even as iron does not combine with pottery. -- daniel 2:43
.
"In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever. -- daniel 2:44
.
"Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy." -- daniel 2:45
.
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense. -- daniel 2:46
.
The king answered Daniel and said, "Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery." -- daniel 2:47
.
Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. -- daniel 2:48
.
And Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king's court. -- daniel 2:49
.
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. -- daniel 3:1
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. -- daniel 3:2
.
Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. -- daniel 3:3
.
Then the herald loudly proclaimed: "To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language, -- daniel 3:4
.
that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. -- daniel 3:5
.
"But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire." -- daniel 3:6
.
Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. -- daniel 3:7
.
For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews. -- daniel 3:8
.
They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: "O king, live forever! -- daniel 3:9
.
"You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image. -- daniel 3:10
.
"But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire. -- daniel 3:11
.
"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up." -- daniel 3:12
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king. -- daniel 3:13
.
Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up? -- daniel 3:14
.
"Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery and bagpipe and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands?" -- daniel 3:15
.
Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter. -- daniel 3:16
.
"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king. -- daniel 3:17
.
"But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up." -- daniel 3:18
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. -- daniel 3:19
.
He commanded certain valiant warriors who were in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in order to cast them into the furnace of blazing fire. -- daniel 3:20
.
Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps and their other clothes, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. -- daniel 3:21
.
For this reason, because the king's command was urgent and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. -- daniel 3:22
.
But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up. -- daniel 3:23
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he said to his high officials, "Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?" They replied to the king, "Certainly, O king." -- daniel 3:24
.
He said, "Look! I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!" -- daniel 3:25
.
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he responded and said, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire. -- daniel 3:26
.
The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king's high officials gathered around and saw in regard to these men that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men nor was the hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had the smell of fire even come upon them. -- daniel 3:27
.
Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king's command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God. -- daniel 3:28
.
"Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation or tongue that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to a rubbish heap, inasmuch as there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way." -- daniel 3:29
.
Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon. -- daniel 3:30
.
Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and men of every language that live in all the earth: "May your peace abound! -- daniel 4:1
.
"It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me. -- daniel 4:2
.
"How great are His signs And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom And His dominion is from generation to generation. -- daniel 4:3
.
"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace. -- daniel 4:4
.
"I saw a dream and it made me fearful; and these fantasies as I lay on my bed and the visions in my mind kept alarming me. -- daniel 4:5
.
"So I gave orders to bring into my presence all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. -- daniel 4:6
.
"Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners came in and I related the dream to them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me. -- daniel 4:7
.
"But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and I related the dream to him, saying, -- daniel 4:8
.
'O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, along with its interpretation. -- daniel 4:9
.
'Now these were the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed: I was looking, and behold, there was a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was great. -- daniel 4:10
.
'The tree grew large and became strong And its height reached to the sky, And it was visible to the end of the whole earth. -- daniel 4:11
.
'Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, And in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches, And all living creatures fed themselves from it. -- daniel 4:12
.
'I was looking in the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed, and behold, an angelic watcher, a holy one, descended from heaven. -- daniel 4:13
.
'He shouted out and spoke as follows: "Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit; Let the beasts flee from under it And the birds from its branches. -- daniel 4:14
.
"Yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, But with a band of iron and bronze around it In the new grass of the field; And let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth. -- daniel 4:15
.
"Let his mind be changed from that of a man And let a beast's mind be given to him, And let seven periods of time pass over him. -- daniel 4:16
.
"This sentence is by the decree of the angelic watchers And the decision is a command of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, And bestows it on whom He wishes And sets over it the lowliest of men." -- daniel 4:17
.
'This is the dream which I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me its interpretation, inasmuch as none of the wise men of my kingdom is able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.' -- daniel 4:18
.
"Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him. The king responded and said, 'Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.' Belteshazzar replied, 'My lord, if only the dream applied to those who hate you and its interpretation to your adversaries! -- daniel 4:19
.
'The tree that you saw, which became large and grew strong, whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth -- daniel 4:20
.
and whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged-- -- daniel 4:21
.
it is you, O king; for you have become great and grown strong, and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth. -- daniel 4:22
.
'In that the king saw an angelic watcher, a holy one, descending from heaven and saying, "Chop down the tree and destroy it; yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, but with a band of iron and bronze around it in the new grass of the field, and let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him," -- daniel 4:23
.
this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king: -- daniel 4:24
.
that you be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes. -- daniel 4:25
.
'And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree, your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that it is Heaven that rules. -- daniel 4:26
.
'Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you: break away now from your sins by doing righteousness and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, in case there may be a prolonging of your prosperity.' -- daniel 4:27
.
"All this happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king. -- daniel 4:28
.
"Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon. -- daniel 4:29
.
"The king reflected and said, 'Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?' -- daniel 4:30
.
"While the word was in the king's mouth, a voice came from heaven, saying, 'King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: sovereignty has been removed from you, -- daniel 4:31
.
and you will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field. You will be given grass to eat like cattle, and seven periods of time will pass over you until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.' -- daniel 4:32
.
"Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles' feathers and his nails like birds' claws. -- daniel 4:33
.
"But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever; For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom endures from generation to generation. -- daniel 4:34
.
"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, But He does according to His will in the host of heaven And among the inhabitants of earth; And no one can ward off His hand Or say to Him, 'What have You done?' -- daniel 4:35
.
"At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty, and surpassing greatness was added to me. -- daniel 4:36
.
"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride." -- daniel 4:37
.
Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand. -- daniel 5:1
.
When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them. -- daniel 5:2
.
Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them. -- daniel 5:3
.
They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone. -- daniel 5:4
.
Suddenly the fingers of a man's hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing. -- daniel 5:5
.
Then the king's face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him, and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together. -- daniel 5:6
.
The king called aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, "Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me shall be clothed with purple and have a necklace of gold around his neck, and have authority as third ruler in the kingdom." -- daniel 5:7
.
Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king. -- daniel 5:8
.
Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, his face grew even paler, and his nobles were perplexed. -- daniel 5:9
.
The queen entered the banquet hall because of the words of the king and his nobles; the queen spoke and said, "O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you or your face be pale. -- daniel 5:10
.
"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, illumination, insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and diviners. -- daniel 5:11
.
"This was because an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas and solving of difficult problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Let Daniel now be summoned and he will declare the interpretation." -- daniel 5:12
.
Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah? -- daniel 5:13
.
"Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you. -- daniel 5:14
.
"Just now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message. -- daniel 5:15
.
"But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and wear a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom." -- daniel 5:16
.
Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him. -- daniel 5:17
.
"O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father. -- daniel 5:18
.
"Because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and men of every language feared and trembled before him; whomever he wished he killed and whomever he wished he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated and whomever he wished he humbled. -- daniel 5:19
.
"But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him. -- daniel 5:20
.
"He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of beasts, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he recognized that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind and that He sets over it whomever He wishes. -- daniel 5:21
.
"Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this, -- daniel 5:22
.
but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and all your ways, you have not glorified. -- daniel 5:23
.
"Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out. -- daniel 5:24
.
"Now this is the inscription that was written out: 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.' -- daniel 5:25
.
"This is the interpretation of the message: 'MENE'--God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it. -- daniel 5:26
.
" 'TEKEL'--you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient. -- daniel 5:27
.
" 'PERES'--your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians." -- daniel 5:28
.
Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a necklace of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he now had authority as the third ruler in the kingdom. -- daniel 5:29
.
That same night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain. -- daniel 5:30
.
So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two. -- daniel 5:31
.
It seemed good to Darius to appoint satraps over the kingdom, that they would be in charge of the whole kingdom, -- daniel 6:1
.
and over them three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, and that the king might not suffer loss. -- daniel 6:2
.
Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom. -- daniel 6:3
.
Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him. -- daniel 6:4
.
Then these men said, "We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him with regard to the law of his God." -- daniel 6:5
.
Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: "King Darius, live forever! -- daniel 6:6
.
"All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions' den. -- daniel 6:7
.
"Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked." -- daniel 6:8
.
Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction. -- daniel 6:9
.
Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously. -- daniel 6:10
.
Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. -- daniel 6:11
.
Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king's injunction, "Did you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions' den?" The king replied, "The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked." -- daniel 6:12
.
Then they answered and spoke before the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition three times a day." -- daniel 6:13
.
Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed and set his mind on delivering Daniel; and even until sunset he kept exerting himself to rescue him. -- daniel 6:14
.
Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, "Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed." -- daniel 6:15
.
Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and cast into the lions' den. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Your God whom you constantly serve will Himself deliver you." -- daniel 6:16
.
A stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed in regard to Daniel. -- daniel 6:17
.
Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him. -- daniel 6:18
.
Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions' den. -- daniel 6:19
.
When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?" -- daniel 6:20
.
Then Daniel spoke to the king, "O king, live forever! -- daniel 6:21
.
"My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime." -- daniel 6:22
.
Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. -- daniel 6:23
.
The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions' den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones. -- daniel 6:24
.
Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language who were living in all the land: "May your peace abound! -- daniel 6:25
.
"I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion will be forever. -- daniel 6:26
.
"He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions." -- daniel 6:27
.
So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. -- daniel 6:28
.
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed; then he wrote the dream down and related the following summary of it. -- daniel 7:1
.
Daniel said, "I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. -- daniel 7:2
.
"And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another. -- daniel 7:3
.
"The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind also was given to it. -- daniel 7:4
.
"And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, 'Arise, devour much meat!' -- daniel 7:5
.
"After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it. -- daniel 7:6
.
"After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. -- daniel 7:7
.
"While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts. -- daniel 7:8
.
"I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, Its wheels were a burning fire. -- daniel 7:9
.
"A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; The court sat, And the books were opened. -- daniel 7:10
.
"Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire. -- daniel 7:11
.
"As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time. -- daniel 7:12
.
"I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him. -- daniel 7:13
.
"And to Him was given dominion, Glory and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations and men of every language Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed. -- daniel 7:14
.
"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions in my mind kept alarming me. -- daniel 7:15
.
"I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: -- daniel 7:16
.
'These great beasts, which are four in number, are four kings who will arise from the earth. -- daniel 7:17
.
'But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.' -- daniel 7:18
.
"Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, and which devoured, crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet, -- daniel 7:19
.
and the meaning of the ten horns that were on its head and the other horn which came up, and before which three of them fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great boasts and which was larger in appearance than its associates. -- daniel 7:20
.
"I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them -- daniel 7:21
.
until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom. -- daniel 7:22
.
"Thus he said: 'The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it. -- daniel 7:23
.
'As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings. -- daniel 7:24
.
'He will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. -- daniel 7:25
.
'But the court will sit for judgment, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever. -- daniel 7:26
.
'Then the sovereignty, the dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.' -- daniel 7:27
.
"At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale, but I kept the matter to myself." -- daniel 7:28
.
In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously. -- daniel 8:1
.
I looked in the vision, and while I was looking I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal. -- daniel 8:2
.
Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last. -- daniel 8:3
.
I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no other beasts could stand before him nor was there anyone to rescue from his power, but he did as he pleased and magnified himself. -- daniel 8:4
.
While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. -- daniel 8:5
.
He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath. -- daniel 8:6
.
I saw him come beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was none to rescue the ram from his power. -- daniel 8:7
.
Then the male goat magnified himself exceedingly. But as soon as he was mighty, the large horn was broken; and in its place there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven. -- daniel 8:8
.
Out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful Land. -- daniel 8:9
.
It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down. -- daniel 8:10
.
It even magnified itself to be equal with the Commander of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down. -- daniel 8:11
.
And on account of transgression the host will be given over to the horn along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform its will and prosper. -- daniel 8:12
.
Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, "How long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply, while the transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled?" -- daniel 8:13
.
He said to me, "For 2,evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be properly restored." -- daniel 8:14
.
When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man. -- daniel 8:15
.
And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, and he called out and said, "Gabriel, give this man an understanding of the vision." -- daniel 8:16
.
So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, "Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end." -- daniel 8:17
.
Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright. -- daniel 8:18
.
He said, "Behold, I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation, for it pertains to the appointed time of the end. -- daniel 8:19
.
"The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia. -- daniel 8:20
.
"The shaggy goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king. -- daniel 8:21
.
"The broken horn and the four horns that arose in its place represent four kingdoms which will arise from his nation, although not with his power. -- daniel 8:22
.
"In the latter period of their rule, When the transgressors have run their course, A king will arise, Insolent and skilled in intrigue. -- daniel 8:23
.
"His power will be mighty, but not by his own power, And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree And prosper and perform his will; He will destroy mighty men and the holy people. -- daniel 8:24
.
"And through his shrewdness He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence; And he will magnify himself in his heart, And he will destroy many while they are at ease. He will even oppose the Prince of princes, But he will be broken without human agency. -- daniel 8:25
.
"The vision of the evenings and mornings Which has been told is true; But keep the vision secret, For it pertains to many days in the future." -- daniel 8:26
.
Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up again and carried on the king's business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was none to explain it. -- daniel 8:27
.
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans-- -- daniel 9:1
.
in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which was revealed as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years. -- daniel 9:2
.
So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes. -- daniel 9:3
.
I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed and said, "Alas, O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments, -- daniel 9:4
.
we have sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances. -- daniel 9:5
.
"Moreover, we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers and all the people of the land. -- daniel 9:6
.
"Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is this day--to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds which they have committed against You. -- daniel 9:7
.
"Open shame belongs to us, O Lord, to our kings, our princes and our fathers, because we have sinned against You. -- daniel 9:8
.
"To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him; -- daniel 9:9
.
nor have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His teachings which He set before us through His servants the prophets. -- daniel 9:10
.
"Indeed all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out on us, along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him. -- daniel 9:11
.
"Thus He has confirmed His words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring on us great calamity; for under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what was done to Jerusalem. -- daniel 9:12
.
"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us; yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquity and giving attention to Your truth. -- daniel 9:13
.
"Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store and brought it on us; for the LORD our God is righteous with respect to all His deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice. -- daniel 9:14
.
"And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made a name for Yourself, as it is this day--we have sinned, we have been wicked. -- daniel 9:15
.
"O Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous acts, let now Your anger and Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us. -- daniel 9:16
.
"So now, our God, listen to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplications, and for Your sake, O Lord, let Your face shine on Your desolate sanctuary. -- daniel 9:17
.
"O my God, incline Your ear and hear! Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You on account of any merits of our own, but on account of Your great compassion. -- daniel 9:18
.
"O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! For Your own sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name." -- daniel 9:19
.
Now while I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God in behalf of the holy mountain of my God, -- daniel 9:20
.
while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in my extreme weariness about the time of the evening offering. -- daniel 9:21
.
He gave me instruction and talked with me and said, "O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding. -- daniel 9:22
.
"At the beginning of your supplications the command was issued, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed; so give heed to the message and gain understanding of the vision. -- daniel 9:23
.
"Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place. -- daniel 9:24
.
"So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress. -- daniel 9:25
.
"Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined. -- daniel 9:26
.
"And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate." -- daniel 9:27
.
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and one of great conflict, but he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision. -- daniel 10:1
.
In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks. -- daniel 10:2
.
I did not eat any tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all until the entire three weeks were completed. -- daniel 10:3
.
On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris, -- daniel 10:4
.
I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was girded with a belt of pure gold of Uphaz. -- daniel 10:5
.
His body also was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a tumult. -- daniel 10:6
.
Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves. -- daniel 10:7
.
So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength. -- daniel 10:8
.
But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground. -- daniel 10:9
.
Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. -- daniel 10:10
.
He said to me, "O Daniel, man of high esteem, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. -- daniel 10:11
.
Then he said to me, "Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words. -- daniel 10:12
.
"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia. -- daniel 10:13
.
"Now I have come to give you an understanding of what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to the days yet future." -- daniel 10:14
.
When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless. -- daniel 10:15
.
And behold, one who resembled a human being was touching my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, "O my lord, as a result of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength. -- daniel 10:16
.
"For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as my lord? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me." -- daniel 10:17
.
Then this one with human appearance touched me again and strengthened me. -- daniel 10:18
.
He said, "O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!" Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, "May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me." -- daniel 10:19
.
Then he said, "Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come. -- daniel 10:20
.
"However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these forces except Michael your prince. -- daniel 10:21
.
"In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him. -- daniel 11:1
.
"And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all of them; as soon as he becomes strong through his riches, he will arouse the whole empire against the realm of Greece. -- daniel 11:2
.
"And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases. -- daniel 11:3
.
"But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his own descendants, nor according to his authority which he wielded, for his sovereignty will be uprooted and given to others besides them. -- daniel 11:4
.
"Then the king of the South will grow strong, along with one of his princes who will gain ascendancy over him and obtain dominion; his domain will be a great dominion indeed. -- daniel 11:5
.
"After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to carry out a peaceful arrangement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power, but she will be given up, along with those who brought her in and the one who sired her as well as he who supported her in those times. -- daniel 11:6
.
"But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against their army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and display great strength. -- daniel 11:7
.
"Also their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold he will take into captivity to Egypt, and he on his part will refrain from attacking the king of the North for some years. -- daniel 11:8
.
"Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his own land. -- daniel 11:9
.
"His sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, that he may again wage war up to his very fortress. -- daniel 11:10
.
"The king of the South will be enraged and go forth and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but that multitude will be given into the hand of the former. -- daniel 11:11
.
"When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail. -- daniel 11:12
.
"For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment. -- daniel 11:13
.
"Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down. -- daniel 11:14
.
"Then the king of the North will come, cast up a siege ramp and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand their ground, not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand. -- daniel 11:15
.
"But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand him; he will also stay for a time in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand. -- daniel 11:16
.
"He will set his face to come with the power of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand for him or be on his side. -- daniel 11:17
.
"Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his scorn against him; moreover, he will repay him for his scorn. -- daniel 11:18
.
"So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be found no more. -- daniel 11:19
.
"Then in his place one will arise who will send an oppressor through the Jewel of his kingdom; yet within a few days he will be shattered, though not in anger nor in battle. -- daniel 11:20
.
"In his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the honor of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue. -- daniel 11:21
.
"The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant. -- daniel 11:22
.
"After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small force of people. -- daniel 11:23
.
"In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest parts of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers never did, nor his ancestors; he will distribute plunder, booty and possessions among them, and he will devise his schemes against strongholds, but only for a time. -- daniel 11:24
.
"He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him. -- daniel 11:25
.
"Those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain. -- daniel 11:26
.
"As for both kings, their hearts will be intent on evil, and they will speak lies to each other at the same table; but it will not succeed, for the end is still to come at the appointed time. -- daniel 11:27
.
"Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and then return to his own land. -- daniel 11:28
.
"At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before. -- daniel 11:29
.
"For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. -- daniel 11:30
.
"Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation. -- daniel 11:31
.
"By smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will display strength and take action. -- daniel 11:32
.
"Those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for many days. -- daniel 11:33
.
"Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy. -- daniel 11:34
.
"Some of those who have insight will fall, in order to refine, purge and make them pure until the end time; because it is still to come at the appointed time. -- daniel 11:35
.
"Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done. -- daniel 11:36
.
"He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will magnify himself above them all. -- daniel 11:37
.
"But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, costly stones and treasures. -- daniel 11:38
.
"He will take action against the strongest of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel out land for a price. -- daniel 11:39
.
"At the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them and pass through. -- daniel 11:40
.
"He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon. -- daniel 11:41
.
"Then he will stretch out his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape. -- daniel 11:42
.
"But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels. -- daniel 11:43
.
"But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many. -- daniel 11:44
.
"He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him. -- daniel 11:45
.
"Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued. -- daniel 12:1
.
"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt. -- daniel 12:2
.
"Those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. -- daniel 12:3
.
"But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the book until the end of time; many will go back and forth, and knowledge will increase." -- daniel 12:4
.
Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on that bank of the river. -- daniel 12:5
.
And one said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long will it be until the end of these wonders?" -- daniel 12:6
.
I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time; and as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, all these events will be completed. -- daniel 12:7
.
As for me, I heard but could not understand; so I said, "My lord, what will be the outcome of these events?" -- daniel 12:8
.
He said, "Go your way, Daniel, for these words are concealed and sealed up until the end time. -- daniel 12:9
.
"Many will be purged, purified and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand. -- daniel 12:10
.
"From the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,days. -- daniel 12:11
.
"How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 1,days! -- daniel 12:12
.
"But as for you, go your way to the end; then you will enter into rest and rise again for your allotted portion at the end of the age." -- daniel 12:13
.
The word of the LORD which came to Hosea the son of Beeri, during the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. -- hosea 1:1
.
When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, "Go, take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry; for the land commits flagrant harlotry, forsaking the LORD." -- hosea 1:2
.
So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. -- hosea 1:3
.
And the LORD said to him, "Name him Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. -- hosea 1:4
.
"On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel." -- hosea 1:5
.
Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the LORD said to him, "Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that I would ever forgive them. -- hosea 1:6
.
"But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by the LORD their God, and will not deliver them by bow, sword, battle, horses or horsemen." -- hosea 1:7
.
When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. -- hosea 1:8
.
And the LORD said, "Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people and I am not your God." -- hosea 1:9
.
Yet the number of the sons of Israel Will be like the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered; And in the place Where it is said to them, "You are not My people," It will be said to them, "You are the sons of the living God." -- hosea 1:10
.
And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together, And they will appoint for themselves one leader, And they will go up from the land, For great will be the day of Jezreel. -- hosea 1:11
.
Say to your brothers, "Ammi," and to your sisters, "Ruhamah." -- hosea 2:1
.
"Contend with your mother, contend, For she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; And let her put away her harlotry from her face And her adultery from between her breasts, -- hosea 2:2
.
Or I will strip her naked And expose her as on the day when she was born. I will also make her like a wilderness, Make her like desert land And slay her with thirst. -- hosea 2:3
.
"Also, I will have no compassion on her children, Because they are children of harlotry. -- hosea 2:4
.
"For their mother has played the harlot; She who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, Who give me my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.' -- hosea 2:5
.
"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths. -- hosea 2:6
.
"She will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them; And she will seek them, but will not find them. Then she will say, 'I will go back to my first husband, For it was better for me then than now!' -- hosea 2:7
.
"For she does not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine and the oil, And lavished on her silver and gold, Which they used for Baal. -- hosea 2:8
.
"Therefore, I will take back My grain at harvest time And My new wine in its season. I will also take away My wool and My flax Given to cover her nakedness. -- hosea 2:9
.
"And then I will uncover her lewdness In the sight of her lovers, And no one will rescue her out of My hand. -- hosea 2:10
.
"I will also put an end to all her gaiety, Her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths And all her festal assemblies. -- hosea 2:11
.
"I will destroy her vines and fig trees, Of which she said, 'These are my wages Which my lovers have given me.' And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field will devour them. -- hosea 2:12
.
"I will punish her for the days of the Baals When she used to offer sacrifices to them And adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry, And follow her lovers, so that she forgot Me," declares the LORD. -- hosea 2:13
.
"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Bring her into the wilderness And speak kindly to her. -- hosea 2:14
.
"Then I will give her her vineyards from there, And the valley of Achor as a door of hope. And she will sing there as in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt. -- hosea 2:15
.
"It will come about in that day," declares the LORD, "That you will call Me Ishi And will no longer call Me Baali. -- hosea 2:16
.
"For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, So that they will be mentioned by their names no more. -- hosea 2:17
.
"In that day I will also make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, The birds of the sky And the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword and war from the land, And will make them lie down in safety. -- hosea 2:18
.
"I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In lovingkindness and in compassion, -- hosea 2:19
.
And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD. -- hosea 2:20
.
"It will come about in that day that I will respond," declares the LORD. "I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth, -- hosea 2:21
.
And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine and to the oil, And they will respond to Jezreel. -- hosea 2:22
.
"I will sow her for Myself in the land. I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion, And I will say to those who were not My people, 'You are My people!' And they will say, 'You are my God!'" -- hosea 2:23
.
Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes." -- hosea 3:1
.
So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley. -- hosea 3:2
.
Then I said to her, "You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you." -- hosea 3:3
.
For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar and without ephod or household idols. -- hosea 3:4
.
Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days. -- hosea 3:5
.
Listen to the word of the LORD, O sons of Israel, For the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no faithfulness or kindness Or knowledge of God in the land. -- hosea 4:1
.
There is swearing, deception, murder, stealing and adultery. They employ violence, so that bloodshed follows bloodshed. -- hosea 4:2
.
Therefore the land mourns, And everyone who lives in it languishes Along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky, And also the fish of the sea disappear. -- hosea 4:3
.
Yet let no one find fault, and let none offer reproof; For your people are like those who contend with the priest. -- hosea 4:4
.
So you will stumble by day, And the prophet also will stumble with you by night; And I will destroy your mother. -- hosea 4:5
.
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children. -- hosea 4:6
.
The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame. -- hosea 4:7
.
They feed on the sin of My people And direct their desire toward their iniquity. -- hosea 4:8
.
And it will be, like people, like priest; So I will punish them for their ways And repay them for their deeds. -- hosea 4:9
.
They will eat, but not have enough; They will play the harlot, but not increase, Because they have stopped giving heed to the LORD. -- hosea 4:10
.
Harlotry, wine and new wine take away the understanding. -- hosea 4:11
.
My people consult their wooden idol, and their diviner's wand informs them; For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray, And they have played the harlot, departing from their God. -- hosea 4:12
.
They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains And burn incense on the hills, Under oak, poplar and terebinth, Because their shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters play the harlot And your brides commit adultery. -- hosea 4:13
.
I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot Or your brides when they commit adultery, For the men themselves go apart with harlots And offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes; So the people without understanding are ruined. -- hosea 4:14
.
Though you, Israel, play the harlot, Do not let Judah become guilty; Also do not go to Gilgal, Or go up to Beth-aven And take the oath: "As the LORD lives!" -- hosea 4:15
.
Since Israel is stubborn Like a stubborn heifer, Can the LORD now pasture them Like a lamb in a large field? -- hosea 4:16
.
Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone. -- hosea 4:17
.
Their liquor gone, They play the harlot continually; Their rulers dearly love shame. -- hosea 4:18
.
The wind wraps them in its wings, And they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices. -- hosea 4:19
.
Hear this, O priests! Give heed, O house of Israel! Listen, O house of the king! For the judgment applies to you, For you have been a snare at Mizpah And a net spread out on Tabor. -- hosea 5:1
.
The revolters have gone deep in depravity, But I will chastise all of them. -- hosea 5:2
.
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you have played the harlot, Israel has defiled itself. -- hosea 5:3
.
Their deeds will not allow them To return to their God. For a spirit of harlotry is within them, And they do not know the LORD. -- hosea 5:4
.
Moreover, the pride of Israel testifies against him, And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also has stumbled with them. -- hosea 5:5
.
They will go with their flocks and herds To seek the LORD, but they will not find Him; He has withdrawn from them. -- hosea 5:6
.
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, For they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their land. -- hosea 5:7
.
Blow the horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: "Behind you, Benjamin!" -- hosea 5:8
.
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I declare what is sure. -- hosea 5:9
.
The princes of Judah have become like those who move a boundary; On them I will pour out My wrath like water. -- hosea 5:10
.
Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, Because he was determined to follow man's command. -- hosea 5:11
.
Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim And like rottenness to the house of Judah. -- hosea 5:12
.
When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb. But he is unable to heal you, Or to cure you of your wound. -- hosea 5:13
.
For I will be like a lion to Ephraim And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear to pieces and go away, I will carry away, and there will be none to deliver. -- hosea 5:14
.
I will go away and return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me. -- hosea 5:15
.
"Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bandage us. -- hosea 6:1
.
"He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him. -- hosea 6:2
.
"So let us know, let us press on to know the LORD. His going forth is as certain as the dawn; And He will come to us like the rain, Like the spring rain watering the earth." -- hosea 6:3
.
What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud And like the dew which goes away early. -- hosea 6:4
.
Therefore I have hewn them in pieces by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And the judgments on you are like the light that goes forth. -- hosea 6:5
.
For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. -- hosea 6:6
.
But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously against Me. -- hosea 6:7
.
Gilead is a city of wrongdoers, Tracked with bloody footprints. -- hosea 6:8
.
And as raiders wait for a man, So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they have committed crime. -- hosea 6:9
.
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's harlotry is there, Israel has defiled itself. -- hosea 6:10
.
Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, When I restore the fortunes of My people. -- hosea 6:11
.
When I would heal Israel, The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, And the evil deeds of Samaria, For they deal falsely; The thief enters in, Bandits raid outside, -- hosea 7:1
.
And they do not consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds are all around them; They are before My face. -- hosea 7:2
.
With their wickedness they make the king glad, And the princes with their lies. -- hosea 7:3
.
They are all adulterers, Like an oven heated by the baker Who ceases to stir up the fire From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened. -- hosea 7:4
.
On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers, -- hosea 7:5
.
For their hearts are like an oven As they approach their plotting; Their anger smolders all night, In the morning it burns like a flaming fire. -- hosea 7:6
.
All of them are hot like an oven, And they consume their rulers; All their kings have fallen. None of them calls on Me. -- hosea 7:7
.
Ephraim mixes himself with the nations; Ephraim has become a cake not turned. -- hosea 7:8
.
Strangers devour his strength, Yet he does not know it; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know it. -- hosea 7:9
.
Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they have not returned to the LORD their God, Nor have they sought Him, for all this. -- hosea 7:10
.
So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without sense; They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. -- hosea 7:11
.
When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their assembly. -- hosea 7:12
.
Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me. -- hosea 7:13
.
And they do not cry to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn away from Me. -- hosea 7:14
.
Although I trained and strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me. -- hosea 7:15
.
They turn, but not upward, They are like a deceitful bow; Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the insolence of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt. -- hosea 7:16
.
Put the trumpet to your lips! Like an eagle the enemy comes against the house of the LORD, Because they have transgressed My covenant And rebelled against My law. -- hosea 8:1
.
They cry out to Me, "My God, we of Israel know You!" -- hosea 8:2
.
Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him. -- hosea 8:3
.
They have set up kings, but not by Me; They have appointed princes, but I did not know it. With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, That they might be cut off. -- hosea 8:4
.
He has rejected your calf, O Samaria, saying, "My anger burns against them!" How long will they be incapable of innocence? -- hosea 8:5
.
For from Israel is even this! A craftsman made it, so it is not God; Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces. -- hosea 8:6
.
For they sow the wind And they reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers would swallow it up. -- hosea 8:7
.
Israel is swallowed up; They are now among the nations Like a vessel in which no one delights. -- hosea 8:8
.
For they have gone up to Assyria, Like a wild donkey all alone; Ephraim has hired lovers. -- hosea 8:9
.
Even though they hire allies among the nations, Now I will gather them up; And they will begin to diminish Because of the burden of the king of princes. -- hosea 8:10
.
Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, They have become altars of sinning for him. -- hosea 8:11
.
Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My law, They are regarded as a strange thing. -- hosea 8:12
.
As for My sacrificial gifts, They sacrifice the flesh and eat it, But the LORD has taken no delight in them. Now He will remember their iniquity, And punish them for their sins; They will return to Egypt. -- hosea 8:13
.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; And Judah has multiplied fortified cities, But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial dwellings. -- hosea 8:14
.
Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations! For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved harlots' earnings on every threshing floor. -- hosea 9:1
.
Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail them. -- hosea 9:2
.
They will not remain in the LORD'S land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean food. -- hosea 9:3
.
They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD, Their sacrifices will not please Him. Their bread will be like mourners' bread; All who eat of it will be defiled, For their bread will be for themselves alone; It will not enter the house of the LORD. -- hosea 9:4
.
What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD? -- hosea 9:5
.
For behold, they will go because of destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns will be in their tents. -- hosea 9:6
.
The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; Let Israel know this! The prophet is a fool, The inspired man is demented, Because of the grossness of your iniquity, And because your hostility is so great. -- hosea 9:7
.
Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a prophet; Yet the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, And there is only hostility in the house of his God. -- hosea 9:8
.
They have gone deep in depravity As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins. -- hosea 9:9
.
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season. But they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame, And they became as detestable as that which they loved. -- hosea 9:10
.
As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy and no conception! -- hosea 9:11
.
Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left. Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them! -- hosea 9:12
.
Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter. -- hosea 9:13
.
Give them, O LORD--what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- hosea 9:14
.
All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels. -- hosea 9:15
.
Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they bear children, I will slay the precious ones of their womb. -- hosea 9:16
.
My God will cast them away Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations. -- hosea 9:17
.
Israel is a luxuriant vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made; The richer his land, The better he made the sacred pillars. -- hosea 10:1
.
Their heart is faithless; Now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars And destroy their sacred pillars. -- hosea 10:2
.
Surely now they will say, "We have no king, For we do not revere the LORD. As for the king, what can he do for us?" -- hosea 10:3
.
They speak mere words, With worthless oaths they make covenants; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field. -- hosea 10:4
.
The inhabitants of Samaria will fear For the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn for it, And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it, Over its glory, since it has departed from it. -- hosea 10:5
.
The thing itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to King Jareb; Ephraim will be seized with shame And Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel. -- hosea 10:6
.
Samaria will be cut off with her king Like a stick on the surface of the water. -- hosea 10:7
.
Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars; Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!" -- hosea 10:8
.
From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; There they stand! Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah? -- hosea 10:9
.
When it is My desire, I will chastise them; And the peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound for their double guilt. -- hosea 10:10
.
Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, But I will come over her fair neck with a yoke; I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, Jacob will harrow for himself. -- hosea 10:11
.
Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD Until He comes to rain righteousness on you. -- hosea 10:12
.
You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your way, in your numerous warriors, -- hosea 10:13
.
Therefore a tumult will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, When mothers were dashed in pieces with their children. -- hosea 10:14
.
Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off. -- hosea 10:15
.
When Israel was a youth I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son. -- hosea 11:1
.
The more they called them, The more they went from them; They kept sacrificing to the Baals And burning incense to idols. -- hosea 11:2
.
Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them in My arms; But they did not know that I healed them. -- hosea 11:3
.
I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love, And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; And I bent down and fed them. -- hosea 11:4
.
They will not return to the land of Egypt; But Assyria--he will be their king Because they refused to return to Me. -- hosea 11:5
.
The sword will whirl against their cities, And will demolish their gate bars And consume them because of their counsels. -- hosea 11:6
.
So My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call them to the One on high, None at all exalts Him. -- hosea 11:7
.
How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned over within Me, All My compassions are kindled. -- hosea 11:8
.
I will not execute My fierce anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst, And I will not come in wrath. -- hosea 11:9
.
They will walk after the LORD, He will roar like a lion; Indeed He will roar And His sons will come trembling from the west. -- hosea 11:10
.
They will come trembling like birds from Egypt And like doves from the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses, declares the LORD. -- hosea 11:11
.
Ephraim surrounds Me with lies And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah is also unruly against God, Even against the Holy One who is faithful. -- hosea 11:12
.
Ephraim feeds on wind, And pursues the east wind continually; He multiplies lies and violence. Moreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria, And oil is carried to Egypt. -- hosea 12:1
.
The LORD also has a dispute with Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds. -- hosea 12:2
.
In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his maturity he contended with God. -- hosea 12:3
.
Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept and sought His favor. He found Him at Bethel And there He spoke with us, -- hosea 12:4
.
Even the LORD, the God of hosts, The LORD is His name. -- hosea 12:5
.
Therefore, return to your God, Observe kindness and justice, And wait for your God continually. -- hosea 12:6
.
A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, He loves to oppress. -- hosea 12:7
.
And Ephraim said, "Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors they will find in me No iniquity, which would be sin." -- hosea 12:8
.
But I have been the LORD your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed festival. -- hosea 12:9
.
I have also spoken to the prophets, And I gave numerous visions, And through the prophets I gave parables. -- hosea 12:10
.
Is there iniquity in Gilead? Surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, Yes, their altars are like the stone heaps Beside the furrows of the field. -- hosea 12:11
.
Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram, And Israel worked for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep. -- hosea 12:12
.
But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel from Egypt, And by a prophet he was kept. -- hosea 12:13
.
Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him And bring back his reproach to him. -- hosea 12:14
.
When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, But through Baal he did wrong and died. -- hosea 13:1
.
And now they sin more and more, And make for themselves molten images, Idols skillfully made from their silver, All of them the work of craftsmen. They say of them, "Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves!" -- hosea 13:2
.
Therefore they will be like the morning cloud And like dew which soon disappears, Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floor And like smoke from a chimney. -- hosea 13:3
.
Yet I have been the LORD your God Since the land of Egypt; And you were not to know any god except Me, For there is no savior besides Me. -- hosea 13:4
.
I cared for you in the wilderness, In the land of drought. -- hosea 13:5
.
As they had their pasture, they became satisfied, And being satisfied, their heart became proud; Therefore they forgot Me. -- hosea 13:6
.
So I will be like a lion to them; Like a leopard I will lie in wait by the wayside. -- hosea 13:7
.
I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs, And I will tear open their chests; There I will also devour them like a lioness, As a wild beast would tear them. -- hosea 13:8
.
It is your destruction, O Israel, That you are against Me, against your help. -- hosea 13:9
.
Where now is your king That he may save you in all your cities, And your judges of whom you requested, "Give me a king and princes"? -- hosea 13:10
.
I gave you a king in My anger And took him away in My wrath. -- hosea 13:11
.
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; His sin is stored up. -- hosea 13:12
.
The pains of childbirth come upon him; He is not a wise son, For it is not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb. -- hosea 13:13
.
Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from death? O Death, where are your thorns? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion will be hidden from My sight. -- hosea 13:14
.
Though he flourishes among the reeds, An east wind will come, The wind of the LORD coming up from the wilderness; And his fountain will become dry And his spring will be dried up; It will plunder his treasury of every precious article. -- hosea 13:15
.
Samaria will be held guilty, For she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword, Their little ones will be dashed in pieces, And their pregnant women will be ripped open. -- hosea 13:16
.
Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity. -- hosea 14:1
.
Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity And receive us graciously, That we may present the fruit of our lips. -- hosea 14:2
.
"Assyria will not save us, We will not ride on horses; Nor will we say again, 'Our god,' To the work of our hands; For in You the orphan finds mercy." -- hosea 14:3
.
I will heal their apostasy, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from them. -- hosea 14:4
.
I will be like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily, And he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon. -- hosea 14:5
.
His shoots will sprout, And his beauty will be like the olive tree And his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon. -- hosea 14:6
.
Those who live in his shadow Will again raise grain, And they will blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon. -- hosea 14:7
.
O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; From Me comes your fruit. -- hosea 14:8
.
Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; Whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the righteous will walk in them, But transgressors will stumble in them. -- hosea 14:9
.
The word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel: -- joel 1:1
.
Hear this, O elders, And listen, all inhabitants of the land. Has anything like this happened in your days Or in your fathers' days? -- joel 1:2
.
Tell your sons about it, And let your sons tell their sons, And their sons the next generation. -- joel 1:3
.
What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten; And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten. -- joel 1:4
.
Awake, drunkards, and weep; And wail, all you wine drinkers, On account of the sweet wine That is cut off from your mouth. -- joel 1:5
.
For a nation has invaded my land, Mighty and without number; Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, And it has the fangs of a lioness. -- joel 1:6
.
It has made my vine a waste And my fig tree splinters. It has stripped them bare and cast them away; Their branches have become white. -- joel 1:7
.
Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the bridegroom of her youth. -- joel 1:8
.
The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off From the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, The ministers of the LORD. -- joel 1:9
.
The field is ruined, The land mourns; For the grain is ruined, The new wine dries up, Fresh oil fails. -- joel 1:10
.
Be ashamed, O farmers, Wail, O vinedressers, For the wheat and the barley; Because the harvest of the field is destroyed. -- joel 1:11
.
The vine dries up And the fig tree fails; The pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree, All the trees of the field dry up. Indeed, rejoicing dries up From the sons of men. -- joel 1:12
.
Gird yourselves with sackcloth And lament, O priests; Wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth O ministers of my God, For the grain offering and the drink offering Are withheld from the house of your God. -- joel 1:13
.
Consecrate a fast, Proclaim a solemn assembly; Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the land To the house of the LORD your God, And cry out to the LORD. -- joel 1:14
.
Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, And it will come as destruction from the Almighty. -- joel 1:15
.
Has not food been cut off before our eyes, Gladness and joy from the house of our God? -- joel 1:16
.
The seeds shrivel under their clods; The storehouses are desolate, The barns are torn down, For the grain is dried up. -- joel 1:17
.
How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle wander aimlessly Because there is no pasture for them; Even the flocks of sheep suffer. -- joel 1:18
.
To You, O LORD, I cry; For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field. -- joel 1:19
.
Even the beasts of the field pant for You; For the water brooks are dried up And fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness. -- joel 1:20
.
Blow a trumpet in Zion, And sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, For the day of the LORD is coming; Surely it is near, -- joel 2:1
.
A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness. As the dawn is spread over the mountains, So there is a great and mighty people; There has never been anything like it, Nor will there be again after it To the years of many generations. -- joel 2:2
.
A fire consumes before them And behind them a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them But a desolate wilderness behind them, And nothing at all escapes them. -- joel 2:3
.
Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; And like war horses, so they run. -- joel 2:4
.
With a noise as of chariots They leap on the tops of the mountains, Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble, Like a mighty people arranged for battle. -- joel 2:5
.
Before them the people are in anguish; All faces turn pale. -- joel 2:6
.
They run like mighty men, They climb the wall like soldiers; And they each march in line, Nor do they deviate from their paths. -- joel 2:7
.
They do not crowd each other, They march everyone in his path; When they burst through the defenses, They do not break ranks. -- joel 2:8
.
They rush on the city, They run on the wall; They climb into the houses, They enter through the windows like a thief. -- joel 2:9
.
Before them the earth quakes, The heavens tremble, The sun and the moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness. -- joel 2:10
.
The LORD utters His voice before His army; Surely His camp is very great, For strong is he who carries out His word. The day of the LORD is indeed great and very awesome, And who can endure it? -- joel 2:11
.
"Yet even now," declares the LORD, "Return to Me with all your heart, And with fasting, weeping and mourning; -- joel 2:12
.
And rend your heart and not your garments." Now return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness And relenting of evil. -- joel 2:13
.
Who knows whether He will not turn and relent And leave a blessing behind Him, Even a grain offering and a drink offering For the LORD your God? -- joel 2:14
.
Blow a trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, -- joel 2:15
.
Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and the nursing infants. Let the bridegroom come out of his room And the bride out of her bridal chamber. -- joel 2:16
.
Let the priests, the LORD'S ministers, Weep between the porch and the altar, And let them say, "Spare Your people, O LORD, And do not make Your inheritance a reproach, A byword among the nations. Why should they among the peoples say, 'Where is their God?'" -- joel 2:17
.
Then the LORD will be zealous for His land And will have pity on His people. -- joel 2:18
.
The LORD will answer and say to His people, "Behold, I am going to send you grain, new wine and oil, And you will be satisfied in full with them; And I will never again make you a reproach among the nations. -- joel 2:19
.
"But I will remove the northern army far from you, And I will drive it into a parched and desolate land, And its vanguard into the eastern sea, And its rear guard into the western sea. And its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up, For it has done great things." -- joel 2:20
.
Do not fear, O land, rejoice and be glad, For the LORD has done great things. -- joel 2:21
.
Do not fear, beasts of the field, For the pastures of the wilderness have turned green, For the tree has borne its fruit, The fig tree and the vine have yielded in full. -- joel 2:22
.
So rejoice, O sons of Zion, And be glad in the LORD your God; For He has given you the early rain for your vindication. And He has poured down for you the rain, The early and latter rain as before. -- joel 2:23
.
The threshing floors will be full of grain, And the vats will overflow with the new wine and oil. -- joel 2:24
.
"Then I will make up to you for the years That the swarming locust has eaten, The creeping locust, the stripping locust and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent among you. -- joel 2:25
.
"You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied And praise the name of the LORD your God, Who has dealt wondrously with you; Then My people will never be put to shame. -- joel 2:26
.
"Thus you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, And that I am the LORD your God, And there is no other; And My people will never be put to shame. -- joel 2:27
.
"It will come about after this That I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men will dream dreams, Your young men will see visions. -- joel 2:28
.
"Even on the male and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days. -- joel 2:29
.
"I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth, Blood, fire and columns of smoke. -- joel 2:30
.
"The sun will be turned into darkness And the moon into blood Before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. -- joel 2:31
.
"And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the LORD Will be delivered; For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem There will be those who escape, As the LORD has said, Even among the survivors whom the LORD calls. -- joel 2:32
.
"For behold, in those days and at that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, -- joel 3:1
.
I will gather all the nations And bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My land. -- joel 3:2
.
"They have also cast lots for My people, Traded a boy for a harlot And sold a girl for wine that they may drink. -- joel 3:3
.
"Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre, Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering Me a recompense? But if you do recompense Me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head. -- joel 3:4
.
"Since you have taken My silver and My gold, brought My precious treasures to your temples, -- joel 3:5
.
and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their territory, -- joel 3:6
.
behold, I am going to arouse them from the place where you have sold them, and return your recompense on your head. -- joel 3:7
.
"Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation," for the LORD has spoken. -- joel 3:8
.
Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare a war; rouse the mighty men! Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up! -- joel 3:9
.
Beat your plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, "I am a mighty man." -- joel 3:10
.
Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves there. Bring down, O LORD, Your mighty ones. -- joel 3:11
.
Let the nations be aroused And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I will sit to judge All the surrounding nations. -- joel 3:12
.
Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the wine press is full; The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great. -- joel 3:13
.
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. -- joel 3:14
.
The sun and moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness. -- joel 3:15
.
The LORD roars from Zion And utters His voice from Jerusalem, And the heavens and the earth tremble. But the LORD is a refuge for His people And a stronghold to the sons of Israel. -- joel 3:16
.
Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. So Jerusalem will be holy, And strangers will pass through it no more. -- joel 3:17
.
And in that day The mountains will drip with sweet wine, And the hills will flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water; And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD To water the valley of Shittim. -- joel 3:18
.
Egypt will become a waste, And Edom will become a desolate wilderness, Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, In whose land they have shed innocent blood. -- joel 3:19
.
But Judah will be inhabited forever And Jerusalem for all generations. -- joel 3:20
.
And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged, For the LORD dwells in Zion. -- joel 3:21
.
The words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders from Tekoa, which he envisioned in visions concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. -- amos 1:1
.
He said, "The LORD roars from Zion And from Jerusalem He utters His voice; And the shepherds' pasture grounds mourn, And the summit of Carmel dries up." -- amos 1:2
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Damascus and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they threshed Gilead with implements of sharp iron. -- amos 1:3
.
"So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael And it will consume the citadels of Ben-hadad. -- amos 1:4
.
"I will also break the gate bar of Damascus, And cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, And him who holds the scepter, from Beth-eden; So the people of Aram will go exiled to Kir," Says the LORD. -- amos 1:5
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Gaza and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they deported an entire population To deliver it up to Edom. -- amos 1:6
.
"So I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza And it will consume her citadels. -- amos 1:7
.
"I will also cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, And him who holds the scepter, from Ashkelon; I will even unleash My power upon Ekron, And the remnant of the Philistines will perish," Says the Lord GOD. -- amos 1:8
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Tyre and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they delivered up an entire population to Edom And did not remember the covenant of brotherhood. -- amos 1:9
.
"So I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre And it will consume her citadels." -- amos 1:10
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Edom and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because he pursued his brother with the sword, While he stifled his compassion; His anger also tore continually, And he maintained his fury forever. -- amos 1:11
.
"So I will send fire upon Teman And it will consume the citadels of Bozrah." -- amos 1:12
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead In order to enlarge their borders. -- amos 1:13
.
"So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah And it will consume her citadels Amid war cries on the day of battle, And a storm on the day of tempest. -- amos 1:14
.
"Their king will go into exile, He and his princes together," says the LORD. -- amos 1:15
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Moab and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime. -- amos 2:1
.
"So I will send fire upon Moab And it will consume the citadels of Kerioth; And Moab will die amid tumult, With war cries and the sound of a trumpet. -- amos 2:2
.
"I will also cut off the judge from her midst And slay all her princes with him," says the LORD. -- amos 2:3
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Judah and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they rejected the law of the LORD And have not kept His statutes; Their lies also have led them astray, Those after which their fathers walked. -- amos 2:4
.
"So I will send fire upon Judah And it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem." -- amos 2:5
.
Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Israel and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they sell the righteous for money And the needy for a pair of sandals. -- amos 2:6
.
"These who pant after the very dust of the earth on the head of the helpless Also turn aside the way of the humble; And a man and his father resort to the same girl In order to profane My holy name. -- amos 2:7
.
"On garments taken as pledges they stretch out beside every altar, And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined. -- amos 2:8
.
"Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, Though his height was like the height of cedars And he was strong as the oaks; I even destroyed his fruit above and his root below. -- amos 2:9
.
"It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt, And I led you in the wilderness forty years That you might take possession of the land of the Amorite. -- amos 2:10
.
"Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophets And some of your young men to be Nazirites. Is this not so, O sons of Israel?" declares the LORD. -- amos 2:11
.
"But you made the Nazirites drink wine, And you commanded the prophets saying, 'You shall not prophesy!' -- amos 2:12
.
"Behold, I am weighted down beneath you As a wagon is weighted down when filled with sheaves. -- amos 2:13
.
"Flight will perish from the swift, And the stalwart will not strengthen his power, Nor the mighty man save his life. -- amos 2:14
.
"He who grasps the bow will not stand his ground, The swift of foot will not escape, Nor will he who rides the horse save his life. -- amos 2:15
.
"Even the bravest among the warriors will flee naked in that day," declares the LORD. -- amos 2:16
.
Hear this word which the LORD has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt: -- amos 3:1
.
"You only have I chosen among all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." -- amos 3:2
.
Do two men walk together unless they have made an appointment? -- amos 3:3
.
Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has captured something? -- amos 3:4
.
Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no bait in it? Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all? -- amos 3:5
.
If a trumpet is blown in a city will not the people tremble? If a calamity occurs in a city has not the LORD done it? -- amos 3:6
.
Surely the Lord GOD does nothing Unless He reveals His secret counsel To His servants the prophets. -- amos 3:7
.
A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken! Who can but prophesy? -- amos 3:8
.
Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt and say, "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see the great tumults within her and the oppressions in her midst. -- amos 3:9
.
"But they do not know how to do what is right," declares the LORD, "these who hoard up violence and devastation in their citadels." -- amos 3:10
.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "An enemy, even one surrounding the land, Will pull down your strength from you And your citadels will be looted." -- amos 3:11
.
Thus says the LORD, "Just as the shepherd snatches from the lion's mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear, So will the sons of Israel dwelling in Samaria be snatched away-- With the corner of a bed and the cover of a couch! -- amos 3:12
.
"Hear and testify against the house of Jacob," Declares the Lord GOD, the God of hosts. -- amos 3:13
.
"For on the day that I punish Israel's transgressions, I will also punish the altars of Bethel; The horns of the altar will be cut off And they will fall to the ground. -- amos 3:14
.
"I will also smite the winter house together with the summer house; The houses of ivory will also perish And the great houses will come to an end," Declares the LORD. -- amos 3:15
.
Hear this word, you cows of Bashan who are on the mountain of Samaria, Who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, Who say to your husbands, "Bring now, that we may drink!" -- amos 4:1
.
The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness, "Behold, the days are coming upon you When they will take you away with meat hooks, And the last of you with fish hooks. -- amos 4:2
.
"You will go out through breaches in the walls, Each one straight before her, And you will be cast to Harmon," declares the LORD. -- amos 4:3
.
"Enter Bethel and transgress; In Gilgal multiply transgression! Bring your sacrifices every morning, Your tithes every three days. -- amos 4:4
.
"Offer a thank offering also from that which is leavened, And proclaim freewill offerings, make them known. For so you love to do, you sons of Israel," Declares the Lord GOD. -- amos 4:5
.
"But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities And lack of bread in all your places, Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. -- amos 4:6
.
"Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While there were still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city And on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up. -- amos 4:7
.
"So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. -- amos 4:8
.
"I smote you with scorching wind and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. -- amos 4:9
.
"I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. -- amos 4:10
.
"I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD. -- amos 4:11
.
"Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel; Because I will do this to you, Prepare to meet your God, O Israel." -- amos 4:12
.
For behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind And declares to man what are His thoughts, He who makes dawn into darkness And treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD God of hosts is His name. -- amos 4:13
.
Hear this word which I take up for you as a dirge, O house of Israel: -- amos 5:1
.
She has fallen, she will not rise again-- The virgin Israel. She lies neglected on her land; There is none to raise her up. -- amos 5:2
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "The city which goes forth a thousand strong Will have a hundred left, And the one which goes forth a hundred strong Will have ten left to the house of Israel." -- amos 5:3
.
For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel, "Seek Me that you may live. -- amos 5:4
.
"But do not resort to Bethel And do not come to Gilgal, Nor cross over to Beersheba; For Gilgal will certainly go into captivity And Bethel will come to trouble. -- amos 5:5
.
"Seek the LORD that you may live, Or He will break forth like a fire, O house of Joseph, And it will consume with none to quench it for Bethel, -- amos 5:6
.
For those who turn justice into wormwood And cast righteousness down to the earth." -- amos 5:7
.
He who made the Pleiades and Orion And changes deep darkness into morning, Who also darkens day into night, Who calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the surface of the earth, The LORD is His name. -- amos 5:8
.
It is He who flashes forth with destruction upon the strong, So that destruction comes upon the fortress. -- amos 5:9
.
They hate him who reproves in the gate, And they abhor him who speaks with integrity. -- amos 5:10
.
Therefore because you impose heavy rent on the poor And exact a tribute of grain from them, Though you have built houses of well-hewn stone, Yet you will not live in them; You have planted pleasant vineyards, yet you will not drink their wine. -- amos 5:11
.
For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are great, You who distress the righteous and accept bribes And turn aside the poor in the gate. -- amos 5:12
.
Therefore at such a time the prudent person keeps silent, for it is an evil time. -- amos 5:13
.
Seek good and not evil, that you may live; And thus may the LORD God of hosts be with you, Just as you have said! -- amos 5:14
.
Hate evil, love good, And establish justice in the gate! Perhaps the LORD God of hosts May be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. -- amos 5:15
.
Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, the Lord, "There is wailing in all the plazas, And in all the streets they say, 'Alas! Alas!' They also call the farmer to mourning And professional mourners to lamentation. -- amos 5:16
.
"And in all the vineyards there is wailing, Because I will pass through the midst of you," says the LORD. -- amos 5:17
.
Alas, you who are longing for the day of the LORD, For what purpose will the day of the LORD be to you? It will be darkness and not light; -- amos 5:18
.
As when a man flees from a lion And a bear meets him, Or goes home, leans his hand against the wall And a snake bites him. -- amos 5:19
.
Will not the day of the LORD be darkness instead of light, Even gloom with no brightness in it? -- amos 5:20
.
"I hate, I reject your festivals, Nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies. -- amos 5:21
.
"Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept them; And I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings. -- amos 5:22
.
"Take away from Me the noise of your songs; I will not even listen to the sound of your harps. -- amos 5:23
.
"But let justice roll down like waters And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream. -- amos 5:24
.
"Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel? -- amos 5:25
.
"You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves. -- amos 5:26
.
"Therefore, I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus," says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts. -- amos 5:27
.
Woe to those who are at ease in Zion And to those who feel secure in the mountain of Samaria, The distinguished men of the foremost of nations, To whom the house of Israel comes. -- amos 6:1
.
Go over to Calneh and look, And go from there to Hamath the great, Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms, Or is their territory greater than yours? -- amos 6:2
.
Do you put off the day of calamity, And would you bring near the seat of violence? -- amos 6:3
.
Those who recline on beds of ivory And sprawl on their couches, And eat lambs from the flock And calves from the midst of the stall, -- amos 6:4
.
Who improvise to the sound of the harp, And like David have composed songs for themselves, -- amos 6:5
.
Who drink wine from sacrificial bowls While they anoint themselves with the finest of oils, Yet they have not grieved over the ruin of Joseph. -- amos 6:6
.
Therefore, they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles, And the sprawlers' banqueting will pass away. -- amos 6:7
.
The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself, the LORD God of hosts has declared: "I loathe the arrogance of Jacob, And detest his citadels; Therefore I will deliver up the city and all it contains." -- amos 6:8
.
And it will be, if ten men are left in one house, they will die. -- amos 6:9
.
Then one's uncle, or his undertaker, will lift him up to carry out his bones from the house, and he will say to the one who is in the innermost part of the house, "Is anyone else with you?" And that one will say, "No one." Then he will answer, "Keep quiet. For the name of the LORD is not to be mentioned." -- amos 6:10
.
For behold, the LORD is going to command that the great house be smashed to pieces and the small house to fragments. -- amos 6:11
.
Do horses run on rocks? Or does one plow them with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood, -- amos 6:12
.
You who rejoice in Lodebar, And say, "Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?" -- amos 6:13
.
"For behold, I am going to raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel," declares the LORD God of hosts, "And they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath To the brook of the Arabah." -- amos 6:14
.
Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, He was forming a locust-swarm when the spring crop began to sprout. And behold, the spring crop was after the king's mowing. -- amos 7:1
.
And it came about, when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land, that I said, "Lord GOD, please pardon! How can Jacob stand, For he is small?" -- amos 7:2
.
The LORD changed His mind about this. "It shall not be," said the LORD. -- amos 7:3
.
Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, the Lord GOD was calling to contend with them by fire, and it consumed the great deep and began to consume the farm land. -- amos 7:4
.
Then I said, "Lord GOD, please stop! How can Jacob stand, for he is small?" -- amos 7:5
.
The LORD changed His mind about this. "This too shall not be," said the Lord GOD. -- amos 7:6
.
Thus He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand. -- amos 7:7
.
The LORD said to me, "What do you see, Amos?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "Behold I am about to put a plumb line In the midst of My people Israel. I will spare them no longer. -- amos 7:8
.
"The high places of Isaac will be desolated And the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste. Then I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword." -- amos 7:9
.
Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words. -- amos 7:10
.
"For thus Amos says, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'" -- amos 7:11
.
Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Go, you seer, flee away to the land of Judah and there eat bread and there do your prophesying! -- amos 7:12
.
"But no longer prophesy at Bethel, for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal residence." -- amos 7:13
.
