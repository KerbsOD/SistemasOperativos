Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, "These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation." -- acts 16:17
.
She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out at that very moment. -- acts 16:18
.
But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities, -- acts 16:19
.
and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews, -- acts 16:20
.
and are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans." -- acts 16:21
.
The crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods. -- acts 16:22
.
When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely; -- acts 16:23
.
and he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. -- acts 16:24
.
But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them; -- acts 16:25
.
and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened. -- acts 16:26
.
When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. -- acts 16:27
.
But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!" -- acts 16:28
.
And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas, -- acts 16:29
.
and after he brought them out, he said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" -- acts 16:30
.
They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household." -- acts 16:31
.
And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house. -- acts 16:32
.
And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household. -- acts 16:33
.
And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household. -- acts 16:34
.
Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen, saying, "Release those men." -- acts 16:35
.
And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace." -- acts 16:36
.
But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they sending us away secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out." -- acts 16:37
.
The policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans, -- acts 16:38
.
and they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city. -- acts 16:39
.
They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed. -- acts 16:40
.
Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. -- acts 17:1
.
And according to Paul's custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, -- acts 17:2
.
explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ." -- acts 17:3
.
And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women. -- acts 17:4
.
But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and attacking the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the people. -- acts 17:5
.
When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have come here also; -- acts 17:6
.
and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus." -- acts 17:7
.
They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things. -- acts 17:8
.
And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them. -- acts 17:9
.
The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. -- acts 17:10
.
Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. -- acts 17:11
.
Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men. -- acts 17:12
.
But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds. -- acts 17:13
.
Then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there. -- acts 17:14
.
Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left. -- acts 17:15
.
Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols. -- acts 17:16
.
So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present. -- acts 17:17
.
And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some were saying, "What would this idle babbler wish to say?" Others, "He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,"--because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. -- acts 17:18
.
And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming? -- acts 17:19
.
"For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean." -- acts 17:20
.
(Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.) -- acts 17:21
.
So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects. -- acts 17:22
.
"For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you. -- acts 17:23
.
"The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; -- acts 17:24
.
nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things; -- acts 17:25
.
and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, -- acts 17:26
.
that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; -- acts 17:27
.
for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are His children.' -- acts 17:28
.
"Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man. -- acts 17:29
.
"Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, -- acts 17:30
.
because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead." -- acts 17:31
.
Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer, but others said, "We shall hear you again concerning this." -- acts 17:32
.
So Paul went out of their midst. -- acts 17:33
.
But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. -- acts 17:34
.
After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth. -- acts 18:1
.
And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them, -- acts 18:2
.
and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers. -- acts 18:3
.
And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks. -- acts 18:4
.
But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. -- acts 18:5
.
But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." -- acts 18:6
.
Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue. -- acts 18:7
.
Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized. -- acts 18:8
.
And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent; -- acts 18:9
.
for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in this city." -- acts 18:10
.
And he settled there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. -- acts 18:11
.
But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat, -- acts 18:12
.
saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law." -- acts 18:13
.
But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you; -- acts 18:14
.
but if there are questions about words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters." -- acts 18:15
.
And he drove them away from the judgment seat. -- acts 18:16
.
And they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things. -- acts 18:17
.
Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow. -- acts 18:18
.
They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. -- acts 18:19
.
When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent, -- acts 18:20
.
but taking leave of them and saying, "I will return to you again if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus. -- acts 18:21
.
When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch. -- acts 18:22
.
And having spent some time there, he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. -- acts 18:23
.
Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures. -- acts 18:24
.
This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John; -- acts 18:25
.
and he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. -- acts 18:26
.
And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace, -- acts 18:27
.
for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. -- acts 18:28
.
It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples. -- acts 19:1
.
He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they said to him, "No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit." -- acts 19:2
.
And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John's baptism." -- acts 19:3
.
Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus." -- acts 19:4
.
When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. -- acts 19:5
.
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying. -- acts 19:6
.
There were in all about twelve men. -- acts 19:7
.
And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. -- acts 19:8
.
But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. -- acts 19:9
.
This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. -- acts 19:10
.
God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, -- acts 19:11
.
so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out. -- acts 19:12
.
But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches." -- acts 19:13
.
Seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. -- acts 19:14
.
And the evil spirit answered and said to them, "I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?" -- acts 19:15
.
And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. -- acts 19:16
.
This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified. -- acts 19:17
.
Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices. -- acts 19:18
.
And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and began burning them in the sight of everyone; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. -- acts 19:19
.
So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing. -- acts 19:20
.
Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome." -- acts 19:21
.
And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while. -- acts 19:22
.
About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way. -- acts 19:23
.
For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen; -- acts 19:24
.
these he gathered together with the workmen of similar trades, and said, "Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business. -- acts 19:25
.
"You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all. -- acts 19:26
.
"Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence." -- acts 19:27
.
When they heard this and were filled with rage, they began crying out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" -- acts 19:28
.
The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia. -- acts 19:29
.
And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him. -- acts 19:30
.
Also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture into the theater. -- acts 19:31
.
So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together. -- acts 19:32
.
Some of the crowd concluded it was Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward; and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly. -- acts 19:33
.
But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" -- acts 19:34
.
After quieting the crowd, the town clerk *said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven? -- acts 19:35
.
"So, since these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash. -- acts 19:36
.
"For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess. -- acts 19:37
.
"So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and proconsuls are available; let them bring charges against one another. -- acts 19:38
.
"But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly. -- acts 19:39
.
"For indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today's events, since there is no real cause for it, and in this connection we will be unable to account for this disorderly gathering." -- acts 19:40
.
After saying this he dismissed the assembly. -- acts 19:41
.
After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to Macedonia. -- acts 20:1
.
When he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation, he came to Greece. -- acts 20:2
.
And there he spent three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. -- acts 20:3
.
And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia. -- acts 20:4
.
But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas. -- acts 20:5
.
We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days. -- acts 20:6
.
On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight. -- acts 20:7
.
There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together. -- acts 20:8
.
And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead. -- acts 20:9
.
But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him." -- acts 20:10
.
When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left. -- acts 20:11
.
They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted. -- acts 20:12
.
But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for so he had arranged it, intending himself to go by land. -- acts 20:13
.
And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene. -- acts 20:14
.
Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus. -- acts 20:15
.
For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost. -- acts 20:16
.
From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church. -- acts 20:17
.
And when they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time, -- acts 20:18
.
serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews; -- acts 20:19
.
how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house, -- acts 20:20
.
solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. -- acts 20:21
.
"And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there, -- acts 20:22
.
except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me. -- acts 20:23
.
"But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God. -- acts 20:24
.
"And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face. -- acts 20:25
.
"Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. -- acts 20:26
.
"For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God. -- acts 20:27
.
"Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. -- acts 20:28
.
"I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; -- acts 20:29
.
and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. -- acts 20:30
.
"Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears. -- acts 20:31
.
"And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. -- acts 20:32
.
"I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes. -- acts 20:33
.
"You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me. -- acts 20:34
.
"In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'" -- acts 20:35
.
When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. -- acts 20:36
.
And they began to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him, -- acts 20:37
.
grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the ship. -- acts 20:38
.
When we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara; -- acts 21:1
.
and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. -- acts 21:2
.
When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo. -- acts 21:3
.
After looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem. -- acts 21:4
.
When our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another. -- acts 21:5
.
Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home again. -- acts 21:6
.
When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for a day. -- acts 21:7
.
On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him. -- acts 21:8
.
Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses. -- acts 21:9
.
As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. -- acts 21:10
.
And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'" -- acts 21:11
.
When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem. -- acts 21:12
.
Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." -- acts 21:13
.
And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, "The will of the Lord be done!" -- acts 21:14
.
After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem. -- acts 21:15
.
Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge. -- acts 21:16
.
After we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. -- acts 21:17
.
And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. -- acts 21:18
.
After he had greeted them, he began to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. -- acts 21:19
.
And when they heard it they began glorifying God; and they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law; -- acts 21:20
.
and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs. -- acts 21:21
.
"What, then, is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. -- acts 21:22
.
"Therefore do this that we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; -- acts 21:23
.
take them and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Law. -- acts 21:24
.
"But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication." -- acts 21:25
.
Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purifying himself along with them, went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them. -- acts 21:26
.
When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, began to stir up all the crowd and laid hands on him, -- acts 21:27
.
crying out, "Men of Israel, come to our aid! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place." -- acts 21:28
.
For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. -- acts 21:29
.
Then all the city was provoked, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut. -- acts 21:30
.
While they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. -- acts 21:31
.
At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. -- acts 21:32
.
Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he began asking who he was and what he had done. -- acts 21:33
.
But among the crowd some were shouting one thing and some another, and when he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. -- acts 21:34
.
When he got to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob; -- acts 21:35
.
for the multitude of the people kept following them, shouting, "Away with him!" -- acts 21:36
.
As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, "May I say something to you?" And he *said, "Do you know Greek? -- acts 21:37
.
"Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?" -- acts 21:38
.
But Paul said, "I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people." -- acts 21:39
.
When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying, -- acts 21:40
.
"Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you." -- acts 22:1
.
And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he *said, -- acts 22:2
.
"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today. -- acts 22:3
.
"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons, -- acts 22:4
.
as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished. -- acts 22:5
.
"But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me, -- acts 22:6
.
and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?' -- acts 22:7
.
"And I answered, 'Who are You, Lord?' And He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.' -- acts 22:8
.
"And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me. -- acts 22:9
.
"And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.' -- acts 22:10
.
"But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus. -- acts 22:11
.
"A certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, -- acts 22:12
.
came to me, and standing near said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very time I looked up at him. -- acts 22:13
.
"And he said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth. -- acts 22:14
.
'For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard. -- acts 22:15
.
'Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.' -- acts 22:16
.
"It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance, -- acts 22:17
.
and I saw Him saying to me, 'Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.' -- acts 22:18
.
"And I said, 'Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You. -- acts 22:19
.
'And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him.' -- acts 22:20
.
"And He said to me, 'Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'" -- acts 22:21
.
They listened to him up to this statement, and then they raised their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!" -- acts 22:22
.
And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air, -- acts 22:23
.
the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, stating that he should be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way. -- acts 22:24
.
But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?" -- acts 22:25
.
When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman." -- acts 22:26
.
The commander came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" And he said, "Yes." -- acts 22:27
.
The commander answered, "I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money." And Paul said, "But I was actually born a citizen." -- acts 22:28
.
Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains. -- acts 22:29
.
But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them. -- acts 22:30
.
Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, "Brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God up to this day." -- acts 23:1
.
The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth. -- acts 23:2
.
Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?" -- acts 23:3
.
But the bystanders said, "Do you revile God's high priest?" -- acts 23:4
.
And Paul said, "I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE.'" -- acts 23:5
.
But perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul began crying out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!" -- acts 23:6
.
As he said this, there occurred a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. -- acts 23:7
.
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. -- acts 23:8
.
And there occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and began to argue heatedly, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?" -- acts 23:9
.
And as a great dissension was developing, the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks. -- acts 23:10
.
But on the night immediately following, the Lord stood at his side and said, "Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also." -- acts 23:11
.
When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. -- acts 23:12
.
There were more than forty who formed this plot. -- acts 23:13
.
They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, "We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul. -- acts 23:14
.
"Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case by a more thorough investigation; and we for our part are ready to slay him before he comes near the place." -- acts 23:15
.
But the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul. -- acts 23:16
.
Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, "Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him." -- acts 23:17
.
So he took him and led him to the commander and *said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to lead this young man to you since he has something to tell you." -- acts 23:18
.
The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, began to inquire of him privately, "What is it that you have to report to me?" -- acts 23:19
.
And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him. -- acts 23:20
.
"So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they slay him; and now they are ready and waiting for the promise from you." -- acts 23:21
.
So the commander let the young man go, instructing him, "Tell no one that you have notified me of these things." -- acts 23:22
.
And he called to him two of the centurions and said, "Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen." -- acts 23:23
.
They were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor. -- acts 23:24
.
And he wrote a letter having this form: -- acts 23:25
.
"Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings. -- acts 23:26
.
"When this man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be slain by them, I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. -- acts 23:27
.
"And wanting to ascertain the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Council; -- acts 23:28
.
and I found him to be accused over questions about their Law, but under no accusation deserving death or imprisonment. -- acts 23:29
.
"When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you." -- acts 23:30
.
So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. -- acts 23:31
.
But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks. -- acts 23:32
.
When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. -- acts 23:33
.
When he had read it, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia, -- acts 23:34
.
he said, "I will give you a hearing after your accusers arrive also," giving orders for him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium. -- acts 23:35
.
After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought charges to the governor against Paul. -- acts 24:1
.
After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to the governor, "Since we have through you attained much peace, and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation, -- acts 24:2
.
we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. -- acts 24:3
.
"But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing. -- acts 24:4
.
"For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. -- acts 24:5
.
"And he even tried to desecrate the temple; and then we arrested him. [We wanted to judge him according to our own Law. -- acts 24:6
.
"But Lysias the commander came along, and with much violence took him out of our hands, -- acts 24:7
.
ordering his accusers to come before you.] By examining him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him." -- acts 24:8
.
The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so. -- acts 24:9
.
When the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded: "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense, -- acts 24:10
.
since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. -- acts 24:11
.
"Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city itself did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot. -- acts 24:12
.
"Nor can they prove to you the charges of which they now accuse me. -- acts 24:13
.
"But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets; -- acts 24:14
.
having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. -- acts 24:15
.
"In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and before men. -- acts 24:16
.
"Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings; -- acts 24:17
.
in which they found me occupied in the temple, having been purified, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia-- -- acts 24:18
.
who ought to have been present before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me. -- acts 24:19
.
"Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council, -- acts 24:20
.
other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them, 'For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.'" -- acts 24:21
.
But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case." -- acts 24:22
.
Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him. -- acts 24:23
.
But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. -- acts 24:24
.
But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, "Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you." -- acts 24:25
.
At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him. -- acts 24:26
.
But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned. -- acts 24:27
.
Festus then, having arrived in the province, three days later went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. -- acts 25:1
.
And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul, and they were urging him, -- acts 25:2
.
requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem (at the same time, setting an ambush to kill him on the way). -- acts 25:3
.
Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to leave shortly. -- acts 25:4
.
"Therefore," he *said, "let the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him." -- acts 25:5
.
After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought. -- acts 25:6
.
After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him which they could not prove, -- acts 25:7
.
while Paul said in his own defense, "I have committed no offense either against the Law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar." -- acts 25:8
.
But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these charges?" -- acts 25:9
.
But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know. -- acts 25:10
.
"If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar." -- acts 25:11
.
Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, "You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go." -- acts 25:12
.
Now when several days had elapsed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus. -- acts 25:13
.
While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix; -- acts 25:14
.
and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. -- acts 25:15
.
"I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges. -- acts 25:16
.
"So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought before me. -- acts 25:17
.
"When the accusers stood up, they began bringing charges against him not of such crimes as I was expecting, -- acts 25:18
.
but they simply had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive. -- acts 25:19
.
"Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters. -- acts 25:20
.
"But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I send him to Caesar." -- acts 25:21
.
Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he *said, "you shall hear him." -- acts 25:22
.
So, on the next day when Agrippa came together with Bernice amid great pomp, and entered the auditorium accompanied by the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. -- acts 25:23
.
Festus *said, "King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any longer. -- acts 25:24
.
"But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him. -- acts 25:25
.
"Yet I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write. -- acts 25:26
.
"For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate also the charges against him." -- acts 25:27
.
Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to make his defense: -- acts 26:1
.
"In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today; -- acts 26:2
.
especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently. -- acts 26:3
.
"So then, all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem; -- acts 26:4
.
since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion. -- acts 26:5
.
"And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers; -- acts 26:6
.
the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews. -- acts 26:7
.
"Why is it considered incredible among you people if God does raise the dead? -- acts 26:8
.
"So then, I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. -- acts 26:9
.
"And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them. -- acts 26:10
.
"And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities. -- acts 26:11
.
"While so engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, -- acts 26:12
.
at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining all around me and those who were journeying with me. -- acts 26:13
.
"And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.' -- acts 26:14
.
"And I said, 'Who are You, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. -- acts 26:15
.
'But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you; -- acts 26:16
.
rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you, -- acts 26:17
.
to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.' -- acts 26:18
.
"So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision, -- acts 26:19
.
but kept declaring both to those of Damascus first, and also at Jerusalem and then throughout all the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds appropriate to repentance. -- acts 26:20
.
"For this reason some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death. -- acts 26:21
.
"So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place; -- acts 26:22
.
that the Christ was to suffer, and that by reason of His resurrection from the dead He would be the first to proclaim light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles." -- acts 26:23
.
While Paul was saying this in his defense, Festus *said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad." -- acts 26:24
.
But Paul *said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth. -- acts 26:25
.
"For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner. -- acts 26:26
.
"King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do." -- acts 26:27
.
Agrippa replied to Paul, "In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian." -- acts 26:28
.
And Paul said, "I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains." -- acts 26:29
.
The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them, -- acts 26:30
.
and when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, "This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment." -- acts 26:31
.
And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar." -- acts 26:32
.
When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius. -- acts 27:1
.
And embarking in an Adramyttian ship, which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica. -- acts 27:2
.
The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care. -- acts 27:3
.
From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary. -- acts 27:4
.
When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. -- acts 27:5
.
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it. -- acts 27:6
.
When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us to go farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone; -- acts 27:7
.
and with difficulty sailing past it we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea. -- acts 27:8
.
When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul began to admonish them, -- acts 27:9
.
and said to them, "Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives." -- acts 27:10
.
But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul. -- acts 27:11
.
Because the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there. -- acts 27:12
.
When a moderate south wind came up, supposing that they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, close inshore. -- acts 27:13
.
But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called Euraquilo; -- acts 27:14
.
and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and let ourselves be driven along. -- acts 27:15
.
Running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get the ship's boat under control. -- acts 27:16
.
After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they let down the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along. -- acts 27:17
.
The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo; -- acts 27:18
.
and on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. -- acts 27:19
.
Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned. -- acts 27:20
.
When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up in their midst and said, "Men, you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss. -- acts 27:21
.
"Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. -- acts 27:22
.
"For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me, -- acts 27:23
.
saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.' -- acts 27:24
.
"Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told. -- acts 27:25
.
"But we must run aground on a certain island." -- acts 27:26
.
But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to surmise that they were approaching some land. -- acts 27:27
.
They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms. -- acts 27:28
.
Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak. -- acts 27:29
.
But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the ship's boat into the sea, on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow, -- acts 27:30
.
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men remain in the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved." -- acts 27:31
.
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it fall away. -- acts 27:32
.
Until the day was about to dawn, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing. -- acts 27:33
.
"Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your preservation, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish." -- acts 27:34
.
Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat. -- acts 27:35
.
All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food. -- acts 27:36
.
All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons. -- acts 27:37
.
When they had eaten enough, they began to lighten the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea. -- acts 27:38
.
When day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could. -- acts 27:39
.
And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they were heading for the beach. -- acts 27:40
.
But striking a reef where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to be broken up by the force of the waves. -- acts 27:41
.
The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape; -- acts 27:42
.
but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land, -- acts 27:43
.
and the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land. -- acts 27:44
.
When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta. -- acts 28:1
.
The natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all. -- acts 28:2
.
But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. -- acts 28:3
.
When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, "Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live." -- acts 28:4
.
However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm. -- acts 28:5
.
But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god. -- acts 28:6
.
Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days. -- acts 28:7
.
And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him. -- acts 28:8
.
After this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured. -- acts 28:9
.
They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied us with all we needed. -- acts 28:10
.
At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead. -- acts 28:11
.
After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. -- acts 28:12
.
From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. -- acts 28:13
.
There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and thus we came to Rome. -- acts 28:14
.
And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage. -- acts 28:15
.
When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him. -- acts 28:16
.
After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he began saying to them, "Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. -- acts 28:17
.
"And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death. -- acts 28:18
.
"But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation. -- acts 28:19
.
"For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel." -- acts 28:20
.
They said to him, "We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you. -- acts 28:21
.
"But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere." -- acts 28:22
.
When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening. -- acts 28:23
.
Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe. -- acts 28:24
.
And when they did not agree with one another, they began leaving after Paul had spoken one parting word, "The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers, -- acts 28:25
.
saying, 'GO TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY, "YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; AND YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE; -- acts 28:26
.
FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES; OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM."' -- acts 28:27
.
"Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also listen." -- acts 28:28
.
[When he had spoken these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.] -- acts 28:29
.
And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters and was welcoming all who came to him, -- acts 28:30
.
preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered. -- acts 28:31
.
Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, -- romans 1:1
.
which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, -- romans 1:2
.
concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh, -- romans 1:3
.
who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord, -- romans 1:4
.
through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name's sake, -- romans 1:5
.
among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ; -- romans 1:6
.
to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- romans 1:7
.
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world. -- romans 1:8
.
For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of His Son, is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you, -- romans 1:9
.
always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you. -- romans 1:10
.
For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established; -- romans 1:11
.
that is, that I may be encouraged together with you while among you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine. -- romans 1:12
.
I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles. -- romans 1:13
.
I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. -- romans 1:14
.
So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. -- romans 1:15
.
For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. -- romans 1:16
.
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY FAITH." -- romans 1:17
.
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, -- romans 1:18
.
because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. -- romans 1:19
.
For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. -- romans 1:20
.
For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. -- romans 1:21
.
Professing to be wise, they became fools, -- romans 1:22
.
and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. -- romans 1:23
.
Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. -- romans 1:24
.
For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. -- romans 1:25
.
For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, -- romans 1:26
.
and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. -- romans 1:27
.
And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, -- romans 1:28
.
being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips, -- romans 1:29
.
slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, -- romans 1:30
.
without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; -- romans 1:31
.
and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them. -- romans 1:32
.
Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. -- romans 2:1
.
And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things. -- romans 2:2
.
But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God? -- romans 2:3
.
Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? -- romans 2:4
.
But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, -- romans 2:5
.
who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS: -- romans 2:6
.
to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; -- romans 2:7
.
but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation. -- romans 2:8
.
There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek, -- romans 2:9
.
but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. -- romans 2:10
.
For there is no partiality with God. -- romans 2:11
.
For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law; -- romans 2:12
.
for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified. -- romans 2:13
.
For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, -- romans 2:14
.
in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, -- romans 2:15
.
on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus. -- romans 2:16
.
But if you bear the name "Jew" and rely upon the Law and boast in God, -- romans 2:17
.
and know His will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law, -- romans 2:18
.
and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, -- romans 2:19
.
a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth, -- romans 2:20
.
you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal? -- romans 2:21
.
You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? -- romans 2:22
.
You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God? -- romans 2:23
.
For "THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU," just as it is written. -- romans 2:24
.
For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. -- romans 2:25
.
So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? -- romans 2:26
.
And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law? -- romans 2:27
.
For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. -- romans 2:28
.
But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God. -- romans 2:29
.
Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? -- romans 3:1
.
Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God. -- romans 3:2
.
What then? If some did not believe, their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it? -- romans 3:3
.
May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, as it is written, "THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS, AND PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED." -- romans 3:4
.
But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.) -- romans 3:5
.
May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world? -- romans 3:6
.
But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner? -- romans 3:7
.
And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say), "Let us do evil that good may come"? Their condemnation is just. -- romans 3:8
.
What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin; -- romans 3:9
.
as it is written, "THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE; -- romans 3:10
.
THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD; -- romans 3:11
.
ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE." -- romans 3:12
.
"THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE, WITH THEIR TONGUES THEY KEEP DECEIVING," "THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS"; -- romans 3:13
.
"WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS"; -- romans 3:14
.
"THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD, -- romans 3:15
.
DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS, -- romans 3:16
.
AND THE PATH OF PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN." -- romans 3:17
.
"THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES." -- romans 3:18
.
Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God; -- romans 3:19
.
because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin. -- romans 3:20
.
But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, -- romans 3:21
.
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction; -- romans 3:22
.
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, -- romans 3:23
.
being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; -- romans 3:24
.
whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; -- romans 3:25
.
for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. -- romans 3:26
.
Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. -- romans 3:27
.
For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law. -- romans 3:28
.
Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, -- romans 3:29
.
since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one. -- romans 3:30
.
Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law. -- romans 3:31
.
What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? -- romans 4:1
.
For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. -- romans 4:2
.
For what does the Scripture say? "ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS." -- romans 4:3
.
Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. -- romans 4:4
.
But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, -- romans 4:5
.
just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: -- romans 4:6
.
"BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED. -- romans 4:7
.
"BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT." -- romans 4:8
.
Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say, "FAITH WAS CREDITED TO ABRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS." -- romans 4:9
.
How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised; -- romans 4:10
.
and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, -- romans 4:11
.
and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised. -- romans 4:12
.
For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith. -- romans 4:13
.
For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified; -- romans 4:14
.
for the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation. -- romans 4:15
.
For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, -- romans 4:16
.
(as it is written, "A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU") in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist. -- romans 4:17
.
In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, "SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE." -- romans 4:18
.
Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb; -- romans 4:19
.
yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, -- romans 4:20
.
and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform. -- romans 4:21
.
Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. -- romans 4:22
.
Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, -- romans 4:23
.
but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, -- romans 4:24
.
He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification. -- romans 4:25
.
Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, -- romans 5:1
.
through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God. -- romans 5:2
.
And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; -- romans 5:3
.
and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope; -- romans 5:4
.
and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. -- romans 5:5
.
For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. -- romans 5:6
.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die. -- romans 5:7
.
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. -- romans 5:8
.
Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. -- romans 5:9
.
For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. -- romans 5:10
.
And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. -- romans 5:11
.
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned-- -- romans 5:12
.
for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. -- romans 5:13
.
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. -- romans 5:14
.
But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. -- romans 5:15
.
The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification. -- romans 5:16
.
For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. -- romans 5:17
.
So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. -- romans 5:18
.
For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous. -- romans 5:19
.
The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, -- romans 5:20
.
so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- romans 5:21
.
What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase? -- romans 6:1
.
May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? -- romans 6:2
.
Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? -- romans 6:3
.
Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. -- romans 6:4
.
For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, -- romans 6:5
.
knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; -- romans 6:6
.
for he who has died is freed from sin. -- romans 6:7
.
Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, -- romans 6:8
.
knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him. -- romans 6:9
.
For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. -- romans 6:10
.
Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. -- romans 6:11
.
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts, -- romans 6:12
.
and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. -- romans 6:13
.
For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace. -- romans 6:14
.
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be! -- romans 6:15
.
Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness? -- romans 6:16
.
But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed, -- romans 6:17
.
and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. -- romans 6:18
.
I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification. -- romans 6:19
.
For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. -- romans 6:20
.
Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death. -- romans 6:21
.
But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life. -- romans 6:22
.
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- romans 6:23
.
Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives? -- romans 7:1
.
For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband. -- romans 7:2
.
So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man. -- romans 7:3
.
Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. -- romans 7:4
.
For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death. -- romans 7:5
.
But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter. -- romans 7:6
.
What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, "YOU SHALL NOT COVET." -- romans 7:7
.
But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin is dead. -- romans 7:8
.
I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive and I died; -- romans 7:9
.
and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me; -- romans 7:10
.
for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. -- romans 7:11
.
So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. -- romans 7:12
.
Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful. -- romans 7:13
.
For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin. -- romans 7:14
.
For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate. -- romans 7:15
.
But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good. -- romans 7:16
.
So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me. -- romans 7:17
.
For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. -- romans 7:18
.
For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. -- romans 7:19
.
But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me. -- romans 7:20
.
I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. -- romans 7:21
.
For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, -- romans 7:22
.
but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members. -- romans 7:23
.
Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death? -- romans 7:24
.
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin. -- romans 7:25
.
Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. -- romans 8:1
.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. -- romans 8:2
.
For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, -- romans 8:3
.
so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. -- romans 8:4
.
For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. -- romans 8:5
.
For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, -- romans 8:6
.
because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so, -- romans 8:7
.
and those who are in the flesh cannot please God. -- romans 8:8
.
However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. -- romans 8:9
.
If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness. -- romans 8:10
.
But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you. -- romans 8:11
.
So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh-- -- romans 8:12
.
for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live. -- romans 8:13
.
For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. -- romans 8:14
.
For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, "Abba! Father!" -- romans 8:15
.
The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, -- romans 8:16
.
and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him. -- romans 8:17
.
For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. -- romans 8:18
.
For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. -- romans 8:19
.
For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope -- romans 8:20
.
that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. -- romans 8:21
.
For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. -- romans 8:22
.
And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body. -- romans 8:23
.
For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees? -- romans 8:24
.
But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it. -- romans 8:25
.
In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words; -- romans 8:26
.
and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. -- romans 8:27
.
And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. -- romans 8:28
.
For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; -- romans 8:29
.
and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified. -- romans 8:30
.
What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? -- romans 8:31
.
He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things? -- romans 8:32
.
Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies; -- romans 8:33
.
who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. -- romans 8:34
.
Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? -- romans 8:35
.
Just as it is written, "FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED." -- romans 8:36
.
But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. -- romans 8:37
.
For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, -- romans 8:38
.
nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- romans 8:39
.
I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, -- romans 9:1
.
that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. -- romans 9:2
.
For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, -- romans 9:3
.
who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises, -- romans 9:4
.
whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen. -- romans 9:5
.
But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; -- romans 9:6
.
nor are they all children because they are Abraham's descendants, but: "THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED." -- romans 9:7
.
That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants. -- romans 9:8
.
For this is the word of promise: "AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON." -- romans 9:9
.
And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac; -- romans 9:10
.
for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, -- romans 9:11
.
it was said to her, "THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER." -- romans 9:12
.
Just as it is written, "JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED." -- romans 9:13
.
What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be! -- romans 9:14
.
For He says to Moses, "I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION." -- romans 9:15
.
So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy. -- romans 9:16
.
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH." -- romans 9:17
.
So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires. -- romans 9:18
.
You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?" -- romans 9:19
.
On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, "Why did you make me like this," will it? -- romans 9:20
.
Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? -- romans 9:21
.
What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? -- romans 9:22
.
And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, -- romans 9:23
.
even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles. -- romans 9:24
.
As He says also in Hosea, "I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, 'MY PEOPLE,' AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, 'BELOVED.'" -- romans 9:25
.
"AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, 'YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,' THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD." -- romans 9:26
.
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED; -- romans 9:27
.
FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY." -- romans 9:28
.
And just as Isaiah foretold, "UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH." -- romans 9:29
.
What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith; -- romans 9:30
.
but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law. -- romans 9:31
.
Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, -- romans 9:32
.
just as it is written, "BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED." -- romans 9:33
.
Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation. -- romans 10:1
.
For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. -- romans 10:2
.
For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. -- romans 10:3
.
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. -- romans 10:4
.
For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness. -- romans 10:5
.
But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: "DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, 'WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?' (that is, to bring Christ down), -- romans 10:6
.
or 'WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)." -- romans 10:7
.
But what does it say? "THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"--that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, -- romans 10:8
.
that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; -- romans 10:9
.
for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. -- romans 10:10
.
For the Scripture says, "WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED." -- romans 10:11
.
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; -- romans 10:12
.
for "WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED." -- romans 10:13
.
How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? -- romans 10:14
.
How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, "HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!" -- romans 10:15
.
However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, "LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?" -- romans 10:16
.
So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. -- romans 10:17
.
But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; "THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD." -- romans 10:18
.
But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, "I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU." -- romans 10:19
.
And Isaiah is very bold and says, "I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME." -- romans 10:20
.
But as for Israel He says, "ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE." -- romans 10:21
.
I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. -- romans 11:1
.
God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? -- romans 11:2
.
"Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE." -- romans 11:3
.
But what is the divine response to him? "I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL." -- romans 11:4
.
In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God's gracious choice. -- romans 11:5
.
But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace. -- romans 11:6
.
What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened; -- romans 11:7
.
just as it is written, "GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY." -- romans 11:8
.
And David says, "LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM. -- romans 11:9
.
"LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER." -- romans 11:10
.
I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous. -- romans 11:11
.
Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be! -- romans 11:12
.
But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, -- romans 11:13
.
if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them. -- romans 11:14
.
For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? -- romans 11:15
.
If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too. -- romans 11:16
.
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, -- romans 11:17
.
do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you. -- romans 11:18
.
You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." -- romans 11:19
.
Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; -- romans 11:20
.
for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either. -- romans 11:21
.
Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God's kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. -- romans 11:22
.
And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. -- romans 11:23
.
For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? -- romans 11:24
.
For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery--so that you will not be wise in your own estimation--that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; -- romans 11:25
.
and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, "THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB." -- romans 11:26
.
"THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS." -- romans 11:27
.
From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God's choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers; -- romans 11:28
.
for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. -- romans 11:29
.
For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, -- romans 11:30
.
so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. -- romans 11:31
.
For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all. -- romans 11:32
.
Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! -- romans 11:33
.
For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR? -- romans 11:34
.
Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN? -- romans 11:35
.
For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen. -- romans 11:36
.
Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. -- romans 12:1
.
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. -- romans 12:2
.
For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. -- romans 12:3
.
For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, -- romans 12:4
.
so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. -- romans 12:5
.
Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; -- romans 12:6
.
if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching; -- romans 12:7
.
or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. -- romans 12:8
.
Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good. -- romans 12:9
.
Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor; -- romans 12:10
.
not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; -- romans 12:11
.
rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer, -- romans 12:12
.
contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality. -- romans 12:13
.
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. -- romans 12:14
.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. -- romans 12:15
.
Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation. -- romans 12:16
.
Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men. -- romans 12:17
.
If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men. -- romans 12:18
.
Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY," says the Lord. -- romans 12:19
.
"BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM, AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD." -- romans 12:20
.
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. -- romans 12:21
.
Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. -- romans 13:1
.
Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. -- romans 13:2
.
For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; -- romans 13:3
.
for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. -- romans 13:4
.
Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake. -- romans 13:5
.
For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. -- romans 13:6
.
Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor. -- romans 13:7
.
Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. -- romans 13:8
.
For this, "YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, YOU SHALL NOT MURDER, YOU SHALL NOT STEAL, YOU SHALL NOT COVET," and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF." -- romans 13:9
.
Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. -- romans 13:10
.
Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed. -- romans 13:11
.
The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. -- romans 13:12
.
Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy. -- romans 13:13
.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts. -- romans 13:14
.
Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions. -- romans 14:1
.
One person has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only. -- romans 14:2
.
The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him. -- romans 14:3
.
Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. -- romans 14:4
.
One person regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. -- romans 14:5
.
He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God. -- romans 14:6
.
For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself; -- romans 14:7
.
for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. -- romans 14:8
.
For to this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living. -- romans 14:9
.
But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. -- romans 14:10
.
For it is written, "AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME, AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL GIVE PRAISE TO GOD." -- romans 14:11
.
So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God. -- romans 14:12
.
Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this--not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way. -- romans 14:13
.
I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. -- romans 14:14
.
For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died. -- romans 14:15
.
Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil; -- romans 14:16
.
for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. -- romans 14:17
.
For he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. -- romans 14:18
.
So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another. -- romans 14:19
.
Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense. -- romans 14:20
.
It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles. -- romans 14:21
.
The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves. -- romans 14:22
.
But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin. -- romans 14:23
.
Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves. -- romans 15:1
.
Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification. -- romans 15:2
.
For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, "THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED YOU FELL ON ME." -- romans 15:3
.
For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. -- romans 15:4
.
Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, -- romans 15:5
.
so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- romans 15:6
.
Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God. -- romans 15:7
.
For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers, -- romans 15:8
.
and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, "THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO YOU AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I WILL SING TO YOUR NAME." -- romans 15:9
.
Again he says, "REJOICE, O GENTILES, WITH HIS PEOPLE." -- romans 15:10
.
And again, "PRAISE THE LORD ALL YOU GENTILES, AND LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE HIM." -- romans 15:11
.
Again Isaiah says, "THERE SHALL COME THE ROOT OF JESSE, AND HE WHO ARISES TO RULE OVER THE GENTILES, IN HIM SHALL THE GENTILES HOPE." -- romans 15:12
.
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. -- romans 15:13
.
And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another. -- romans 15:14
.
But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God, -- romans 15:15
.
to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. -- romans 15:16
.
Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God. -- romans 15:17
.
For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed, -- romans 15:18
.
in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. -- romans 15:19
.
And thus I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, so that I would not build on another man's foundation; -- romans 15:20
.
but as it is written, "THEY WHO HAD NO NEWS OF HIM SHALL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD SHALL UNDERSTAND." -- romans 15:21
.
For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you; -- romans 15:22
.
but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you -- romans 15:23
.
whenever I go to Spain--for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while-- -- romans 15:24
.
but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints. -- romans 15:25
.
For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. -- romans 15:26
.
Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material things. -- romans 15:27
.
Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain. -- romans 15:28
.
I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ. -- romans 15:29
.
Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, -- romans 15:30
.
that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints; -- romans 15:31
.
so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company. -- romans 15:32
.
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. -- romans 15:33
.
I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea; -- romans 16:1
.
that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well. -- romans 16:2
.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, -- romans 16:3
.
who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles; -- romans 16:4
.
also greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia. -- romans 16:5
.
Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you. -- romans 16:6
.
Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. -- romans 16:7
.
Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. -- romans 16:8
.
Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. -- romans 16:9
.
Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus. -- romans 16:10
.
Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. -- romans 16:11
.
Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord. -- romans 16:12
.
Greet Rufus, a choice man in the Lord, also his mother and mine. -- romans 16:13
.
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brethren with them. -- romans 16:14
.
Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. -- romans 16:15
.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you. -- romans 16:16
.
Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them. -- romans 16:17
.
For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting. -- romans 16:18
.
For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil. -- romans 16:19
.
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. -- romans 16:20
.
Timothy my fellow worker greets you, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen. -- romans 16:21
.
I, Tertius, who write this letter, greet you in the Lord. -- romans 16:22
.
Gaius, host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer greets you, and Quartus, the brother. -- romans 16:23
.
[The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.] -- romans 16:24
.
Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, -- romans 16:25
.
but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith; -- romans 16:26
.
to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen. -- romans 16:27
.
Paul, called as an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, -- 1 corinthians 1:1
.
To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours: -- 1 corinthians 1:2
.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 1:3
.
I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, -- 1 corinthians 1:4
.
that in everything you were enriched in Him, in all speech and all knowledge, -- 1 corinthians 1:5
.
even as the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed in you, -- 1 corinthians 1:6
.
so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- 1 corinthians 1:7
.
who will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 1:8
.
God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. -- 1 corinthians 1:9
.
Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. -- 1 corinthians 1:10
.
For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you. -- 1 corinthians 1:11
.
Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, "I am of Paul," and "I of Apollos," and "I of Cephas," and "I of Christ." -- 1 corinthians 1:12
.
Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? -- 1 corinthians 1:13
.
I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, -- 1 corinthians 1:14
.
so that no one would say you were baptized in my name. -- 1 corinthians 1:15
.
Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other. -- 1 corinthians 1:16
.
For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void. -- 1 corinthians 1:17
.
For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. -- 1 corinthians 1:18
.
For it is written, "I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE, AND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE." -- 1 corinthians 1:19
.
Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? -- 1 corinthians 1:20
.
For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe. -- 1 corinthians 1:21
.
For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; -- 1 corinthians 1:22
.
but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, -- 1 corinthians 1:23
.
but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. -- 1 corinthians 1:24
.
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. -- 1 corinthians 1:25
.
For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; -- 1 corinthians 1:26
.
but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, -- 1 corinthians 1:27
.
and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are, -- 1 corinthians 1:28
.
so that no man may boast before God. -- 1 corinthians 1:29
.
But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, -- 1 corinthians 1:30
.
so that, just as it is written, "LET HIM WHO BOASTS, BOAST IN THE LORD." -- 1 corinthians 1:31
.
And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:1
.
For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. -- 1 corinthians 2:2
.
I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, -- 1 corinthians 2:3
.
and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, -- 1 corinthians 2:4
.
so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:5
.
Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; -- 1 corinthians 2:6
.
but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory; -- 1 corinthians 2:7
.
the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; -- 1 corinthians 2:8
.
but just as it is written, "THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM." -- 1 corinthians 2:9
.
For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:10
.
For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. -- 1 corinthians 2:11
.
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, -- 1 corinthians 2:12
.
which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words. -- 1 corinthians 2:13
.
But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. -- 1 corinthians 2:14
.
But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. -- 1 corinthians 2:15
.
For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 2:16
.
And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. -- 1 corinthians 3:1
.
I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, -- 1 corinthians 3:2
.
for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men? -- 1 corinthians 3:3
.
For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not mere men? -- 1 corinthians 3:4
.
What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one. -- 1 corinthians 3:5
.
I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. -- 1 corinthians 3:6
.
So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth. -- 1 corinthians 3:7
.
Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. -- 1 corinthians 3:8
.
For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building. -- 1 corinthians 3:9
.
According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it. -- 1 corinthians 3:10
.
For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 3:11
.
Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, -- 1 corinthians 3:12
.
each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work. -- 1 corinthians 3:13
.
If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. -- 1 corinthians 3:14
.
If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. -- 1 corinthians 3:15
.
Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? -- 1 corinthians 3:16
.
If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are. -- 1 corinthians 3:17
.
Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. -- 1 corinthians 3:18
.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, "He is THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS"; -- 1 corinthians 3:19
.
and again, "THE LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS." -- 1 corinthians 3:20
.
So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you, -- 1 corinthians 3:21
.
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you, -- 1 corinthians 3:22
.
and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God. -- 1 corinthians 3:23
.
Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. -- 1 corinthians 4:1
.
In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy. -- 1 corinthians 4:2
.
But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you, or by any human court; in fact, I do not even examine myself. -- 1 corinthians 4:3
.
For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted; but the one who examines me is the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 4:4
.
Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's hearts; and then each man's praise will come to him from God. -- 1 corinthians 4:5
.
Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other. -- 1 corinthians 4:6
.
For who regards you as superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it? -- 1 corinthians 4:7
.
You are already filled, you have already become rich, you have become kings without us; and indeed, I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you. -- 1 corinthians 4:8
.
For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men. -- 1 corinthians 4:9
.
We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor. -- 1 corinthians 4:10
.
To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, and are roughly treated, and are homeless; -- 1 corinthians 4:11
.
and we toil, working with our own hands; when we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure; -- 1 corinthians 4:12
.
when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become as the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, even until now. -- 1 corinthians 4:13
.
I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children. -- 1 corinthians 4:14
.
For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. -- 1 corinthians 4:15
.
Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me. -- 1 corinthians 4:16
.
For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church. -- 1 corinthians 4:17
.
Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. -- 1 corinthians 4:18
.
But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power. -- 1 corinthians 4:19
.
For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power. -- 1 corinthians 4:20
.
What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness? -- 1 corinthians 4:21
.
It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father's wife. -- 1 corinthians 5:1
.
You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst. -- 1 corinthians 5:2
.
For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present. -- 1 corinthians 5:3
.
In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, -- 1 corinthians 5:4
.
I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. -- 1 corinthians 5:5
.
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough? -- 1 corinthians 5:6
.
Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed. -- 1 corinthians 5:7
.
Therefore let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. -- 1 corinthians 5:8
.
I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people; -- 1 corinthians 5:9
.
I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world. -- 1 corinthians 5:10
.
But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler--not even to eat with such a one. -- 1 corinthians 5:11
.
For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within the church? -- 1 corinthians 5:12
.
But those who are outside, God judges. REMOVE THE WICKED MAN FROM AMONG YOURSELVES. -- 1 corinthians 5:13
.
Does any one of you, when he has a case against his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints? -- 1 corinthians 6:1
.
Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts? -- 1 corinthians 6:2
.
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life? -- 1 corinthians 6:3
.
So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church? -- 1 corinthians 6:4
.
I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not among you one wise man who will be able to decide between his brethren, -- 1 corinthians 6:5
.
but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers? -- 1 corinthians 6:6
.
Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? -- 1 corinthians 6:7
.
On the contrary, you yourselves wrong and defraud. You do this even to your brethren. -- 1 corinthians 6:8
.
Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, -- 1 corinthians 6:9
.
nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. -- 1 corinthians 6:10
.
Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. -- 1 corinthians 6:11
.
All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything. -- 1 corinthians 6:12
.
Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. -- 1 corinthians 6:13
.
Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power. -- 1 corinthians 6:14
.
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be! -- 1 corinthians 6:15
.
Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, "THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH." -- 1 corinthians 6:16
.
But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him. -- 1 corinthians 6:17
.
Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body. -- 1 corinthians 6:18
.
Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? -- 1 corinthians 6:19
.
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body. -- 1 corinthians 6:20
.
Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman. -- 1 corinthians 7:1
.
But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:2
.
The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:3
.
The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. -- 1 corinthians 7:4
.
Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. -- 1 corinthians 7:5
.
But this I say by way of concession, not of command. -- 1 corinthians 7:6
.
Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that. -- 1 corinthians 7:7
.
But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I. -- 1 corinthians 7:8
.
But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. -- 1 corinthians 7:9
.
But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband -- 1 corinthians 7:10
.
(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:11
.
But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her. -- 1 corinthians 7:12
.
And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not send her husband away. -- 1 corinthians 7:13
.
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. -- 1 corinthians 7:14
.
Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace. -- 1 corinthians 7:15
.
For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife? -- 1 corinthians 7:16
.
Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches. -- 1 corinthians 7:17
.
Was any man called when he was already circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised. -- 1 corinthians 7:18
.
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but what matters is the keeping of the commandments of God. -- 1 corinthians 7:19
.
Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called. -- 1 corinthians 7:20
.
Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also to become free, rather do that. -- 1 corinthians 7:21
.
For he who was called in the Lord while a slave, is the Lord's freedman; likewise he who was called while free, is Christ's slave. -- 1 corinthians 7:22
.
You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men. -- 1 corinthians 7:23
.
Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called. -- 1 corinthians 7:24
.
Now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy. -- 1 corinthians 7:25
.
I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is. -- 1 corinthians 7:26
.
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. -- 1 corinthians 7:27
.
But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you. -- 1 corinthians 7:28
.
But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none; -- 1 corinthians 7:29
.
and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess; -- 1 corinthians 7:30
.
and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the form of this world is passing away. -- 1 corinthians 7:31
.
But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; -- 1 corinthians 7:32
.
but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, -- 1 corinthians 7:33
.
and his interests are divided. The woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband. -- 1 corinthians 7:34
.
This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 7:35
.
But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let her marry. -- 1 corinthians 7:36
.
But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has authority over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well. -- 1 corinthians 7:37
.
So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better. -- 1 corinthians 7:38
.
A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 7:39
.
But in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God. -- 1 corinthians 7:40
.
Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies. -- 1 corinthians 8:1
.
If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know; -- 1 corinthians 8:2
.
but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him. -- 1 corinthians 8:3
.
Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is no God but one. -- 1 corinthians 8:4
.
For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords, -- 1 corinthians 8:5
.
yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through Him. -- 1 corinthians 8:6
.
However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. -- 1 corinthians 8:7
.
But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat. -- 1 corinthians 8:8
.
But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. -- 1 corinthians 8:9
.
For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols? -- 1 corinthians 8:10
.
For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died. -- 1 corinthians 8:11
.
And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. -- 1 corinthians 8:12
.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble. -- 1 corinthians 8:13
.
Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? -- 1 corinthians 9:1
.
If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 9:2
.
My defense to those who examine me is this: -- 1 corinthians 9:3
.
Do we not have a right to eat and drink? -- 1 corinthians 9:4
.
Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? -- 1 corinthians 9:5
.
Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working? -- 1 corinthians 9:6
.
Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock? -- 1 corinthians 9:7
.
I am not speaking these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does not the Law also say these things? -- 1 corinthians 9:8
.
For it is written in the Law of Moses, "YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING." God is not concerned about oxen, is He? -- 1 corinthians 9:9
.
Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops. -- 1 corinthians 9:10
.
If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? -- 1 corinthians 9:11
.
If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 9:12
.
Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple, and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share from the altar? -- 1 corinthians 9:13
.
So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel. -- 1 corinthians 9:14
.
But I have used none of these things. And I am not writing these things so that it will be done so in my case; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make my boast an empty one. -- 1 corinthians 9:15
.
For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel. -- 1 corinthians 9:16
.
For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me. -- 1 corinthians 9:17
.
What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel. -- 1 corinthians 9:18
.
For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I may win more. -- 1 corinthians 9:19
.
To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being myself under the Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law; -- 1 corinthians 9:20
.
to those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law. -- 1 corinthians 9:21
.
To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some. -- 1 corinthians 9:22
.
I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it. -- 1 corinthians 9:23
.
Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. -- 1 corinthians 9:24
.
Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. -- 1 corinthians 9:25
.
Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; -- 1 corinthians 9:26
.
but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified. -- 1 corinthians 9:27
.
For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; -- 1 corinthians 10:1
.
and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; -- 1 corinthians 10:2
.
and all ate the same spiritual food; -- 1 corinthians 10:3
.
and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ. -- 1 corinthians 10:4
.
Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid low in the wilderness. -- 1 corinthians 10:5
.
Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved. -- 1 corinthians 10:6
.
Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, "THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND STOOD UP TO PLAY." -- 1 corinthians 10:7
.
Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day. -- 1 corinthians 10:8
.
Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents. -- 1 corinthians 10:9
.
Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer. -- 1 corinthians 10:10
.
Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. -- 1 corinthians 10:11
.
Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall. -- 1 corinthians 10:12
.
No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it. -- 1 corinthians 10:13
.
Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. -- 1 corinthians 10:14
.
I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say. -- 1 corinthians 10:15
.
Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ? -- 1 corinthians 10:16
.
Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread. -- 1 corinthians 10:17
.
Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar? -- 1 corinthians 10:18
.
What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? -- 1 corinthians 10:19
.
No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons. -- 1 corinthians 10:20
.
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. -- 1 corinthians 10:21
.
Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we? -- 1 corinthians 10:22
.
All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify. -- 1 corinthians 10:23
.
Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor. -- 1 corinthians 10:24
.
Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience' sake; -- 1 corinthians 10:25
.
FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S, AND ALL IT CONTAINS. -- 1 corinthians 10:26
.
If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience' sake. -- 1 corinthians 10:27
.
But if anyone says to you, "This is meat sacrificed to idols," do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience' sake; -- 1 corinthians 10:28
.
I mean not your own conscience, but the other man's; for why is my freedom judged by another's conscience? -- 1 corinthians 10:29
.
If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks? -- 1 corinthians 10:30
.
Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. -- 1 corinthians 10:31
.
Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God; -- 1 corinthians 10:32
.
just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many, so that they may be saved. -- 1 corinthians 10:33
.
Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 11:1
.
Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you. -- 1 corinthians 11:2
.
But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ. -- 1 corinthians 11:3
.
Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head. -- 1 corinthians 11:4
.
But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved. -- 1 corinthians 11:5
.
For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head. -- 1 corinthians 11:6
.
For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. -- 1 corinthians 11:7
.
For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man; -- 1 corinthians 11:8
.
for indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake. -- 1 corinthians 11:9
.
Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. -- 1 corinthians 11:10
.
However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. -- 1 corinthians 11:11
.
For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God. -- 1 corinthians 11:12
.
Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? -- 1 corinthians 11:13
.
Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him, -- 1 corinthians 11:14
.
but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering. -- 1 corinthians 11:15
.
But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God. -- 1 corinthians 11:16
.
But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. -- 1 corinthians 11:17
.
For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it. -- 1 corinthians 11:18
.
For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you. -- 1 corinthians 11:19
.
Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper, -- 1 corinthians 11:20
.
for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk. -- 1 corinthians 11:21
.
What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you. -- 1 corinthians 11:22
.
For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; -- 1 corinthians 11:23
.
and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me." -- 1 corinthians 11:24
.
In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me." -- 1 corinthians 11:25
.
For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes. -- 1 corinthians 11:26
.
Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 11:27
.
But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. -- 1 corinthians 11:28
.
For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly. -- 1 corinthians 11:29
.
For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep. -- 1 corinthians 11:30
.
But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged. -- 1 corinthians 11:31
.
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world. -- 1 corinthians 11:32
.
So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. -- 1 corinthians 11:33
.
If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come. -- 1 corinthians 11:34
.
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware. -- 1 corinthians 12:1
.
You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the mute idols, however you were led. -- 1 corinthians 12:2
.
Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is accursed"; and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit. -- 1 corinthians 12:3
.
Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit. -- 1 corinthians 12:4
.
And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord. -- 1 corinthians 12:5
.
There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons. -- 1 corinthians 12:6
.
But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. -- 1 corinthians 12:7
.
For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; -- 1 corinthians 12:8
.
to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, -- 1 corinthians 12:9
.
and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. -- 1 corinthians 12:10
.
But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills. -- 1 corinthians 12:11
.
For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ. -- 1 corinthians 12:12
.
For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. -- 1 corinthians 12:13
.
For the body is not one member, but many. -- 1 corinthians 12:14
.
If the foot says, "Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body," it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. -- 1 corinthians 12:15
.
And if the ear says, "Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body," it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. -- 1 corinthians 12:16
.
If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? -- 1 corinthians 12:17
.
But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. -- 1 corinthians 12:18
.
If they were all one member, where would the body be? -- 1 corinthians 12:19
.
But now there are many members, but one body. -- 1 corinthians 12:20
.
And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; or again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." -- 1 corinthians 12:21
.
On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; -- 1 corinthians 12:22
.
and those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable, -- 1 corinthians 12:23
.
whereas our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, -- 1 corinthians 12:24
.
so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. -- 1 corinthians 12:25
.
And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. -- 1 corinthians 12:26
.
Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it. -- 1 corinthians 12:27
.
And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues. -- 1 corinthians 12:28
.
All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they? -- 1 corinthians 12:29
.
All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they? -- 1 corinthians 12:30
.
But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way. -- 1 corinthians 12:31
.
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. -- 1 corinthians 13:1
.
If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. -- 1 corinthians 13:2
.
And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. -- 1 corinthians 13:3
.
Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, -- 1 corinthians 13:4
.
does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, -- 1 corinthians 13:5
.
does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; -- 1 corinthians 13:6
.
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. -- 1 corinthians 13:7
.
Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away. -- 1 corinthians 13:8
.
For we know in part and we prophesy in part; -- 1 corinthians 13:9
.
but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. -- 1 corinthians 13:10
.
When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things. -- 1 corinthians 13:11
.
For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. -- 1 corinthians 13:12
.
But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love. -- 1 corinthians 13:13
.
Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. -- 1 corinthians 14:1
.
For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries. -- 1 corinthians 14:2
.
But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation. -- 1 corinthians 14:3
.
One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church. -- 1 corinthians 14:4
.
Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edifying. -- 1 corinthians 14:5
.
But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching? -- 1 corinthians 14:6
.
Yet even lifeless things, either flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp? -- 1 corinthians 14:7
.
For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle? -- 1 corinthians 14:8
.
So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. -- 1 corinthians 14:9
.
There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and no kind is without meaning. -- 1 corinthians 14:10
.
If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me. -- 1 corinthians 14:11
.
So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound for the edification of the church. -- 1 corinthians 14:12
.
Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. -- 1 corinthians 14:13
.
For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. -- 1 corinthians 14:14
.
What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also. -- 1 corinthians 14:15
.
Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying? -- 1 corinthians 14:16
.
For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not edified. -- 1 corinthians 14:17
.
I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all; -- 1 corinthians 14:18
.
however, in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue. -- 1 corinthians 14:19
.
Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature. -- 1 corinthians 14:20
.
In the Law it is written, "BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME," says the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 14:21
.
So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers but to those who believe. -- 1 corinthians 14:22
.
Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad? -- 1 corinthians 14:23
.
But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all; -- 1 corinthians 14:24
.
the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you. -- 1 corinthians 14:25
.
What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. -- 1 corinthians 14:26
.
If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret; -- 1 corinthians 14:27
.
but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God. -- 1 corinthians 14:28
.
Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment. -- 1 corinthians 14:29
.
But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, the first one must keep silent. -- 1 corinthians 14:30
.
For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted; -- 1 corinthians 14:31
.
and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets; -- 1 corinthians 14:32
.
for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints. -- 1 corinthians 14:33
.
The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says. -- 1 corinthians 14:34
.
If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church. -- 1 corinthians 14:35
.
Was it from you that the word of God first went forth? Or has it come to you only? -- 1 corinthians 14:36
.
If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment. -- 1 corinthians 14:37
.
But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. -- 1 corinthians 14:38
.
Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues. -- 1 corinthians 14:39
.
But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner. -- 1 corinthians 14:40
.
Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, -- 1 corinthians 15:1
.
by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. -- 1 corinthians 15:2
.
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, -- 1 corinthians 15:3
.
and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, -- 1 corinthians 15:4
.
and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. -- 1 corinthians 15:5
.
After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; -- 1 corinthians 15:6
.
then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles; -- 1 corinthians 15:7
.
and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also. -- 1 corinthians 15:8
.
For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. -- 1 corinthians 15:9
.
But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me. -- 1 corinthians 15:10
.
Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed. -- 1 corinthians 15:11
.
Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? -- 1 corinthians 15:12
.
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised; -- 1 corinthians 15:13
.
and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain. -- 1 corinthians 15:14
.
Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised. -- 1 corinthians 15:15
.
For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised; -- 1 corinthians 15:16
.
and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. -- 1 corinthians 15:17
.
Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. -- 1 corinthians 15:18
.
If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied. -- 1 corinthians 15:19
.
But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep. -- 1 corinthians 15:20
.
For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead. -- 1 corinthians 15:21
.
For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. -- 1 corinthians 15:22
.
But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ's at His coming, -- 1 corinthians 15:23
.
then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power. -- 1 corinthians 15:24
.
For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. -- 1 corinthians 15:25
.
The last enemy that will be abolished is death. -- 1 corinthians 15:26
.
For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET. But when He says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him. -- 1 corinthians 15:27
.
When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all. -- 1 corinthians 15:28
.
Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them? -- 1 corinthians 15:29
.
Why are we also in danger every hour? -- 1 corinthians 15:30
.
I affirm, brethren, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. -- 1 corinthians 15:31
.
If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, LET US EAT AND DRINK, FOR TOMORROW WE DIE. -- 1 corinthians 15:32
.
Do not be deceived: "Bad company corrupts good morals." -- 1 corinthians 15:33
.
Become sober-minded as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. -- 1 corinthians 15:34
.
But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?" -- 1 corinthians 15:35
.
You fool! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies; -- 1 corinthians 15:36
.
and that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else. -- 1 corinthians 15:37
.
But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own. -- 1 corinthians 15:38
.
All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish. -- 1 corinthians 15:39
.
There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another. -- 1 corinthians 15:40
.
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory. -- 1 corinthians 15:41
.
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body; -- 1 corinthians 15:42
.
it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; -- 1 corinthians 15:43
.
it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. -- 1 corinthians 15:44
.
So also it is written, "The first MAN, Adam, BECAME A LIVING SOUL." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. -- 1 corinthians 15:45
.
However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual. -- 1 corinthians 15:46
.
The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven. -- 1 corinthians 15:47
.
As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly. -- 1 corinthians 15:48
.
Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly. -- 1 corinthians 15:49
.
Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. -- 1 corinthians 15:50
.
Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, -- 1 corinthians 15:51
.
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. -- 1 corinthians 15:52
.
For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. -- 1 corinthians 15:53
.
But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, "DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory. -- 1 corinthians 15:54
.
"O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?" -- 1 corinthians 15:55
.
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; -- 1 corinthians 15:56
.
but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 corinthians 15:57
.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord. -- 1 corinthians 15:58
.
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also. -- 1 corinthians 16:1
.
On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come. -- 1 corinthians 16:2
.
When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem; -- 1 corinthians 16:3
.
and if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me. -- 1 corinthians 16:4
.
But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia; -- 1 corinthians 16:5
.
and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go. -- 1 corinthians 16:6
.
For I do not wish to see you now just in passing; for I hope to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits. -- 1 corinthians 16:7
.
But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost; -- 1 corinthians 16:8
.
for a wide door for effective service has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. -- 1 corinthians 16:9
.
Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to be afraid, for he is doing the Lord's work, as I also am. -- 1 corinthians 16:10
.
So let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren. -- 1 corinthians 16:11
.
But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity. -- 1 corinthians 16:12
.
Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. -- 1 corinthians 16:13
.
Let all that you do be done in love. -- 1 corinthians 16:14
.
Now I urge you, brethren (you know the household of Stephanas, that they were the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to the saints), -- 1 corinthians 16:15
.
that you also be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors. -- 1 corinthians 16:16
.
I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part. -- 1 corinthians 16:17
.
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men. -- 1 corinthians 16:18
.
The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. -- 1 corinthians 16:19
.
All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. -- 1 corinthians 16:20
.
The greeting is in my own hand--Paul. -- 1 corinthians 16:21
.
If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed. Maranatha. -- 1 corinthians 16:22
.
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. -- 1 corinthians 16:23
.
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. -- 1 corinthians 16:24
.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are throughout Achaia: -- 2 corinthians 1:1
.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 corinthians 1:2
.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, -- 2 corinthians 1:3
.
who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. -- 2 corinthians 1:4
.
For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ. -- 2 corinthians 1:5
.
But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer; -- 2 corinthians 1:6
.
and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are sharers of our comfort. -- 2 corinthians 1:7
.
For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life; -- 2 corinthians 1:8
.
indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; -- 2 corinthians 1:9
.
who delivered us from so great a peril of death, and will deliver us, He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us, -- 2 corinthians 1:10
.
you also joining in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through the prayers of many. -- 2 corinthians 1:11
.
For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you. -- 2 corinthians 1:12
.
For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand until the end; -- 2 corinthians 1:13
.
just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus. -- 2 corinthians 1:14
.
In this confidence I intended at first to come to you, so that you might twice receive a blessing; -- 2 corinthians 1:15
.
that is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey to Judea. -- 2 corinthians 1:16
.
Therefore, I was not vacillating when I intended to do this, was I? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there will be yes, yes and no, no at the same time? -- 2 corinthians 1:17
.
But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no. -- 2 corinthians 1:18
.
For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us--by me and Silvanus and Timothy--was not yes and no, but is yes in Him. -- 2 corinthians 1:19
.
For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us. -- 2 corinthians 1:20
.
Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God, -- 2 corinthians 1:21
.
who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge. -- 2 corinthians 1:22
.
But I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth. -- 2 corinthians 1:23
.
Not that we lord it over your faith, but are workers with you for your joy; for in your faith you are standing firm. -- 2 corinthians 1:24
.
But I determined this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again. -- 2 corinthians 2:1
.
For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful? -- 2 corinthians 2:2
.
This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all. -- 2 corinthians 2:3
.
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you. -- 2 corinthians 2:4
.
But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in some degree--in order not to say too much--to all of you. -- 2 corinthians 2:5
.
Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority, -- 2 corinthians 2:6
.
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. -- 2 corinthians 2:7
.
Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him. -- 2 corinthians 2:8
.
For to this end also I wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. -- 2 corinthians 2:9
.
But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ, -- 2 corinthians 2:10
.
so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes. -- 2 corinthians 2:11
.
Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord, -- 2 corinthians 2:12
.
I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia. -- 2 corinthians 2:13
.
But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place. -- 2 corinthians 2:14
.
For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing; -- 2 corinthians 2:15
.
to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things? -- 2 corinthians 2:16
.
For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God. -- 2 corinthians 2:17
.
Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you? -- 2 corinthians 3:1
.
You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men; -- 2 corinthians 3:2
.
being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. -- 2 corinthians 3:3
.
Such confidence we have through Christ toward God. -- 2 corinthians 3:4
.
Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, -- 2 corinthians 3:5
.
who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. -- 2 corinthians 3:6
.
But if the ministry of death, in letters engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading as it was, -- 2 corinthians 3:7
.
how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory? -- 2 corinthians 3:8
.
For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory. -- 2 corinthians 3:9
.
For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it. -- 2 corinthians 3:10
.
For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory. -- 2 corinthians 3:11
.
Therefore having such a hope, we use great boldness in our speech, -- 2 corinthians 3:12
.
and are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not look intently at the end of what was fading away. -- 2 corinthians 3:13
.
But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ. -- 2 corinthians 3:14
.
But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart; -- 2 corinthians 3:15
.
but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. -- 2 corinthians 3:16
.
Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. -- 2 corinthians 3:17
.
But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit. -- 2 corinthians 3:18
.
Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart, -- 2 corinthians 4:1
.
but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. -- 2 corinthians 4:2
.
And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, -- 2 corinthians 4:3
.
in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. -- 2 corinthians 4:4
.
For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus' sake. -- 2 corinthians 4:5
.
For God, who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. -- 2 corinthians 4:6
.
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves; -- 2 corinthians 4:7
.
we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing; -- 2 corinthians 4:8
.
persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; -- 2 corinthians 4:9
.
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. -- 2 corinthians 4:10
.
For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. -- 2 corinthians 4:11
.
So death works in us, but life in you. -- 2 corinthians 4:12
.
But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE," we also believe, therefore we also speak, -- 2 corinthians 4:13
.
knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you. -- 2 corinthians 4:14
.
For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God. -- 2 corinthians 4:15
.
Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. -- 2 corinthians 4:16
.
For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, -- 2 corinthians 4:17
.
while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. -- 2 corinthians 4:18
.
For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. -- 2 corinthians 5:1
.
For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven, -- 2 corinthians 5:2
.
inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked. -- 2 corinthians 5:3
.
For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life. -- 2 corinthians 5:4
.
Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge. -- 2 corinthians 5:5
.
Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord-- -- 2 corinthians 5:6
.
for we walk by faith, not by sight-- -- 2 corinthians 5:7
.
we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 5:8
.
Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him. -- 2 corinthians 5:9
.
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. -- 2 corinthians 5:10
.
Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences. -- 2 corinthians 5:11
.
We are not again commending ourselves to you but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart. -- 2 corinthians 5:12
.
For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. -- 2 corinthians 5:13
.
For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died; -- 2 corinthians 5:14
.
and He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf. -- 2 corinthians 5:15
.
Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer. -- 2 corinthians 5:16
.
Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come. -- 2 corinthians 5:17
.
Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, -- 2 corinthians 5:18
.
namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation. -- 2 corinthians 5:19
.
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. -- 2 corinthians 5:20
.
He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. -- 2 corinthians 5:21
.
And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain-- -- 2 corinthians 6:1
.
for He says, "AT THE ACCEPTABLE TIME I LISTENED TO YOU, AND ON THE DAY OF SALVATION I HELPED YOU." Behold, now is "THE ACCEPTABLE TIME," behold, now is "THE DAY OF SALVATION"-- -- 2 corinthians 6:2
.
giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited, -- 2 corinthians 6:3
.
but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, -- 2 corinthians 6:4
.
in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, -- 2 corinthians 6:5
.
in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love, -- 2 corinthians 6:6
.
in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, -- 2 corinthians 6:7
.
by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true; -- 2 corinthians 6:8
.
as unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not put to death, -- 2 corinthians 6:9
.
as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things. -- 2 corinthians 6:10
.
Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide. -- 2 corinthians 6:11
.
You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections. -- 2 corinthians 6:12
.
Now in a like exchange--I speak as to children--open wide to us also. -- 2 corinthians 6:13
.
Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? -- 2 corinthians 6:14
.
Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? -- 2 corinthians 6:15
.
Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, "I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE. -- 2 corinthians 6:16
.
"Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE," says the Lord. "AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I will welcome you. -- 2 corinthians 6:17
.
"And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me," Says the Lord Almighty. -- 2 corinthians 6:18
.
Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. -- 2 corinthians 7:1
.
Make room for us in your hearts; we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one. -- 2 corinthians 7:2
.
I do not speak to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together. -- 2 corinthians 7:3
.
Great is my confidence in you; great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction. -- 2 corinthians 7:4
.
For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears within. -- 2 corinthians 7:5
.
But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus; -- 2 corinthians 7:6
.
and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more. -- 2 corinthians 7:7
.
For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it--for I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while-- -- 2 corinthians 7:8
.
I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us. -- 2 corinthians 7:9
.
For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death. -- 2 corinthians 7:10
.
For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter. -- 2 corinthians 7:11
.
So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God. -- 2 corinthians 7:12
.
For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. -- 2 corinthians 7:13
.
For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth. -- 2 corinthians 7:14
.
His affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling. -- 2 corinthians 7:15
.
I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you. -- 2 corinthians 7:16
.
Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, -- 2 corinthians 8:1
.
that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality. -- 2 corinthians 8:2
.
For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord, -- 2 corinthians 8:3
.
begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints, -- 2 corinthians 8:4
.
and this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God. -- 2 corinthians 8:5
.
So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well. -- 2 corinthians 8:6
.
But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, see that you abound in this gracious work also. -- 2 corinthians 8:7
.
I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also. -- 2 corinthians 8:8
.
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich. -- 2 corinthians 8:9
.
I give my opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it. -- 2 corinthians 8:10
.
But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was the readiness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your ability. -- 2 corinthians 8:11
.
For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. -- 2 corinthians 8:12
.
For this is not for the ease of others and for your affliction, but by way of equality-- -- 2 corinthians 8:13
.
at this present time your abundance being a supply for their need, so that their abundance also may become a supply for your need, that there may be equality; -- 2 corinthians 8:14
.
as it is written, "HE WHO gathered MUCH DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH, AND HE WHO gathered LITTLE HAD NO LACK." -- 2 corinthians 8:15
.
But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus. -- 2 corinthians 8:16
.
For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord. -- 2 corinthians 8:17
.
We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in the things of the gospel has spread through all the churches; -- 2 corinthians 8:18
.
and not only this, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and to show our readiness, -- 2 corinthians 8:19
.
taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift; -- 2 corinthians 8:20
.
for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. -- 2 corinthians 8:21
.
We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you. -- 2 corinthians 8:22
.
As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ. -- 2 corinthians 8:23
.
Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you. -- 2 corinthians 8:24
.
For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints; -- 2 corinthians 9:1
.
for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, namely, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them. -- 2 corinthians 9:2
.
But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you may be prepared; -- 2 corinthians 9:3
.
otherwise if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to speak of you--will be put to shame by this confidence. -- 2 corinthians 9:4
.
So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness. -- 2 corinthians 9:5
.
Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. -- 2 corinthians 9:6
.
Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. -- 2 corinthians 9:7
.
And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed; -- 2 corinthians 9:8
.
as it is written, "HE SCATTERED ABROAD, HE GAVE TO THE POOR, HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER." -- 2 corinthians 9:9
.
Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness; -- 2 corinthians 9:10
.
you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God. -- 2 corinthians 9:11
.
For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God. -- 2 corinthians 9:12
.
Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all, -- 2 corinthians 9:13
.
while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you. -- 2 corinthians 9:14
.
Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! -- 2 corinthians 9:15
.
Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ--I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent! -- 2 corinthians 10:1
.
I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh. -- 2 corinthians 10:2
.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, -- 2 corinthians 10:3
.
for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. -- 2 corinthians 10:4
.
We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, -- 2 corinthians 10:5
.
and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete. -- 2 corinthians 10:6
.
You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we. -- 2 corinthians 10:7
.
For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be put to shame, -- 2 corinthians 10:8
.
for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters. -- 2 corinthians 10:9
.
For they say, "His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible." -- 2 corinthians 10:10
.
Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such persons we are also in deed when present. -- 2 corinthians 10:11
.
For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding. -- 2 corinthians 10:12
.
But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even as far as you. -- 2 corinthians 10:13
.
For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of Christ; -- 2 corinthians 10:14
.
not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men's labors, but with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged even more by you, -- 2 corinthians 10:15
.
so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, and not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another. -- 2 corinthians 10:16
.
But HE WHO BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE LORD. -- 2 corinthians 10:17
.
For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends. -- 2 corinthians 10:18
.
I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me. -- 2 corinthians 11:1
.
For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin. -- 2 corinthians 11:2
.
But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ. -- 2 corinthians 11:3
.
For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear this beautifully. -- 2 corinthians 11:4
.
For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles. -- 2 corinthians 11:5
.
But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not so in knowledge; in fact, in every way we have made this evident to you in all things. -- 2 corinthians 11:6
.
Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge? -- 2 corinthians 11:7
.
I robbed other churches by taking wages from them to serve you; -- 2 corinthians 11:8
.
and when I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for when the brethren came from Macedonia they fully supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will continue to do so. -- 2 corinthians 11:9
.
As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia. -- 2 corinthians 11:10
.
Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! -- 2 corinthians 11:11
.
But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting. -- 2 corinthians 11:12
.
For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. -- 2 corinthians 11:13
.
No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. -- 2 corinthians 11:14
.
Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds. -- 2 corinthians 11:15
.
Again I say, let no one think me foolish; but if you do, receive me even as foolish, so that I also may boast a little. -- 2 corinthians 11:16
.
What I am saying, I am not saying as the Lord would, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting. -- 2 corinthians 11:17
.
Since many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also. -- 2 corinthians 11:18
.
For you, being so wise, tolerate the foolish gladly. -- 2 corinthians 11:19
.
For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, anyone devours you, anyone takes advantage of you, anyone exalts himself, anyone hits you in the face. -- 2 corinthians 11:20
.
To my shame I must say that we have been weak by comparison. But in whatever respect anyone else is bold--I speak in foolishness--I am just as bold myself. -- 2 corinthians 11:21
.
Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. -- 2 corinthians 11:22
.
Are they servants of Christ?--I speak as if insane--I more so; in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death. -- 2 corinthians 11:23
.
Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine lashes. -- 2 corinthians 11:24
.
Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep. -- 2 corinthians 11:25
.
I have been on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren; -- 2 corinthians 11:26
.
I have been in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. -- 2 corinthians 11:27
.
Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. -- 2 corinthians 11:28
.
Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern? -- 2 corinthians 11:29
.
If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness. -- 2 corinthians 11:30
.
The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. -- 2 corinthians 11:31
.
In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me, -- 2 corinthians 11:32
.
and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands. -- 2 corinthians 11:33
.
Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. -- 2 corinthians 12:1
.
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago--whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows--such a man was caught up to the third heaven. -- 2 corinthians 12:2
.
And I know how such a man--whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows-- -- 2 corinthians 12:3
.
was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak. -- 2 corinthians 12:4
.
On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses. -- 2 corinthians 12:5
.
For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain from this, so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me. -- 2 corinthians 12:6
.
Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me--to keep me from exalting myself! -- 2 corinthians 12:7
.
Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me. -- 2 corinthians 12:8
.
And He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness." Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. -- 2 corinthians 12:9
.
Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong. -- 2 corinthians 12:10
.
I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am a nobody. -- 2 corinthians 12:11
.
The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles. -- 2 corinthians 12:12
.
For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! -- 2 corinthians 12:13
.
Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. -- 2 corinthians 12:14
.
I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? -- 2 corinthians 12:15
.
But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit. -- 2 corinthians 12:16
.
Certainly I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I? -- 2 corinthians 12:17
.
I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit and walk in the same steps? -- 2 corinthians 12:18
.
All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Actually, it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved. -- 2 corinthians 12:19
.
For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances; -- 2 corinthians 12:20
.
I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced. -- 2 corinthians 12:21
.
This is the third time I am coming to you. EVERY FACT IS TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES. -- 2 corinthians 13:1
.
I have previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest as well, that if I come again I will not spare anyone, -- 2 corinthians 13:2
.
since you are seeking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me, and who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you. -- 2 corinthians 13:3
.
For indeed He was crucified because of weakness, yet He lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, yet we will live with Him because of the power of God directed toward you. -- 2 corinthians 13:4
.
Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you--unless indeed you fail the test? -- 2 corinthians 13:5
.
But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test. -- 2 corinthians 13:6
.
Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear unapproved. -- 2 corinthians 13:7
.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth. -- 2 corinthians 13:8
.
For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you be made complete. -- 2 corinthians 13:9
.
For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down. -- 2 corinthians 13:10
.
Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. -- 2 corinthians 13:11
.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. -- 2 corinthians 13:12
.
All the saints greet you. -- 2 corinthians 13:13
.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. -- 2 corinthians 13:14
.
Paul, an apostle (not sent from men nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead), -- galatians 1:1
.
and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: -- galatians 1:2
.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, -- galatians 1:3
.
who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, -- galatians 1:4
.
to whom be the glory forevermore. Amen. -- galatians 1:5
.
I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; -- galatians 1:6
.
which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. -- galatians 1:7
.
But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! -- galatians 1:8
.
As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed! -- galatians 1:9
.
For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ. -- galatians 1:10
.
For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. -- galatians 1:11
.
For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. -- galatians 1:12
.
For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it; -- galatians 1:13
.
and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions. -- galatians 1:14
.
But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through His grace, was pleased -- galatians 1:15
.
to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood, -- galatians 1:16
.
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus. -- galatians 1:17
.
Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days. -- galatians 1:18
.
But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord's brother. -- galatians 1:19
.
(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.) -- galatians 1:20
.
Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. -- galatians 1:21
.
I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ; -- galatians 1:22
.
but only, they kept hearing, "He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy." -- galatians 1:23
.
And they were glorifying God because of me. -- galatians 1:24
.
Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. -- galatians 2:1
.
It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain. -- galatians 2:2
.
But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. -- galatians 2:3
.
But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage. -- galatians 2:4
.
But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. -- galatians 2:5
.
But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me. -- galatians 2:6
.
But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised -- galatians 2:7
.
(for He who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles), -- galatians 2:8
.
and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. -- galatians 2:9
.
They only asked us to remember the poor--the very thing I also was eager to do. -- galatians 2:10
.
But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. -- galatians 2:11
.
For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision. -- galatians 2:12
.
The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. -- galatians 2:13
.
But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, "If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews? -- galatians 2:14
.
"We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; -- galatians 2:15
.
nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified. -- galatians 2:16
.
"But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be! -- galatians 2:17
.
"For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor. -- galatians 2:18
.
"For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God. -- galatians 2:19
.
"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. -- galatians 2:20
.
"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly." -- galatians 2:21
.
You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? -- galatians 3:1
.
This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? -- galatians 3:2
.
Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? -- galatians 3:3
.
Did you suffer so many things in vain--if indeed it was in vain? -- galatians 3:4
.
So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? -- galatians 3:5
.
Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. -- galatians 3:6
.
Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. -- galatians 3:7
.
The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU." -- galatians 3:8
.
So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer. -- galatians 3:9
.
For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM." -- galatians 3:10
.
Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, "THE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL LIVE BY FAITH." -- galatians 3:11
.
However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, "HE WHO PRACTICES THEM SHALL LIVE BY THEM." -- galatians 3:12
.
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us--for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE"-- -- galatians 3:13
.
in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. -- galatians 3:14
.
Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it. -- galatians 3:15
.
Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as referring to many, but rather to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ. -- galatians 3:16
.
What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise. -- galatians 3:17
.
For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise. -- galatians 3:18
.
Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made. -- galatians 3:19
.
Now a mediator is not for one party only; whereas God is only one. -- galatians 3:20
.
Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. -- galatians 3:21
.
But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. -- galatians 3:22
.
But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. -- galatians 3:23
.
Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith. -- galatians 3:24
.
But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. -- galatians 3:25
.
For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. -- galatians 3:26
.
For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. -- galatians 3:27
.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. -- galatians 3:28
.
And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise. -- galatians 3:29
.
Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything, -- galatians 4:1
.
but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father. -- galatians 4:2
.
So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world. -- galatians 4:3
.
But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, -- galatians 4:4
.
so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. -- galatians 4:5
.
Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!" -- galatians 4:6
.
Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God. -- galatians 4:7
.
However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods. -- galatians 4:8
.
But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again? -- galatians 4:9
.
You observe days and months and seasons and years. -- galatians 4:10
.
I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain. -- galatians 4:11
.
I beg of you, brethren, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong; -- galatians 4:12
.
but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time; -- galatians 4:13
.
and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself. -- galatians 4:14
.
Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. -- galatians 4:15
.
So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? -- galatians 4:16
.
They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them. -- galatians 4:17
.
But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you. -- galatians 4:18
.
My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you-- -- galatians 4:19
.
but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you. -- galatians 4:20
.
Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law? -- galatians 4:21
.
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman. -- galatians 4:22
.
But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise. -- galatians 4:23
.
This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants: one proceeding from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar. -- galatians 4:24
.
Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. -- galatians 4:25
.
But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother. -- galatians 4:26
.
For it is written, "REJOICE, BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH AND SHOUT, YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR; FOR MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE THAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND." -- galatians 4:27
.
And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise. -- galatians 4:28
.
But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also. -- galatians 4:29
.
But what does the Scripture say? "CAST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON, FOR THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN." -- galatians 4:30
.
So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman. -- galatians 4:31
.
It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. -- galatians 5:1
.
Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you. -- galatians 5:2
.
And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law. -- galatians 5:3
.
You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. -- galatians 5:4
.
For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness. -- galatians 5:5
.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love. -- galatians 5:6
.
You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? -- galatians 5:7
.
This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you. -- galatians 5:8
.
A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough. -- galatians 5:9
.
I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is. -- galatians 5:10
.
But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished. -- galatians 5:11
.
I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves. -- galatians 5:12
.
For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. -- galatians 5:13
.
For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF." -- galatians 5:14
.
But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another. -- galatians 5:15
.
But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. -- galatians 5:16
.
For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. -- galatians 5:17
.
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law. -- galatians 5:18
.
Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, -- galatians 5:19
.
idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, -- galatians 5:20
.
envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. -- galatians 5:21
.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, -- galatians 5:22
.
gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. -- galatians 5:23
.
Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. -- galatians 5:24
.
If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. -- galatians 5:25
.
Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another. -- galatians 5:26
.
Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted. -- galatians 6:1
.
Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ. -- galatians 6:2
.
For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. -- galatians 6:3
.
But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another. -- galatians 6:4
.
For each one will bear his own load. -- galatians 6:5
.
The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him. -- galatians 6:6
.
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. -- galatians 6:7
.
For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. -- galatians 6:8
.
Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary. -- galatians 6:9
.
So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith. -- galatians 6:10
.
See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. -- galatians 6:11
.
Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. -- galatians 6:12
.
For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh. -- galatians 6:13
.
But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. -- galatians 6:14
.
For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. -- galatians 6:15
.
And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. -- galatians 6:16
.
From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus. -- galatians 6:17
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen. -- galatians 6:18
.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus: -- ephesians 1:1
.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- ephesians 1:2
.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, -- ephesians 1:3
.
just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love -- ephesians 1:4
.
He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, -- ephesians 1:5
.
to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. -- ephesians 1:6
.
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace -- ephesians 1:7
.
which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight -- ephesians 1:8
.
He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him -- ephesians 1:9
.
with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him -- ephesians 1:10
.
also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will, -- ephesians 1:11
.
to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory. -- ephesians 1:12
.
In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, -- ephesians 1:13
.
who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory. -- ephesians 1:14
.
For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints, -- ephesians 1:15
.
do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers; -- ephesians 1:16
.
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. -- ephesians 1:17
.
I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, -- ephesians 1:18
.
and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might -- ephesians 1:19
.
which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, -- ephesians 1:20
.
far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. -- ephesians 1:21
.
And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, -- ephesians 1:22
.
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. -- ephesians 1:23
.
And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, -- ephesians 2:1
.
in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. -- ephesians 2:2
.
Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. -- ephesians 2:3
.
But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, -- ephesians 2:4
.
even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), -- ephesians 2:5
.
and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, -- ephesians 2:6
.
so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. -- ephesians 2:7
.
For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; -- ephesians 2:8
.
not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. -- ephesians 2:9
.
For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. -- ephesians 2:10
.
Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "Uncircumcision" by the so-called "Circumcision," which is performed in the flesh by human hands-- -- ephesians 2:11
.
remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. -- ephesians 2:12
.
But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. -- ephesians 2:13
.
For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, -- ephesians 2:14
.
by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, -- ephesians 2:15
.
and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. -- ephesians 2:16
.
AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR; -- ephesians 2:17
.
for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. -- ephesians 2:18
.
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household, -- ephesians 2:19
.
having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone, -- ephesians 2:20
.
in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, -- ephesians 2:21
.
in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. -- ephesians 2:22
.
For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles-- -- ephesians 3:1
.
if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you; -- ephesians 3:2
.
that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. -- ephesians 3:3
.
By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, -- ephesians 3:4
.
which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; -- ephesians 3:5
.
to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, -- ephesians 3:6
.
of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. -- ephesians 3:7
.
To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, -- ephesians 3:8
.
and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; -- ephesians 3:9
.
so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places. -- ephesians 3:10
.
This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, -- ephesians 3:11
.
in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him. -- ephesians 3:12
.
Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory. -- ephesians 3:13
.
For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, -- ephesians 3:14
.
from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, -- ephesians 3:15
.
that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, -- ephesians 3:16
.
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, -- ephesians 3:17
.
may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, -- ephesians 3:18
.
and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. -- ephesians 3:19
.
Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, -- ephesians 3:20
.
to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. -- ephesians 3:21
.
Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, -- ephesians 4:1
.
with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, -- ephesians 4:2
.
being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. -- ephesians 4:3
.
There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; -- ephesians 4:4
.
one Lord, one faith, one baptism, -- ephesians 4:5
.
one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. -- ephesians 4:6
.
But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift. -- ephesians 4:7
.
Therefore it says, "WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN." -- ephesians 4:8
.
(Now this expression, "He ascended," what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? -- ephesians 4:9
.
He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.) -- ephesians 4:10
.
And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, -- ephesians 4:11
.
for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; -- ephesians 4:12
.
until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. -- ephesians 4:13
.
As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; -- ephesians 4:14
.
but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, -- ephesians 4:15
.
from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. -- ephesians 4:16
.
So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, -- ephesians 4:17
.
being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; -- ephesians 4:18
.
and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. -- ephesians 4:19
.
But you did not learn Christ in this way, -- ephesians 4:20
.
if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, -- ephesians 4:21
.
that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, -- ephesians 4:22
.
and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, -- ephesians 4:23
.
and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. -- ephesians 4:24
.
Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another. -- ephesians 4:25
.
BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger, -- ephesians 4:26
.
and do not give the devil an opportunity. -- ephesians 4:27
.
He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need. -- ephesians 4:28
.
Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear. -- ephesians 4:29
.
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. -- ephesians 4:30
.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. -- ephesians 4:31
.
Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. -- ephesians 4:32
.
Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; -- ephesians 5:1
.
and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. -- ephesians 5:2
.
But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints; -- ephesians 5:3
.
and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. -- ephesians 5:4
.
For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. -- ephesians 5:5
.
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. -- ephesians 5:6
.
Therefore do not be partakers with them; -- ephesians 5:7
.
for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light -- ephesians 5:8
.
(for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), -- ephesians 5:9
.
trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. -- ephesians 5:10
.
Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them; -- ephesians 5:11
.
for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. -- ephesians 5:12
.
But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. -- ephesians 5:13
.
For this reason it says, "Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you." -- ephesians 5:14
.
Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, -- ephesians 5:15
.
making the most of your time, because the days are evil. -- ephesians 5:16
.
So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. -- ephesians 5:17
.
And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, -- ephesians 5:18
.
speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; -- ephesians 5:19
.
always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; -- ephesians 5:20
.
and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. -- ephesians 5:21
.
Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. -- ephesians 5:22
.
For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. -- ephesians 5:23
.
But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything. -- ephesians 5:24
.
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, -- ephesians 5:25
.
so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, -- ephesians 5:26
.
that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. -- ephesians 5:27
.
So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; -- ephesians 5:28
.
for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, -- ephesians 5:29
.
because we are members of His body. -- ephesians 5:30
.
FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH. -- ephesians 5:31
.
This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. -- ephesians 5:32
.
Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband. -- ephesians 5:33
.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. -- ephesians 6:1
.
HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise), -- ephesians 6:2
.
SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH. -- ephesians 6:3
.
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. -- ephesians 6:4
.
Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; -- ephesians 6:5
.
not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. -- ephesians 6:6
.
With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, -- ephesians 6:7
.
knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. -- ephesians 6:8
.
And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him. -- ephesians 6:9
.
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. -- ephesians 6:10
.
Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. -- ephesians 6:11
.
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. -- ephesians 6:12
.
Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. -- ephesians 6:13
.
Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, -- ephesians 6:14
.
and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE; -- ephesians 6:15
.
in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. -- ephesians 6:16
.
And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. -- ephesians 6:17
.
With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, -- ephesians 6:18
.
and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, -- ephesians 6:19
.
for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. -- ephesians 6:20
.
But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you. -- ephesians 6:21
.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts. -- ephesians 6:22
.
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- ephesians 6:23
.
Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love. -- ephesians 6:24
.
Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons: -- philippians 1:1
.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- philippians 1:2
.
I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, -- philippians 1:3
.
always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all, -- philippians 1:4
.
in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now. -- philippians 1:5
.
For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. -- philippians 1:6
.
For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. -- philippians 1:7
.
For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. -- philippians 1:8
.
And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment, -- philippians 1:9
.
so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ; -- philippians 1:10
.
having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. -- philippians 1:11
.
Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel, -- philippians 1:12
.
so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else, -- philippians 1:13
.
and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear. -- philippians 1:14
.
Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will; -- philippians 1:15
.
the latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel; -- philippians 1:16
.
the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment. -- philippians 1:17
.
What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, -- philippians 1:18
.
for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, -- philippians 1:19
.
according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. -- philippians 1:20
.
For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. -- philippians 1:21
.
But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose. -- philippians 1:22
.
But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better; -- philippians 1:23
.
yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. -- philippians 1:24
.
Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith, -- philippians 1:25
.
so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again. -- philippians 1:26
.
Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; -- philippians 1:27
.
in no way alarmed by your opponents--which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that too, from God. -- philippians 1:28
.
For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake, -- philippians 1:29
.
experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me. -- philippians 1:30
.
Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, -- philippians 2:1
.
make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. -- philippians 2:2
.
Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; -- philippians 2:3
.
do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. -- philippians 2:4
.
Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, -- philippians 2:5
.
who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, -- philippians 2:6
.
but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. -- philippians 2:7
.
Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. -- philippians 2:8
.
For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, -- philippians 2:9
.
so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, -- philippians 2:10
.
and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. -- philippians 2:11
.
So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; -- philippians 2:12
.
for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure. -- philippians 2:13
.
Do all things without grumbling or disputing; -- philippians 2:14
.
so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world, -- philippians 2:15
.
holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. -- philippians 2:16
.
But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. -- philippians 2:17
.
You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me. -- philippians 2:18
.
But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition. -- philippians 2:19
.
For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare. -- philippians 2:20
.
For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus. -- philippians 2:21
.
But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father. -- philippians 2:22
.
Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me; -- philippians 2:23
.
and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly. -- philippians 2:24
.
But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need; -- philippians 2:25
.
because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. -- philippians 2:26
.
For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. -- philippians 2:27
.
Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you. -- philippians 2:28
.
Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard; -- philippians 2:29
.
because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me. -- philippians 2:30
.
Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you. -- philippians 3:1
.
Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision; -- philippians 3:2
.
for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh, -- philippians 3:3
.
although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more: -- philippians 3:4
.
circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee; -- philippians 3:5
.
as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless. -- philippians 3:6
.
But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. -- philippians 3:7
.
More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, -- philippians 3:8
.
and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, -- philippians 3:9
.
that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; -- philippians 3:10
.
in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. -- philippians 3:11
.
Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus. -- philippians 3:12
.
Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, -- philippians 3:13
.
I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. -- philippians 3:14
.
Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you; -- philippians 3:15
.
however, let us keep living by that same standard to which we have attained. -- philippians 3:16
.
Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us. -- philippians 3:17
.
For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, -- philippians 3:18
.
whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things. -- philippians 3:19
.
For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; -- philippians 3:20
.
who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself. -- philippians 3:21
.
Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long to see, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved. -- philippians 4:1
.
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord. -- philippians 4:2
.
Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life. -- philippians 4:3
.
Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! -- philippians 4:4
.
Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near. -- philippians 4:5
.
Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. -- philippians 4:6
.
And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. -- philippians 4:7
.
Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things. -- philippians 4:8
.
The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you. -- philippians 4:9
.
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity. -- philippians 4:10
.
Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. -- philippians 4:11
.
I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. -- philippians 4:12
.
I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. -- philippians 4:13
.
Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction. -- philippians 4:14
.
You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone; -- philippians 4:15
.
for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs. -- philippians 4:16
.
Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account. -- philippians 4:17
.
But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God. -- philippians 4:18
.
And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. -- philippians 4:19
.
Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen. -- philippians 4:20
.
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you. -- philippians 4:21
.
All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household. -- philippians 4:22
.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. -- philippians 4:23
.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, -- colossians 1:1
.
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father. -- colossians 1:2
.
We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, -- colossians 1:3
.
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints; -- colossians 1:4
.
because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel -- colossians 1:5
.
which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard of it and understood the grace of God in truth; -- colossians 1:6
.
just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf, -- colossians 1:7
.
and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit. -- colossians 1:8
.
For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, -- colossians 1:9
.
so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; -- colossians 1:10
.
strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously -- colossians 1:11
.
giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light. -- colossians 1:12
.
For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, -- colossians 1:13
.
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. -- colossians 1:14
.
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. -- colossians 1:15
.
For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things have been created through Him and for Him. -- colossians 1:16
.
He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. -- colossians 1:17
.
He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything. -- colossians 1:18
.
For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him, -- colossians 1:19
.
and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven. -- colossians 1:20
.
And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, -- colossians 1:21
.
yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach-- -- colossians 1:22
.
if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister. -- colossians 1:23
.
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions. -- colossians 1:24
.
Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, -- colossians 1:25
.
that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, -- colossians 1:26
.
to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. -- colossians 1:27
.
We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ. -- colossians 1:28
.
For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me. -- colossians 1:29
.
For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face, -- colossians 2:1
.
that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself, -- colossians 2:2
.
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. -- colossians 2:3
.
I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument. -- colossians 2:4
.
For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ. -- colossians 2:5
.
Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, -- colossians 2:6
.
having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude. -- colossians 2:7
.
See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ. -- colossians 2:8
.
For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, -- colossians 2:9
.
and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority; -- colossians 2:10
.
and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; -- colossians 2:11
.
having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. -- colossians 2:12
.
When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, -- colossians 2:13
.
having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. -- colossians 2:14
.
When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him. -- colossians 2:15
.
Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day-- -- colossians 2:16
.
things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. -- colossians 2:17
.
Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, -- colossians 2:18
.
and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God. -- colossians 2:19
.
If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, -- colossians 2:20
.
"Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!" -- colossians 2:21
.
(which all refer to things destined to perish with use)--in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men? -- colossians 2:22
.
These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence. -- colossians 2:23
.
Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. -- colossians 3:1
.
Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. -- colossians 3:2
.
For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. -- colossians 3:3
.
When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory. -- colossians 3:4
.
Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry. -- colossians 3:5
.
For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience, -- colossians 3:6
.
and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them. -- colossians 3:7
.
But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech from your mouth. -- colossians 3:8
.
Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices, -- colossians 3:9
.
and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him-- -- colossians 3:10
.
a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, and in all. -- colossians 3:11
.
So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience; -- colossians 3:12
.
bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you. -- colossians 3:13
.
Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. -- colossians 3:14
.
Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful. -- colossians 3:15
.
Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. -- colossians 3:16
.
Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father. -- colossians 3:17
.
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. -- colossians 3:18
.
Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them. -- colossians 3:19
.
Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. -- colossians 3:20
.
Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart. -- colossians 3:21
.
Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. -- colossians 3:22
.
Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, -- colossians 3:23
.
knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. -- colossians 3:24
.
For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality. -- colossians 3:25
.
Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven. -- colossians 4:1
.
Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving; -- colossians 4:2
.
praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned; -- colossians 4:3
.
that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak. -- colossians 4:4
.
Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. -- colossians 4:5
.
Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person. -- colossians 4:6
.
As to all my affairs, Tychicus, our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information. -- colossians 4:7
.
For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts; -- colossians 4:8
.
and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your number. They will inform you about the whole situation here. -- colossians 4:9
.
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas's cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him); -- colossians 4:10
.
and also Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me. -- colossians 4:11
.
Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. -- colossians 4:12
.
For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis. -- colossians 4:13
.
Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and also Demas. -- colossians 4:14
.
Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house. -- colossians 4:15
.
When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter that is coming from Laodicea. -- colossians 4:16
.
Say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it." -- colossians 4:17
.
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you. -- colossians 4:18
.
Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. -- 1 thessalonians 1:1
.
We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers; -- 1 thessalonians 1:2
.
constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father, -- 1 thessalonians 1:3
.
knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you; -- 1 thessalonians 1:4
.
for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. -- 1 thessalonians 1:5
.
You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit, -- 1 thessalonians 1:6
.
so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. -- 1 thessalonians 1:7
.
For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything. -- 1 thessalonians 1:8
.
For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, -- 1 thessalonians 1:9
.
and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come. -- 1 thessalonians 1:10
.
For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain, -- 1 thessalonians 2:1
.
but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition. -- 1 thessalonians 2:2
.
For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit; -- 1 thessalonians 2:3
.
but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts. -- 1 thessalonians 2:4
.
For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed--God is witness-- -- 1 thessalonians 2:5
.
nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority. -- 1 thessalonians 2:6
.
But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children. -- 1 thessalonians 2:7
.
Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us. -- 1 thessalonians 2:8
.
For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. -- 1 thessalonians 2:9
.
You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers; -- 1 thessalonians 2:10
.
just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his own children, -- 1 thessalonians 2:11
.
so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. -- 1 thessalonians 2:12
.
For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe. -- 1 thessalonians 2:13
.
For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews, -- 1 thessalonians 2:14
.
who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men, -- 1 thessalonians 2:15
.
hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost. -- 1 thessalonians 2:16
.
But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short while--in person, not in spirit--were all the more eager with great desire to see your face. -- 1 thessalonians 2:17
.
For we wanted to come to you--I, Paul, more than once--and yet Satan hindered us. -- 1 thessalonians 2:18
.
For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? -- 1 thessalonians 2:19
.
For you are our glory and joy. -- 1 thessalonians 2:20
.
Therefore when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone, -- 1 thessalonians 3:1
.
and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith, -- 1 thessalonians 3:2
.
so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this. -- 1 thessalonians 3:3
.
For indeed when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know. -- 1 thessalonians 3:4
.
For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain. -- 1 thessalonians 3:5
.
But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also long to see you, -- 1 thessalonians 3:6
.
for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith; -- 1 thessalonians 3:7
.
for now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord. -- 1 thessalonians 3:8
.
For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account, -- 1 thessalonians 3:9
.
as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith? -- 1 thessalonians 3:10
.
Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you; -- 1 thessalonians 3:11
.
and may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also do for you; -- 1 thessalonians 3:12
.
so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints. -- 1 thessalonians 3:13
.
Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us instruction as to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually do walk), that you excel still more. -- 1 thessalonians 4:1
.
For you know what commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus. -- 1 thessalonians 4:2
.
For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality; -- 1 thessalonians 4:3
.
that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, -- 1 thessalonians 4:4
.
not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God; -- 1 thessalonians 4:5
.
and that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you. -- 1 thessalonians 4:6
.
For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification. -- 1 thessalonians 4:7
.
So, he who rejects this is not rejecting man but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you. -- 1 thessalonians 4:8
.
Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another; -- 1 thessalonians 4:9
.
for indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more, -- 1 thessalonians 4:10
.
and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands, just as we commanded you, -- 1 thessalonians 4:11
.
so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need. -- 1 thessalonians 4:12
.
But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope. -- 1 thessalonians 4:13
.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. -- 1 thessalonians 4:14
.
For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. -- 1 thessalonians 4:15
.
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. -- 1 thessalonians 4:16
.
Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord. -- 1 thessalonians 4:17
.
Therefore comfort one another with these words. -- 1 thessalonians 4:18
.
Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you. -- 1 thessalonians 5:1
.
For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night. -- 1 thessalonians 5:2
.
While they are saying, "Peace and safety!" then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape. -- 1 thessalonians 5:3
.
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would overtake you like a thief; -- 1 thessalonians 5:4
.
for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness; -- 1 thessalonians 5:5
.
so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober. -- 1 thessalonians 5:6
.
For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night. -- 1 thessalonians 5:7
.
But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation. -- 1 thessalonians 5:8
.
For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, -- 1 thessalonians 5:9
.
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him. -- 1 thessalonians 5:10
.
Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing. -- 1 thessalonians 5:11
.
But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction, -- 1 thessalonians 5:12
.
and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another. -- 1 thessalonians 5:13
.
We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. -- 1 thessalonians 5:14
.
See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people. -- 1 thessalonians 5:15
.
Rejoice always; -- 1 thessalonians 5:16
.
pray without ceasing; -- 1 thessalonians 5:17
.
in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. -- 1 thessalonians 5:18
.
Do not quench the Spirit; -- 1 thessalonians 5:19
.
do not despise prophetic utterances. -- 1 thessalonians 5:20
.
But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good; -- 1 thessalonians 5:21
.
abstain from every form of evil. -- 1 thessalonians 5:22
.
Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1 thessalonians 5:23
.
Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass. -- 1 thessalonians 5:24
.
Brethren, pray for us. -- 1 thessalonians 5:25
.
Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss. -- 1 thessalonians 5:26
.
I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren. -- 1 thessalonians 5:27
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. -- 1 thessalonians 5:28
.
Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: -- 2 thessalonians 1:1
.
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 1:2
.
We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater; -- 2 thessalonians 1:3
.
therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure. -- 2 thessalonians 1:4
.
This is a plain indication of God's righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering. -- 2 thessalonians 1:5
.
For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, -- 2 thessalonians 1:6
.
and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, -- 2 thessalonians 1:7
.
dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. -- 2 thessalonians 1:8
.
These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, -- 2 thessalonians 1:9
.
when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed--for our testimony to you was believed. -- 2 thessalonians 1:10
.
To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power, -- 2 thessalonians 1:11
.
so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 1:12
.
Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, -- 2 thessalonians 2:1
.
that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. -- 2 thessalonians 2:2
.
Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, -- 2 thessalonians 2:3
.
who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God. -- 2 thessalonians 2:4
.
Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things? -- 2 thessalonians 2:5
.
And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed. -- 2 thessalonians 2:6
.
For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way. -- 2 thessalonians 2:7
.
Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming; -- 2 thessalonians 2:8
.
that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, -- 2 thessalonians 2:9
.
and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. -- 2 thessalonians 2:10
.
For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, -- 2 thessalonians 2:11
.
in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness. -- 2 thessalonians 2:12
.
But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. -- 2 thessalonians 2:13
.
It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 2:14
.
So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us. -- 2 thessalonians 2:15
.
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, -- 2 thessalonians 2:16
.
comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word. -- 2 thessalonians 2:17
.
Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it did also with you; -- 2 thessalonians 3:1
.
and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not all have faith. -- 2 thessalonians 3:2
.
But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one. -- 2 thessalonians 3:3
.
We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command. -- 2 thessalonians 3:4
.
May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ. -- 2 thessalonians 3:5
.
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us. -- 2 thessalonians 3:6
.
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you, -- 2 thessalonians 3:7
.
nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you; -- 2 thessalonians 3:8
.
not because we do not have the right to this, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you, so that you would follow our example. -- 2 thessalonians 3:9
.
For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. -- 2 thessalonians 3:10
.
For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies. -- 2 thessalonians 3:11
.
Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread. -- 2 thessalonians 3:12
.
But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good. -- 2 thessalonians 3:13
.
If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame. -- 2 thessalonians 3:14
.
Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. -- 2 thessalonians 3:15
.
Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all! -- 2 thessalonians 3:16
.
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write. -- 2 thessalonians 3:17
.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. -- 2 thessalonians 3:18
.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope, -- 1 timothy 1:1
.
To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. -- 1 timothy 1:2
.
As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, -- 1 timothy 1:3
.
nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith. -- 1 timothy 1:4
.
But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. -- 1 timothy 1:5
.
For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, -- 1 timothy 1:6
.
wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions. -- 1 timothy 1:7
.
But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, -- 1 timothy 1:8
.
realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers -- 1 timothy 1:9
.
and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, -- 1 timothy 1:10
.
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted. -- 1 timothy 1:11
.
I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, -- 1 timothy 1:12
.
even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; -- 1 timothy 1:13
.
and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus. -- 1 timothy 1:14
.
It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all. -- 1 timothy 1:15
.
Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life. -- 1 timothy 1:16
.
Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. -- 1 timothy 1:17
.
This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight, -- 1 timothy 1:18
.
keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. -- 1 timothy 1:19
.
Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme. -- 1 timothy 1:20
.
First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, -- 1 timothy 2:1
.
for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. -- 1 timothy 2:2
.
This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, -- 1 timothy 2:3
.
who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. -- 1 timothy 2:4
.
For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, -- 1 timothy 2:5
.
who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time. -- 1 timothy 2:6
.
For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. -- 1 timothy 2:7
.
Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension. -- 1 timothy 2:8
.
Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, -- 1 timothy 2:9
.
but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness. -- 1 timothy 2:10
.
A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness. -- 1 timothy 2:11
.
But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet. -- 1 timothy 2:12
.
For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve. -- 1 timothy 2:13
.
And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. -- 1 timothy 2:14
.
But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint. -- 1 timothy 2:15
.
It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do. -- 1 timothy 3:1
.
An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, -- 1 timothy 3:2
.
not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money. -- 1 timothy 3:3
.
He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity -- 1 timothy 3:4
.
(but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?), -- 1 timothy 3:5
.
and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil. -- 1 timothy 3:6
.
And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. -- 1 timothy 3:7
.
Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain, -- 1 timothy 3:8
.
but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. -- 1 timothy 3:9
.
These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach. -- 1 timothy 3:10
.
Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things. -- 1 timothy 3:11
.
Deacons must be husbands of only one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households. -- 1 timothy 3:12
.
For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. -- 1 timothy 3:13
.
I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long; -- 1 timothy 3:14
.
but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth. -- 1 timothy 3:15
.
By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory. -- 1 timothy 3:16
.
But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, -- 1 timothy 4:1
.
by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron, -- 1 timothy 4:2
.
men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth. -- 1 timothy 4:3
.
For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude; -- 1 timothy 4:4
.
for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer. -- 1 timothy 4:5
.
In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following. -- 1 timothy 4:6
.
But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness; -- 1 timothy 4:7
.
for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. -- 1 timothy 4:8
.
It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance. -- 1 timothy 4:9
.
For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers. -- 1 timothy 4:10
.
Prescribe and teach these things. -- 1 timothy 4:11
.
Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe. -- 1 timothy 4:12
.
Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching. -- 1 timothy 4:13
.
Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery. -- 1 timothy 4:14
.
Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all. -- 1 timothy 4:15
.
Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you. -- 1 timothy 4:16
.
Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather appeal to him as a father, to the younger men as brothers, -- 1 timothy 5:1
.
the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, in all purity. -- 1 timothy 5:2
.
Honor widows who are widows indeed; -- 1 timothy 5:3
.
but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. -- 1 timothy 5:4
.
Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day. -- 1 timothy 5:5
.
But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives. -- 1 timothy 5:6
.
Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach. -- 1 timothy 5:7
.
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. -- 1 timothy 5:8
.
A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one man, -- 1 timothy 5:9
.
having a reputation for good works; and if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has assisted those in distress, and if she has devoted herself to every good work. -- 1 timothy 5:10
.
But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married, -- 1 timothy 5:11
.
thus incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge. -- 1 timothy 5:12
.
At the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper to mention. -- 1 timothy 5:13
.
Therefore, I want younger widows to get married, bear children, keep house, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach; -- 1 timothy 5:14
.
for some have already turned aside to follow Satan. -- 1 timothy 5:15
.
If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed. -- 1 timothy 5:16
.
The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. -- 1 timothy 5:17
.
For the Scripture says, "YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING," and "The laborer is worthy of his wages." -- 1 timothy 5:18
.
Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses. -- 1 timothy 5:19
.
Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful of sinning. -- 1 timothy 5:20
.
I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His chosen angels, to maintain these principles without bias, doing nothing in a spirit of partiality. -- 1 timothy 5:21
.
Do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin. -- 1 timothy 5:22
.
No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments. -- 1 timothy 5:23
.
The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins follow after. -- 1 timothy 5:24
.
Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed. -- 1 timothy 5:25
.
All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against. -- 1 timothy 6:1
.
Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these principles. -- 1 timothy 6:2
.
If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, -- 1 timothy 6:3
.
he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions, -- 1 timothy 6:4
.
and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. -- 1 timothy 6:5
.
But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment. -- 1 timothy 6:6
.
For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it either. -- 1 timothy 6:7
.
If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content. -- 1 timothy 6:8
.
But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction. -- 1 timothy 6:9
.
For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. -- 1 timothy 6:10
.
But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness. -- 1 timothy 6:11
.
Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. -- 1 timothy 6:12
.
I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, -- 1 timothy 6:13
.
that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- 1 timothy 6:14
.
which He will bring about at the proper time--He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, -- 1 timothy 6:15
.
who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen. -- 1 timothy 6:16
.
Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. -- 1 timothy 6:17
.
Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, -- 1 timothy 6:18
.
storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed. -- 1 timothy 6:19
.
O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called "knowledge"-- -- 1 timothy 6:20
.
which some have professed and thus gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you. -- 1 timothy 6:21
.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus, -- 2 timothy 1:1
.
To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. -- 2 timothy 1:2
.
I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day, -- 2 timothy 1:3
.
longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy. -- 2 timothy 1:4
.
For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well. -- 2 timothy 1:5
.
For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. -- 2 timothy 1:6
.
For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline. -- 2 timothy 1:7
.
Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, -- 2 timothy 1:8
.
who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity, -- 2 timothy 1:9
.
but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, -- 2 timothy 1:10
.
for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher. -- 2 timothy 1:11
.
For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day. -- 2 timothy 1:12
.
Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 1:13
.
Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you. -- 2 timothy 1:14
.
You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. -- 2 timothy 1:15
.
The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains; -- 2 timothy 1:16
.
but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me-- -- 2 timothy 1:17
.
the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day--and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus. -- 2 timothy 1:18
.
You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 2:1
.
The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. -- 2 timothy 2:2
.
Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 2:3
.
No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. -- 2 timothy 2:4
.
Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules. -- 2 timothy 2:5
.
The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops. -- 2 timothy 2:6
.
Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. -- 2 timothy 2:7
.
Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel, -- 2 timothy 2:8
.
for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned. -- 2 timothy 2:9
.
For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory. -- 2 timothy 2:10
.
It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him; -- 2 timothy 2:11
.
If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us; -- 2 timothy 2:12
.
If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself. -- 2 timothy 2:13
.
Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers. -- 2 timothy 2:14
.
Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. -- 2 timothy 2:15
.
But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness, -- 2 timothy 2:16
.
and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, -- 2 timothy 2:17
.
men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some. -- 2 timothy 2:18
.
Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness." -- 2 timothy 2:19
.
Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor. -- 2 timothy 2:20
.
Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. -- 2 timothy 2:21
.
Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. -- 2 timothy 2:22
.
But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels. -- 2 timothy 2:23
.
The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, -- 2 timothy 2:24
.
with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, -- 2 timothy 2:25
.
and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will. -- 2 timothy 2:26
.
But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. -- 2 timothy 3:1
.
For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, -- 2 timothy 3:2
.
unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, -- 2 timothy 3:3
.
treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, -- 2 timothy 3:4
.
holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these. -- 2 timothy 3:5
.
For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, -- 2 timothy 3:6
.
always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. -- 2 timothy 3:7
.
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith. -- 2 timothy 3:8
.
But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes's and Jambres's folly was also. -- 2 timothy 3:9
.
Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance, -- 2 timothy 3:10
.
persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me! -- 2 timothy 3:11
.
Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. -- 2 timothy 3:12
.
But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. -- 2 timothy 3:13
.
You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, -- 2 timothy 3:14
.
and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. -- 2 timothy 3:15
.
All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; -- 2 timothy 3:16
.
so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. -- 2 timothy 3:17
.
I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: -- 2 timothy 4:1
.
preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction. -- 2 timothy 4:2
.
For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, -- 2 timothy 4:3
.
and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. -- 2 timothy 4:4
.
But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. -- 2 timothy 4:5
.
For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. -- 2 timothy 4:6
.
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; -- 2 timothy 4:7
.
in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. -- 2 timothy 4:8
.
Make every effort to come to me soon; -- 2 timothy 4:9
.
for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. -- 2 timothy 4:10
.
Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. -- 2 timothy 4:11
.
But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. -- 2 timothy 4:12
.
When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments. -- 2 timothy 4:13
.
Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. -- 2 timothy 4:14
.
Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching. -- 2 timothy 4:15
.
At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them. -- 2 timothy 4:16
.
But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion's mouth. -- 2 timothy 4:17
.
The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. -- 2 timothy 4:18
.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. -- 2 timothy 4:19
.
Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus. -- 2 timothy 4:20
.
Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren. -- 2 timothy 4:21
.
The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you. -- 2 timothy 4:22
.
Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, -- titus 1:1
.
in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago, -- titus 1:2
.
but at the proper time manifested, even His word, in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior, -- titus 1:3
.
To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. -- titus 1:4
.
For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you, -- titus 1:5
.
namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion. -- titus 1:6
.
For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain, -- titus 1:7
.
but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled, -- titus 1:8
.
holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict. -- titus 1:9
.
For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, -- titus 1:10
.
who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not teach for the sake of sordid gain. -- titus 1:11
.
One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." -- titus 1:12
.
This testimony is true. For this reason reprove them severely so that they may be sound in the faith, -- titus 1:13
.
not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. -- titus 1:14
.
To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. -- titus 1:15
.
They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed. -- titus 1:16
.
But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. -- titus 2:1
.
Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance. -- titus 2:2
.
Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, -- titus 2:3
.
so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, -- titus 2:4
.
to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored. -- titus 2:5
.
Likewise urge the young men to be sensible; -- titus 2:6
.
in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified, -- titus 2:7
.
sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. -- titus 2:8
.
Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, -- titus 2:9
.
not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect. -- titus 2:10
.
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, -- titus 2:11
.
instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, -- titus 2:12
.
looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, -- titus 2:13
.
who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds. -- titus 2:14
.
These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you. -- titus 2:15
.
Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed, -- titus 3:1
.
to malign no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing every consideration for all men. -- titus 3:2
.
For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. -- titus 3:3
.
But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, -- titus 3:4
.
He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, -- titus 3:5
.
whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, -- titus 3:6
.
so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. -- titus 3:7
.
This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men. -- titus 3:8
.
But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. -- titus 3:9
.
Reject a factious man after a first and second warning, -- titus 3:10
.
knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned. -- titus 3:11
.
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. -- titus 3:12
.
Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them. -- titus 3:13
.
Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful. -- titus 3:14
.
All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. -- titus 3:15
.
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker, -- philemon 1:1
.
and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: -- philemon 1:2
.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. -- philemon 1:3
.
I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, -- philemon 1:4
.
because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints; -- philemon 1:5
.
and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ's sake. -- philemon 1:6
.
For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. -- philemon 1:7
.
Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper, -- philemon 1:8
.
yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you--since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus-- -- philemon 1:9
.
I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment, -- philemon 1:10
.
who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me. -- philemon 1:11
.
I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart, -- philemon 1:12
.
whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel; -- philemon 1:13
.
but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will. -- philemon 1:14
.
For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you for a while, that you would have him back forever, -- philemon 1:15
.
no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. -- philemon 1:16
.
If then you regard me a partner, accept him as you would me. -- philemon 1:17
.
But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account; -- philemon 1:18
.
I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well). -- philemon 1:19
.
Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. -- philemon 1:20
.
Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say. -- philemon 1:21
.
At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you. -- philemon 1:22
.
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, -- philemon 1:23
.
as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers. -- philemon 1:24
.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. -- philemon 1:25
.
God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, -- hebrews 1:1
.
in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world. -- hebrews 1:2
.
And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, -- hebrews 1:3
.
having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they. -- hebrews 1:4
.
For to which of the angels did He ever say, "YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU"? And again, "I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME"? -- hebrews 1:5
.
And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, "AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM." -- hebrews 1:6
.
And of the angels He says, "WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS, AND HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE." -- hebrews 1:7
.
But of the Son He says, "YOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM. -- hebrews 1:8
.
"YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS; THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS." -- hebrews 1:9
.
And, "YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS; -- hebrews 1:10
.
THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN; AND THEY ALL WILL BECOME OLD LIKE A GARMENT, -- hebrews 1:11
.
AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP; LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END." -- hebrews 1:12
.
But to which of the angels has He ever said, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET"? -- hebrews 1:13
.
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation? -- hebrews 1:14
.
For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it. -- hebrews 2:1
.
For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty, -- hebrews 2:2
.
how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard, -- hebrews 2:3
.
God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will. -- hebrews 2:4
.
For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking. -- hebrews 2:5
.
But one has testified somewhere, saying, "WHAT IS MAN, THAT YOU REMEMBER HIM? OR THE SON OF MAN, THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM? -- hebrews 2:6
.
"YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS; -- hebrews 2:7
.
YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET." For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him. -- hebrews 2:8
.
But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone. -- hebrews 2:9
.
For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings. -- hebrews 2:10
.
For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren, -- hebrews 2:11
.
saying, "I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE." -- hebrews 2:12
.
And again, "I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM." And again, "BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME." -- hebrews 2:13
.
Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, -- hebrews 2:14
.
and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. -- hebrews 2:15
.
For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham. -- hebrews 2:16
.
Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. -- hebrews 2:17
.
For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted. -- hebrews 2:18
.
Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; -- hebrews 3:1
.
He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house. -- hebrews 3:2
.
For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. -- hebrews 3:3
.
For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. -- hebrews 3:4
.
