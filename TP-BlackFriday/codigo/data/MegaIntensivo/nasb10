And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law, -- luke 2:27
.
then he took Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, -- luke 2:28
.
"Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in peace, According to Your word; -- luke 2:29
.
For my eyes have seen Your salvation, -- luke 2:30
.
Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples, -- luke 2:31
.
A LIGHT OF REVELATION TO THE GENTILES, And the glory of Your people Israel." -- luke 2:32
.
And His father and mother were amazed at the things which were being said about Him. -- luke 2:33
.
And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed-- -- luke 2:34
.
and a sword will pierce even your own soul--to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed." -- luke 2:35
.
And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years and had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, -- luke 2:36
.
and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers. -- luke 2:37
.
At that very moment she came up and began giving thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. -- luke 2:38
.
When they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth. -- luke 2:39
.
The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him. -- luke 2:40
.
Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. -- luke 2:41
.
And when He became twelve, they went up there according to the custom of the Feast; -- luke 2:42
.
and as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But His parents were unaware of it, -- luke 2:43
.
but supposed Him to be in the caravan, and went a day's journey; and they began looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances. -- luke 2:44
.
When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem looking for Him. -- luke 2:45
.
Then, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. -- luke 2:46
.
And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers. -- luke 2:47
.
When they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, "Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You." -- luke 2:48
.
And He said to them, "Why is it that you were looking for Me? Did you not know that I had to be in My Father's house?" -- luke 2:49
.
But they did not understand the statement which He had made to them. -- luke 2:50
.
And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He continued in subjection to them; and His mother treasured all these things in her heart. -- luke 2:51
.
And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. -- luke 2:52
.
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, -- luke 3:1
.
in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. -- luke 3:2
.
And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins; -- luke 3:3
.
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT. -- luke 3:4
.
'EVERY RAVINE WILL BE FILLED, AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL WILL BE BROUGHT LOW; THE CROOKED WILL BECOME STRAIGHT, AND THE ROUGH ROADS SMOOTH; -- luke 3:5
.
AND ALL FLESH WILL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD.'" -- luke 3:6
.
So he began saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? -- luke 3:7
.
"Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham. -- luke 3:8
.
"Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; so every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." -- luke 3:9
.
And the crowds were questioning him, saying, "Then what shall we do?" -- luke 3:10
.
And he would answer and say to them, "The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise." -- luke 3:11
.
And some tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?" -- luke 3:12
.
And he said to them, "Collect no more than what you have been ordered to." -- luke 3:13
.
Some soldiers were questioning him, saying, "And what about us, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Do not take money from anyone by force, or accuse anyone falsely, and be content with your wages." -- luke 3:14
.
Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ, -- luke 3:15
.
John answered and said to them all, "As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. -- luke 3:16
.
"His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." -- luke 3:17
.
So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people. -- luke 3:18
.
But when Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done, -- luke 3:19
.
Herod also added this to them all: he locked John up in prison. -- luke 3:20
.
Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened, -- luke 3:21
.
and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven, "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased." -- luke 3:22
.
When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli, -- luke 3:23
.
the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, -- luke 3:24
.
the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Hesli, the son of Naggai, -- luke 3:25
.
the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, -- luke 3:26
.
the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, -- luke 3:27
.
the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, -- luke 3:28
.
the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, -- luke 3:29
.
the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, -- luke 3:30
.
the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, -- luke 3:31
.
the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, -- luke 3:32
.
the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, -- luke 3:33
.
the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, -- luke 3:34
.
the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Shelah, -- luke 3:35
.
the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, -- luke 3:36
.
the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, -- luke 3:37
.
the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. -- luke 3:38
.
Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness -- luke 4:1
.
for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He became hungry. -- luke 4:2
.
And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread." -- luke 4:3
.
And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE.'" -- luke 4:4
.
And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. -- luke 4:5
.
And the devil said to Him, "I will give You all this domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. -- luke 4:6
.
"Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours." -- luke 4:7
.
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'" -- luke 4:8
.
And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here; -- luke 4:9
.
for it is written, 'HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU,' -- luke 4:10
.
and, 'ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.'" -- luke 4:11
.
And Jesus answered and said to him, "It is said, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'" -- luke 4:12
.
When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time. -- luke 4:13
.
And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district. -- luke 4:14
.
And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all. -- luke 4:15
.
And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read. -- luke 4:16
.
And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the book and found the place where it was written, -- luke 4:17
.
"THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED, -- luke 4:18
.
TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD." -- luke 4:19
.
And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him. -- luke 4:20
.
And He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing." -- luke 4:21
.
And all were speaking well of Him, and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from His lips; and they were saying, "Is this not Joseph's son?" -- luke 4:22
.
And He said to them, "No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we heard was done at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.'" -- luke 4:23
.
And He said, "Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown. -- luke 4:24
.
"But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land; -- luke 4:25
.
and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. -- luke 4:26
.
"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian." -- luke 4:27
.
And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things; -- luke 4:28
.
and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff. -- luke 4:29
.
But passing through their midst, He went His way. -- luke 4:30
.
And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath; -- luke 4:31
.
and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority. -- luke 4:32
.
In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, -- luke 4:33
.
"Let us alone! What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!" -- luke 4:34
.
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people, he came out of him without doing him any harm. -- luke 4:35
.
And amazement came upon them all, and they began talking with one another saying, "What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out." -- luke 4:36
.
And the report about Him was spreading into every locality in the surrounding district. -- luke 4:37
.
Then He got up and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's home. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him to help her. -- luke 4:38
.
And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she immediately got up and waited on them. -- luke 4:39
.
While the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and laying His hands on each one of them, He was healing them. -- luke 4:40
.
Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ. -- luke 4:41
.
When day came, Jesus left and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were searching for Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from them. -- luke 4:42
.
But He said to them, "I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose." -- luke 4:43
.
So He kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. -- luke 4:44
.
Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret; -- luke 5:1
.
and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. -- luke 5:2
.
And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and began teaching the people from the boat. -- luke 5:3
.
When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch." -- luke 5:4
.
Simon answered and said, "Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say and let down the nets." -- luke 5:5
.
When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish, and their nets began to break; -- luke 5:6
.
so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink. -- luke 5:7
.
But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus' feet, saying, "Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!" -- luke 5:8
.
For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken; -- luke 5:9
.
and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men." -- luke 5:10
.
When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him. -- luke 5:11
.
While He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man covered with leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean." -- luke 5:12
.
And He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately the leprosy left him. -- luke 5:13
.
And He ordered him to tell no one, "But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." -- luke 5:14
.
But the news about Him was spreading even farther, and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses. -- luke 5:15
.
But Jesus Himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray. -- luke 5:16
.
One day He was teaching; and there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing. -- luke 5:17
.
And some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him. -- luke 5:18
.
But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher, into the middle of the crowd, in front of Jesus. -- luke 5:19
.
Seeing their faith, He said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven you." -- luke 5:20
.
The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?" -- luke 5:21
.
But Jesus, aware of their reasonings, answered and said to them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts? -- luke 5:22
.
"Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins have been forgiven you,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? -- luke 5:23
.
"But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,"--He said to the paralytic--"I say to you, get up, and pick up your stretcher and go home." -- luke 5:24
.
Immediately he got up before them, and picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God. -- luke 5:25
.
They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen remarkable things today." -- luke 5:26
.
After that He went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax booth, and He said to him, "Follow Me." -- luke 5:27
.
And he left everything behind, and got up and began to follow Him. -- luke 5:28
.
And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them. -- luke 5:29
.
The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at His disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?" -- luke 5:30
.
And Jesus answered and said to them, "It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick. -- luke 5:31
.
"I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance." -- luke 5:32
.
And they said to Him, "The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers, the disciples of the Pharisees also do the same, but Yours eat and drink." -- luke 5:33
.
And Jesus said to them, "You cannot make the attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you? -- luke 5:34
.
"But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days." -- luke 5:35
.
And He was also telling them a parable: "No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise he will both tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old. -- luke 5:36
.
"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out, and the skins will be ruined. -- luke 5:37
.
"But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. -- luke 5:38
.
"And no one, after drinking old wine wishes for new; for he says, 'The old is good enough.'" -- luke 5:39
.
Now it happened that He was passing through some grainfields on a Sabbath; and His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating the grain. -- luke 6:1
.
But some of the Pharisees said, "Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?" -- luke 6:2
.
And Jesus answering them said, "Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him, -- luke 6:3
.
how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the consecrated bread which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?" -- luke 6:4
.
And He was saying to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." -- luke 6:5
.
On another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. -- luke 6:6
.
The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He healed on the Sabbath, so that they might find reason to accuse Him. -- luke 6:7
.
But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, "Get up and come forward!" And he got up and came forward. -- luke 6:8
.
And Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?" -- luke 6:9
.
After looking around at them all, He said to him, "Stretch out your hand!" And he did so; and his hand was restored. -- luke 6:10
.
But they themselves were filled with rage, and discussed together what they might do to Jesus. -- luke 6:11
.
It was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God. -- luke 6:12
.
And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles: -- luke 6:13
.
Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew; -- luke 6:14
.
and Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot; -- luke 6:15
.
Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. -- luke 6:16
.
Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place; and there was a large crowd of His disciples, and a great throng of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon, -- luke 6:17
.
who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured. -- luke 6:18
.
And all the people were trying to touch Him, for power was coming from Him and healing them all. -- luke 6:19
.
And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He began to say, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. -- luke 6:20
.
"Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh. -- luke 6:21
.
"Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man. -- luke 6:22
.
"Be glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets. -- luke 6:23
.
"But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full. -- luke 6:24
.
"Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep. -- luke 6:25
.
"Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way. -- luke 6:26
.
"But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, -- luke 6:27
.
bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. -- luke 6:28
.
"Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also; and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either. -- luke 6:29
.
"Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back. -- luke 6:30
.
"Treat others the same way you want them to treat you. -- luke 6:31
.
"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. -- luke 6:32
.
"If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. -- luke 6:33
.
"If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount. -- luke 6:34
.
"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men. -- luke 6:35
.
"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. -- luke 6:36
.
"Do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned. -- luke 6:37
.
"Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure--pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return." -- luke 6:38
.
And He also spoke a parable to them: "A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit? -- luke 6:39
.
"A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been fully trained, will be like his teacher. -- luke 6:40
.
"Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? -- luke 6:41
.
"Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye. -- luke 6:42
.
"For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit. -- luke 6:43
.
"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush. -- luke 6:44
.
"The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart. -- luke 6:45
.
"Why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? -- luke 6:46
.
"Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like: -- luke 6:47
.
he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. -- luke 6:48
.
"But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly, is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great." -- luke 6:49
.
When He had completed all His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum. -- luke 7:1
.
And a centurion's slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die. -- luke 7:2
.
When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders asking Him to come and save the life of his slave. -- luke 7:3
.
When they came to Jesus, they earnestly implored Him, saying, "He is worthy for You to grant this to him; -- luke 7:4
.
for he loves our nation and it was he who built us our synagogue." -- luke 7:5
.
Now Jesus started on His way with them; and when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof; -- luke 7:6
.
for this reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed. -- luke 7:7
.
"For I also am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it." -- luke 7:8
.
Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him, "I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith." -- luke 7:9
.
When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health. -- luke 7:10
.
Soon afterwards He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were going along with Him, accompanied by a large crowd. -- luke 7:11
.
Now as He approached the gate of the city, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her. -- luke 7:12
.
When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her, and said to her, "Do not weep." -- luke 7:13
.
And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise!" -- luke 7:14
.
The dead man sat up and began to speak. And Jesus gave him back to his mother. -- luke 7:15
.
Fear gripped them all, and they began glorifying God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us!" and, "God has visited His people!" -- luke 7:16
.
This report concerning Him went out all over Judea and in all the surrounding district. -- luke 7:17
.
The disciples of John reported to him about all these things. -- luke 7:18
.
Summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, "Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?" -- luke 7:19
.
When the men came to Him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, to ask, 'Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?'" -- luke 7:20
.
At that very time He cured many people of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits; and He gave sight to many who were blind. -- luke 7:21
.
And He answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM. -- luke 7:22
.
"Blessed is he who does not take offense at Me." -- luke 7:23
.
When the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? -- luke 7:24
.
"But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces! -- luke 7:25
.
"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet. -- luke 7:26
.
"This is the one about whom it is written, 'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.' -- luke 7:27
.
"I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he." -- luke 7:28
.
When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they acknowledged God's justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John. -- luke 7:29
.
But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John. -- luke 7:30
.
"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like? -- luke 7:31
.
"They are like children who sit in the market place and call to one another, and they say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.' -- luke 7:32
.
"For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon!' -- luke 7:33
.
"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' -- luke 7:34
.
"Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children." -- luke 7:35
.
Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him, and He entered the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. -- luke 7:36
.
And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume, -- luke 7:37
.
and standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume. -- luke 7:38
.
Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner." -- luke 7:39
.
And Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he replied, "Say it, Teacher." -- luke 7:40
.
"A moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. -- luke 7:41
.
"When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both. So which of them will love him more?" -- luke 7:42
.
Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave more." And He said to him, "You have judged correctly." -- luke 7:43
.
Turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. -- luke 7:44
.
"You gave Me no kiss; but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet. -- luke 7:45
.
"You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume. -- luke 7:46
.
"For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little." -- luke 7:47
.
Then He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven." -- luke 7:48
.
Those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say to themselves, "Who is this man who even forgives sins?" -- luke 7:49
.
And He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." -- luke 7:50
.
Soon afterwards, He began going around from one city and village to another, proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God. The twelve were with Him, -- luke 8:1
.
and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, -- luke 8:2
.
and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means. -- luke 8:3
.
When a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable: -- luke 8:4
.
"The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up. -- luke 8:5
.
"Other seed fell on rocky soil, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. -- luke 8:6
.
"Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out. -- luke 8:7
.
"Other seed fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great." As He said these things, He would call out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." -- luke 8:8
.
His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant. -- luke 8:9
.
And He said, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE, AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND. -- luke 8:10
.
"Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God. -- luke 8:11
.
"Those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved. -- luke 8:12
.
"Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away. -- luke 8:13
.
"The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity. -- luke 8:14
.
"But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance. -- luke 8:15
.
"Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light. -- luke 8:16
.
"For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light. -- luke 8:17
.
"So take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him." -- luke 8:18
.
And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd. -- luke 8:19
.
And it was reported to Him, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You." -- luke 8:20
.
But He answered and said to them, "My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it." -- luke 8:21
.
Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out. -- luke 8:22
.
But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake, and they began to be swamped and to be in danger. -- luke 8:23
.
They came to Jesus and woke Him up, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm. -- luke 8:24
.
And He said to them, "Where is your faith?" They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?" -- luke 8:25
.
Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. -- luke 8:26
.
And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs. -- luke 8:27
.
Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me." -- luke 8:28
.
For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and yet he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert. -- luke 8:29
.
And Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion"; for many demons had entered him. -- luke 8:30
.
They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into the abyss. -- luke 8:31
.
Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain; and the demons implored Him to permit them to enter the swine. And He gave them permission. -- luke 8:32
.
And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. -- luke 8:33
.
When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and out in the country. -- luke 8:34
.
The people went out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened. -- luke 8:35
.
Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well. -- luke 8:36
.
And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, for they were gripped with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned. -- luke 8:37
.
But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but He sent him away, saying, -- luke 8:38
.
"Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you." So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him. -- luke 8:39
.
And as Jesus returned, the people welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him. -- luke 8:40
.
And there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet, and began to implore Him to come to his house; -- luke 8:41
.
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him. -- luke 8:42
.
And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone, -- luke 8:43
.
came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped. -- luke 8:44
.
And Jesus said, "Who is the one who touched Me?" And while they were all denying it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing in on You." -- luke 8:45
.
But Jesus said, "Someone did touch Me, for I was aware that power had gone out of Me." -- luke 8:46
.
When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed. -- luke 8:47
.
And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace." -- luke 8:48
.
While He was still speaking, someone *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore." -- luke 8:49
.
But when Jesus heard this, He answered him, "Do not be afraid any longer; only believe, and she will be made well." -- luke 8:50
.
When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl's father and mother. -- luke 8:51
.
Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, "Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep." -- luke 8:52
.
And they began laughing at Him, knowing that she had died. -- luke 8:53
.
He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, "Child, arise!" -- luke 8:54
.
And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He gave orders for something to be given her to eat. -- luke 8:55
.
Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened. -- luke 8:56
.
And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. -- luke 9:1
.
And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing. -- luke 9:2
.
And He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not even have two tunics apiece. -- luke 9:3
.
"Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city. -- luke 9:4
.
"And as for those who do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them." -- luke 9:5
.
Departing, they began going throughout the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere. -- luke 9:6
.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, -- luke 9:7
.
and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again. -- luke 9:8
.
Herod said, "I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see Him. -- luke 9:9
.
When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. Taking them with Him, He withdrew by Himself to a city called Bethsaida. -- luke 9:10
.
But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him; and welcoming them, He began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing. -- luke 9:11
.
Now the day was ending, and the twelve came and said to Him, "Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; for here we are in a desolate place." -- luke 9:12
.
But He said to them, "You give them something to eat!" And they said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people." -- luke 9:13
.
(For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, "Have them sit down to eat in groups of about fifty each." -- luke 9:14
.
They did so, and had them all sit down. -- luke 9:15
.
Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them, and broke them, and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the people. -- luke 9:16
.
And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets full. -- luke 9:17
.
And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, "Who do the people say that I am?" -- luke 9:18
.
They answered and said, "John the Baptist, and others say Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again." -- luke 9:19
.
And He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God." -- luke 9:20
.
But He warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone, -- luke 9:21
.
saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised up on the third day." -- luke 9:22
.
And He was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me. -- luke 9:23
.
"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it. -- luke 9:24
.
"For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself? -- luke 9:25
.
"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. -- luke 9:26
.
"But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God." -- luke 9:27
.
Some eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. -- luke 9:28
.
And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming. -- luke 9:29
.
And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah, -- luke 9:30
.
who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. -- luke 9:31
.
Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him. -- luke 9:32
.
And as these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah"--not realizing what he was saying. -- luke 9:33
.
While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. -- luke 9:34
.
Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!" -- luke 9:35
.
And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen. -- luke 9:36
.
On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him. -- luke 9:37
.
And a man from the crowd shouted, saying, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only boy, -- luke 9:38
.
and a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth; and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him as it leaves. -- luke 9:39
.
"I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not." -- luke 9:40
.
And Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here." -- luke 9:41
.
While he was still approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father. -- luke 9:42
.
And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples, -- luke 9:43
.
"Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men." -- luke 9:44
.
But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement. -- luke 9:45
.
An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest. -- luke 9:46
.
But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side, -- luke 9:47
.
and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you, this is the one who is great." -- luke 9:48
.
John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us." -- luke 9:49
.
But Jesus said to him, "Do not hinder him; for he who is not against you is for you." -- luke 9:50
.
When the days were approaching for His ascension, He was determined to go to Jerusalem; -- luke 9:51
.
and He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him. -- luke 9:52
.
But they did not receive Him, because He was traveling toward Jerusalem. -- luke 9:53
.
When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" -- luke 9:54
.
But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, "You do not know what kind of spirit you are of; -- luke 9:55
.
for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."] And they went on to another village. -- luke 9:56
.
As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, "I will follow You wherever You go." -- luke 9:57
.
And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head." -- luke 9:58
.
And He said to another, "Follow Me." But he said, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father." -- luke 9:59
.
But He said to him, "Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God." -- luke 9:60
.
Another also said, "I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those at home." -- luke 9:61
.
But Jesus said to him, "No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." -- luke 9:62
.
Now after this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come. -- luke 10:1
.
And He was saying to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest. -- luke 10:2
.
"Go; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. -- luke 10:3
.
"Carry no money belt, no bag, no shoes; and greet no one on the way. -- luke 10:4
.
"Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.' -- luke 10:5
.
"If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. -- luke 10:6
.
"Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house. -- luke 10:7
.
"Whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you; -- luke 10:8
.
and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' -- luke 10:9
.
"But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say, -- luke 10:10
.
'Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near.' -- luke 10:11
.
"I say to you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city. -- luke 10:12
.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. -- luke 10:13
.
"But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. -- luke 10:14
.
"And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades! -- luke 10:15
.
"The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me." -- luke 10:16
.
The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name." -- luke 10:17
.
And He said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning. -- luke 10:18
.
"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you. -- luke 10:19
.
"Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven." -- luke 10:20
.
At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight. -- luke 10:21
.
"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him." -- luke 10:22
.
Turning to the disciples, He said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see, -- luke 10:23
.
for I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them." -- luke 10:24
.
And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" -- luke 10:25
.
And He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?" -- luke 10:26
.
And he answered, "YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF." -- luke 10:27
.
And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE." -- luke 10:28
.
But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" -- luke 10:29
.
Jesus replied and said, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead. -- luke 10:30
.
"And by chance a priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. -- luke 10:31
.
"Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. -- luke 10:32
.
"But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion, -- luke 10:33
.
and came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn and took care of him. -- luke 10:34
.
"On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return I will repay you.' -- luke 10:35
.
"Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers' hands?" -- luke 10:36
.
And he said, "The one who showed mercy toward him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same." -- luke 10:37
.
Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. -- luke 10:38
.
She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord's feet, listening to His word. -- luke 10:39
.
But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, "Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me." -- luke 10:40
.
But the Lord answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things; -- luke 10:41
.
but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her." -- luke 10:42
.
It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples." -- luke 11:1
.
And He said to them, "When you pray, say: 'Father, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. -- luke 11:2
.
'Give us each day our daily bread. -- luke 11:3
.
'And forgive us our sins, For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.'" -- luke 11:4
.
Then He said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves; -- luke 11:5
.
for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him'; -- luke 11:6
.
and from inside he answers and says, 'Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.' -- luke 11:7
.
"I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs. -- luke 11:8
.
"So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. -- luke 11:9
.
"For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened. -- luke 11:10
.
"Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? -- luke 11:11
.
"Or if he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he? -- luke 11:12
.
"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?" -- luke 11:13
.
And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed. -- luke 11:14
.
But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons." -- luke 11:15
.
Others, to test Him, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven. -- luke 11:16
.
But He knew their thoughts and said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house divided against itself falls. -- luke 11:17
.
"If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. -- luke 11:18
.
"And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? So they will be your judges. -- luke 11:19
.
"But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. -- luke 11:20
.
"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are undisturbed. -- luke 11:21
.
"But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder. -- luke 11:22
.
"He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters. -- luke 11:23
.
"When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' -- luke 11:24
.
"And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order. -- luke 11:25
.
"Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first." -- luke 11:26
.
While Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed." -- luke 11:27
.
But He said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it." -- luke 11:28
.
As the crowds were increasing, He began to say, "This generation is a wicked generation; it seeks for a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah. -- luke 11:29
.
"For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. -- luke 11:30
.
"The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. -- luke 11:31
.
"The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. -- luke 11:32
.
"No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light. -- luke 11:33
.
"The eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness. -- luke 11:34
.
"Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness. -- luke 11:35
.
"If therefore your whole body is full of light, with no dark part in it, it will be wholly illumined, as when the lamp illumines you with its rays." -- luke 11:36
.
Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee *asked Him to have lunch with him; and He went in, and reclined at the table. -- luke 11:37
.
When the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal. -- luke 11:38
.
But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but inside of you, you are full of robbery and wickedness. -- luke 11:39
.
"You foolish ones, did not He who made the outside make the inside also? -- luke 11:40
.
"But give that which is within as charity, and then all things are clean for you. -- luke 11:41
.
"But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithe of mint and rue and every kind of garden herb, and yet disregard justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others. -- luke 11:42
.
"Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the market places. -- luke 11:43
.
"Woe to you! For you are like concealed tombs, and the people who walk over them are unaware of it." -- luke 11:44
.
One of the lawyers *said to Him in reply, "Teacher, when You say this, You insult us too." -- luke 11:45
.
But He said, "Woe to you lawyers as well! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear, while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers. -- luke 11:46
.
"Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and it was your fathers who killed them. -- luke 11:47
.
"So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers; because it was they who killed them, and you build their tombs. -- luke 11:48
.
"For this reason also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute, -- luke 11:49
.
so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation, -- luke 11:50
.
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation.' -- luke 11:51
.
"Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering." -- luke 11:52
.
When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects, -- luke 11:53
.
plotting against Him to catch Him in something He might say. -- luke 11:54
.
Under these circumstances, after so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, He began saying to His disciples first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. -- luke 12:1
.
"But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known. -- luke 12:2
.
"Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops. -- luke 12:3
.
"I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do. -- luke 12:4
.
"But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him! -- luke 12:5
.
"Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God. -- luke 12:6
.
"Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows. -- luke 12:7
.
"And I say to you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels of God; -- luke 12:8
.
but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God. -- luke 12:9
.
"And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him. -- luke 12:10
.
"When they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense, or what you are to say; -- luke 12:11
.
for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say." -- luke 12:12
.
Someone in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me." -- luke 12:13
.
But He said to him, "Man, who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you?" -- luke 12:14
.
Then He said to them, "Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions." -- luke 12:15
.
And He told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man was very productive. -- luke 12:16
.
"And he began reasoning to himself, saying, 'What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?' -- luke 12:17
.
"Then he said, 'This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. -- luke 12:18
.
'And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry."' -- luke 12:19
.
"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?' -- luke 12:20
.
"So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God." -- luke 12:21
.
And He said to His disciples, "For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. -- luke 12:22
.
"For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. -- luke 12:23
.
"Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds! -- luke 12:24
.
"And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life's span? -- luke 12:25
.
"If then you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters? -- luke 12:26
.
"Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. -- luke 12:27
.
"But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? You men of little faith! -- luke 12:28
.
"And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying. -- luke 12:29
.
"For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things. -- luke 12:30
.
"But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you. -- luke 12:31
.
"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom. -- luke 12:32
.
"Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys. -- luke 12:33
.
"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. -- luke 12:34
.
"Be dressed in readiness, and keep your lamps lit. -- luke 12:35
.
"Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks. -- luke 12:36
.
"Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will gird himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and will come up and wait on them. -- luke 12:37
.
"Whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves. -- luke 12:38
.
"But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into. -- luke 12:39
.
"You too, be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect." -- luke 12:40
.
Peter said, "Lord, are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone else as well?" -- luke 12:41
.
And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and sensible steward, whom his master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their rations at the proper time? -- luke 12:42
.
"Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes. -- luke 12:43
.
"Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. -- luke 12:44
.
"But if that slave says in his heart, 'My master will be a long time in coming,' and begins to beat the slaves, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk; -- luke 12:45
.
the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and assign him a place with the unbelievers. -- luke 12:46
.
"And that slave who knew his master's will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, will receive many lashes, -- luke 12:47
.
but the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more. -- luke 12:48
.
"I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled! -- luke 12:49
.
"But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished! -- luke 12:50
.
"Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division; -- luke 12:51
.
for from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three. -- luke 12:52
.
"They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law." -- luke 12:53
.
And He was also saying to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it turns out. -- luke 12:54
.
"And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, 'It will be a hot day,' and it turns out that way. -- luke 12:55
.
"You hypocrites! You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not analyze this present time? -- luke 12:56
.
"And why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right? -- luke 12:57
.
"For while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate, on your way there make an effort to settle with him, so that he may not drag you before the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. -- luke 12:58
.
"I say to you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the very last cent." -- luke 12:59
.
Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. -- luke 13:1
.
And Jesus said to them, "Do you suppose that these Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered this fate? -- luke 13:2
.
"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. -- luke 13:3
.
"Or do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were worse culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem? -- luke 13:4
.
"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish." -- luke 13:5
.
And He began telling this parable: "A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any. -- luke 13:6
.
"And he said to the vineyard-keeper, 'Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?' -- luke 13:7
.
"And he answered and said to him, 'Let it alone, sir, for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer; -- luke 13:8
.
and if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, cut it down.'" -- luke 13:9
.
And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. -- luke 13:10
.
And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all. -- luke 13:11
.
When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your sickness." -- luke 13:12
.
And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God. -- luke 13:13
.
But the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, began saying to the crowd in response, "There are six days in which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day." -- luke 13:14
.
But the Lord answered him and said, "You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him? -- luke 13:15
.
"And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?" -- luke 13:16
.
As He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him. -- luke 13:17
.
So He was saying, "What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it? -- luke 13:18
.
"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES." -- luke 13:19
.
And again He said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? -- luke 13:20
.
"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened." -- luke 13:21
.
And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem. -- luke 13:22
.
And someone said to Him, "Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?" And He said to them, -- luke 13:23
.
"Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. -- luke 13:24
.
"Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, 'Lord, open up to us!' then He will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.' -- luke 13:25
.
"Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets'; -- luke 13:26
.
and He will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you are from; DEPART FROM ME, ALL YOU EVILDOERS.' -- luke 13:27
.
"In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrown out. -- luke 13:28
.
"And they will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God. -- luke 13:29
.
"And behold, some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last." -- luke 13:30
.
Just at that time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him, "Go away, leave here, for Herod wants to kill You." -- luke 13:31
.
And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I reach My goal.' -- luke 13:32
.
"Nevertheless I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next day; for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem. -- luke 13:33
.
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it! -- luke 13:34
.
"Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!'" -- luke 13:35
.
It happened that when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him closely. -- luke 14:1
.
And there in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy. -- luke 14:2
.
And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?" -- luke 14:3
.
But they kept silent. And He took hold of him and healed him, and sent him away. -- luke 14:4
.
And He said to them, "Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well, and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?" -- luke 14:5
.
And they could make no reply to this. -- luke 14:6
.
And He began speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been picking out the places of honor at the table, saying to them, -- luke 14:7
.
"When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him, -- luke 14:8
.
and he who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give your place to this man,' and then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place. -- luke 14:9
.
"But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher'; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you. -- luke 14:10
.
"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." -- luke 14:11
.
And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment. -- luke 14:12
.
"But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, -- luke 14:13
.
and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous." -- luke 14:14
.
When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, "Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!" -- luke 14:15
.
But He said to him, "A man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many; -- luke 14:16
.
and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, 'Come; for everything is ready now.' -- luke 14:17
.
"But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, 'I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it; please consider me excused.' -- luke 14:18
.
"Another one said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.' -- luke 14:19
.
"Another one said, 'I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.' -- luke 14:20
.
"And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, 'Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.' -- luke 14:21
.
"And the slave said, 'Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.' -- luke 14:22
.
"And the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the highways and along the hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled. -- luke 14:23
.
'For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.'" -- luke 14:24
.
Now large crowds were going along with Him; and He turned and said to them, -- luke 14:25
.
"If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple. -- luke 14:26
.
"Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple. -- luke 14:27
.
"For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it? -- luke 14:28
.
"Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who observe it begin to ridicule him, -- luke 14:29
.
saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.' -- luke 14:30
.
"Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand? -- luke 14:31
.
"Or else, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. -- luke 14:32
.
"So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions. -- luke 14:33
.
"Therefore, salt is good; but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned? -- luke 14:34
.
"It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear." -- luke 14:35
.
Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him. -- luke 15:1
.
Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them." -- luke 15:2
.
So He told them this parable, saying, -- luke 15:3
.
"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? -- luke 15:4
.
"When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. -- luke 15:5
.
"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' -- luke 15:6
.
"I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. -- luke 15:7
.
"Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? -- luke 15:8
.
"When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost!' -- luke 15:9
.
"In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents." -- luke 15:10
.
And He said, "A man had two sons. -- luke 15:11
.
"The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.' So he divided his wealth between them. -- luke 15:12
.
"And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living. -- luke 15:13
.
"Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished. -- luke 15:14
.
"So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. -- luke 15:15
.
"And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him. -- luke 15:16
.
"But when he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger! -- luke 15:17
.
'I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight; -- luke 15:18
.
I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men."' -- luke 15:19
.
"So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. -- luke 15:20
.
"And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' -- luke 15:21
.
"But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet; -- luke 15:22
.
and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and celebrate; -- luke 15:23
.
for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.' And they began to celebrate. -- luke 15:24
.
"Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. -- luke 15:25
.
"And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be. -- luke 15:26
.
"And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.' -- luke 15:27
.
"But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him. -- luke 15:28
.
"But he answered and said to his father, 'Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends; -- luke 15:29
.
but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.' -- luke 15:30
.
"And he said to him, 'Son, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours. -- luke 15:31
.
'But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found.'" -- luke 15:32
.
Now He was also saying to the disciples, "There was a rich man who had a manager, and this manager was reported to him as squandering his possessions. -- luke 16:1
.
"And he called him and said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.' -- luke 16:2
.
"The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. -- luke 16:3
.
'I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from the management people will welcome me into their homes.' -- luke 16:4
.
"And he summoned each one of his master's debtors, and he began saying to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' -- luke 16:5
.
"And he said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.' -- luke 16:6
.
"Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' And he said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He *said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.' -- luke 16:7
.
"And his master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light. -- luke 16:8
.
"And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings. -- luke 16:9
.
"He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much. -- luke 16:10
.
"Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you? -- luke 16:11
.
"And if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? -- luke 16:12
.
"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth." -- luke 16:13
.
Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were scoffing at Him. -- luke 16:14
.
And He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God. -- luke 16:15
.
"The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. -- luke 16:16
.
"But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail. -- luke 16:17
.
"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery. -- luke 16:18
.
"Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day. -- luke 16:19
.
"And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, -- luke 16:20
.
and longing to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table; besides, even the dogs were coming and licking his sores. -- luke 16:21
.
"Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried. -- luke 16:22
.
"In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom. -- luke 16:23
.
"And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.' -- luke 16:24
.
"But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony. -- luke 16:25
.
'And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us.' -- luke 16:26
.
"And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father's house-- -- luke 16:27
.
for I have five brothers--in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' -- luke 16:28
.
"But Abraham *said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.' -- luke 16:29
.
"But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!' -- luke 16:30
.
"But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.'" -- luke 16:31
.
He said to His disciples, "It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come, but woe to him through whom they come! -- luke 17:1
.
"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he would cause one of these little ones to stumble. -- luke 17:2
.
"Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. -- luke 17:3
.
"And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' forgive him." -- luke 17:4
.
The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!" -- luke 17:5
.
And the Lord said, "If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea'; and it would obey you. -- luke 17:6
.
"Which of you, having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down to eat'? -- luke 17:7
.
"But will he not say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, and properly clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink'? -- luke 17:8
.
"He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded, does he? -- luke 17:9
.
"So you too, when you do all the things which are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.'" -- luke 17:10
.
While He was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee. -- luke 17:11
.
As He entered a village, ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him; -- luke 17:12
.
and they raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!" -- luke 17:13
.
When He saw them, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they were going, they were cleansed. -- luke 17:14
.
Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice, -- luke 17:15
.
and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan. -- luke 17:16
.
Then Jesus answered and said, "Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine--where are they? -- luke 17:17
.
"Was no one found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?" -- luke 17:18
.
And He said to him, "Stand up and go; your faith has made you well." -- luke 17:19
.
Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; -- luke 17:20
.
nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or, 'There it is!' For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst." -- luke 17:21
.
And He said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. -- luke 17:22
.
"They will say to you, 'Look there! Look here!' Do not go away, and do not run after them. -- luke 17:23
.
"For just like the lightning, when it flashes out of one part of the sky, shines to the other part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in His day. -- luke 17:24
.
"But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. -- luke 17:25
.
"And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man: -- luke 17:26
.
they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. -- luke 17:27
.
"It was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building; -- luke 17:28
.
but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. -- luke 17:29
.
"It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed. -- luke 17:30
.
"On that day, the one who is on the housetop and whose goods are in the house must not go down to take them out; and likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back. -- luke 17:31
.
"Remember Lot's wife. -- luke 17:32
.
"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it. -- luke 17:33
.
"I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left. -- luke 17:34
.
"There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left. -- luke 17:35
.
["Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left."] -- luke 17:36
.
And answering they *said to Him, "Where, Lord?" And He said to them, "Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered." -- luke 17:37
.
Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart, -- luke 18:1
.
saying, "In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect man. -- luke 18:2
.
"There was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, 'Give me legal protection from my opponent.' -- luke 18:3
.
"For a while he was unwilling; but afterward he said to himself, 'Even though I do not fear God nor respect man, -- luke 18:4
.
yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out.'" -- luke 18:5
.
And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge *said; -- luke 18:6
.
now, will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them? -- luke 18:7
.
"I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?" -- luke 18:8
.
And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt: -- luke 18:9
.
"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. -- luke 18:10
.
"The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: 'God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. -- luke 18:11
.
'I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.' -- luke 18:12
.
"But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, the sinner!' -- luke 18:13
.
"I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted." -- luke 18:14
.
And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they began rebuking them. -- luke 18:15
.
But Jesus called for them, saying, "Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. -- luke 18:16
.
"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all." -- luke 18:17
.
A ruler questioned Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" -- luke 18:18
.
And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone. -- luke 18:19
.
"You know the commandments, 'DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.'" -- luke 18:20
.
And he said, "All these things I have kept from my youth." -- luke 18:21
.
When Jesus heard this, He said to him, "One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me." -- luke 18:22
.
But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. -- luke 18:23
.
And Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God! -- luke 18:24
.
"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." -- luke 18:25
.
They who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?" -- luke 18:26
.
But He said, "The things that are impossible with people are possible with God." -- luke 18:27
.
Peter said, "Behold, we have left our own homes and followed You." -- luke 18:28
.
And He said to them, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, -- luke 18:29
.
who will not receive many times as much at this time and in the age to come, eternal life." -- luke 18:30
.
Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished. -- luke 18:31
.
"For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon, -- luke 18:32
.
and after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and the third day He will rise again." -- luke 18:33
.
But the disciples understood none of these things, and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said. -- luke 18:34
.
As Jesus was approaching Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging. -- luke 18:35
.
Now hearing a crowd going by, he began to inquire what this was. -- luke 18:36
.
They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. -- luke 18:37
.
And he called out, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" -- luke 18:38
.
Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" -- luke 18:39
.
And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he came near, He questioned him, -- luke 18:40
.
"What do you want Me to do for you?" And he said, "Lord, I want to regain my sight!" -- luke 18:41
.
And Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has made you well." -- luke 18:42
.
Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him, glorifying God; and when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God. -- luke 18:43
.
He entered Jericho and was passing through. -- luke 19:1
.
And there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich. -- luke 19:2
.
Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature. -- luke 19:3
.
So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way. -- luke 19:4
.
When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house." -- luke 19:5
.
And he hurried and came down and received Him gladly. -- luke 19:6
.
When they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner." -- luke 19:7
.
Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much." -- luke 19:8
.
And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham. -- luke 19:9
.
"For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost." -- luke 19:10
.
While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately. -- luke 19:11
.
So He said, "A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return. -- luke 19:12
.
"And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, 'Do business with this until I come back.' -- luke 19:13
.
"But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.' -- luke 19:14
.
"When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done. -- luke 19:15
.
"The first appeared, saying, 'Master, your mina has made ten minas more.' -- luke 19:16
.
"And he said to him, 'Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.' -- luke 19:17
.
"The second came, saying, 'Your mina, master, has made five minas.' -- luke 19:18
.
"And he said to him also, 'And you are to be over five cities.' -- luke 19:19
.
"Another came, saying, 'Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief; -- luke 19:20
.
for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.' -- luke 19:21
.
"He *said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? -- luke 19:22
.
'Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?' -- luke 19:23
.
"Then he said to the bystanders, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.' -- luke 19:24
.
"And they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas already.' -- luke 19:25
.
"I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. -- luke 19:26
.
"But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence." -- luke 19:27
.
After He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. -- luke 19:28
.
When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples, -- luke 19:29
.
saying, "Go into the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here. -- luke 19:30
.
"If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say, 'The Lord has need of it.'" -- luke 19:31
.
So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them. -- luke 19:32
.
As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?" -- luke 19:33
.
They said, "The Lord has need of it." -- luke 19:34
.
They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it. -- luke 19:35
.
As He was going, they were spreading their coats on the road. -- luke 19:36
.
As soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen, -- luke 19:37
.
shouting: "BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!" -- luke 19:38
.
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples." -- luke 19:39
.
But Jesus answered, "I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out!" -- luke 19:40
.
When He approached Jerusalem, He saw the city and wept over it, -- luke 19:41
.
saying, "If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes. -- luke 19:42
.
"For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side, -- luke 19:43
.
and they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation." -- luke 19:44
.
Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling, -- luke 19:45
.
saying to them, "It is written, 'AND MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,' but you have made it a ROBBERS' DEN." -- luke 19:46
.
And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him, -- luke 19:47
.
and they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging on to every word He said. -- luke 19:48
.
On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted Him, -- luke 20:1
.
and they spoke, saying to Him, "Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?" -- luke 20:2
.
Jesus answered and said to them, "I will also ask you a question, and you tell Me: -- luke 20:3
.
"Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?" -- luke 20:4
.
They reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why did you not believe him?' -- luke 20:5
.
"But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet." -- luke 20:6
.
So they answered that they did not know where it came from. -- luke 20:7
.
And Jesus said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things." -- luke 20:8
.
And He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time. -- luke 20:9
.
"At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, so that they would give him some of the produce of the vineyard; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed. -- luke 20:10
.
"And he proceeded to send another slave; and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed. -- luke 20:11
.
"And he proceeded to send a third; and this one also they wounded and cast out. -- luke 20:12
.
"The owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.' -- luke 20:13
.
"But when the vine-growers saw him, they reasoned with one another, saying, 'This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.' -- luke 20:14
.
"So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them? -- luke 20:15
.
"He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard it, they said, "May it never be!" -- luke 20:16
.
But Jesus looked at them and said, "What then is this that is written: 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone'? -- luke 20:17
.
"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust." -- luke 20:18
.
The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, and they feared the people; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them. -- luke 20:19
.
So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order that they might catch Him in some statement, so that they could deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor. -- luke 20:20
.
They questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. -- luke 20:21
.
"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?" -- luke 20:22
.
But He detected their trickery and said to them, -- luke 20:23
.
"Show Me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?" They said, "Caesar's." -- luke 20:24
.
And He said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." -- luke 20:25
.
And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people; and being amazed at His answer, they became silent. -- luke 20:26
.
Now there came to Him some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection), -- luke 20:27
.
and they questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN'S BROTHER DIES, having a wife, AND HE IS CHILDLESS, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER. -- luke 20:28
.
"Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless; -- luke 20:29
.
and the second -- luke 20:30
.
and the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children. -- luke 20:31
.
"Finally the woman died also. -- luke 20:32
.
"In the resurrection therefore, which one's wife will she be? For all seven had married her." -- luke 20:33
.
Jesus said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, -- luke 20:34
.
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; -- luke 20:35
.
for they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. -- luke 20:36
.
"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the burning bush, where he calls the Lord THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB. -- luke 20:37
.
"Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live to Him." -- luke 20:38
.
Some of the scribes answered and said, "Teacher, You have spoken well." -- luke 20:39
.
For they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything. -- luke 20:40
.
Then He said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is David's son? -- luke 20:41
.
"For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, -- luke 20:42
.
UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET."' -- luke 20:43
.
"Therefore David calls Him 'Lord,' and how is He his son?" -- luke 20:44
.
And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples, -- luke 20:45
.
"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love respectful greetings in the market places, and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets, -- luke 20:46
.
who devour widows' houses, and for appearance's sake offer long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation." -- luke 20:47
.
And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury. -- luke 21:1
.
And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins. -- luke 21:2
.
And He said, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them; -- luke 21:3
.
for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on." -- luke 21:4
.
And while some were talking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts, He said, -- luke 21:5
.
"As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down." -- luke 21:6
.
They questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, when therefore will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?" -- luke 21:7
.
And He said, "See to it that you are not misled; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not go after them. -- luke 21:8
.
"When you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end does not follow immediately." -- luke 21:9
.
Then He continued by saying to them, "Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, -- luke 21:10
.
and there will be great earthquakes, and in various places plagues and famines; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. -- luke 21:11
.
"But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name's sake. -- luke 21:12
.
"It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony. -- luke 21:13
.
"So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves; -- luke 21:14
.
for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute. -- luke 21:15
.
"But you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death, -- luke 21:16
.
and you will be hated by all because of My name. -- luke 21:17
.
"Yet not a hair of your head will perish. -- luke 21:18
.
"By your endurance you will gain your lives. -- luke 21:19
.
"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near. -- luke 21:20
.
"Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city; -- luke 21:21
.
because these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written will be fulfilled. -- luke 21:22
.
"Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people; -- luke 21:23
.
and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. -- luke 21:24
.
"There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves, -- luke 21:25
.
men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. -- luke 21:26
.
"Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD with power and great glory. -- luke 21:27
.
"But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near." -- luke 21:28
.
Then He told them a parable: "Behold the fig tree and all the trees; -- luke 21:29
.
as soon as they put forth leaves, you see it and know for yourselves that summer is now near. -- luke 21:30
.
"So you also, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near. -- luke 21:31
.
"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place. -- luke 21:32
.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. -- luke 21:33
.
"Be on guard, so that your hearts will not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap; -- luke 21:34
.
for it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth. -- luke 21:35
.
"But keep on the alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man." -- luke 21:36
.
Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet. -- luke 21:37
.
And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to Him in the temple to listen to Him. -- luke 21:38
.
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. -- luke 22:1
.
The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people. -- luke 22:2
.
And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve. -- luke 22:3
.
And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them. -- luke 22:4
.
They were glad and agreed to give him money. -- luke 22:5
.
So he consented, and began seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them apart from the crowd. -- luke 22:6
.
Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. -- luke 22:7
.
And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it." -- luke 22:8
.
They said to Him, "Where do You want us to prepare it?" -- luke 22:9
.
And He said to them, "When you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters. -- luke 22:10
.
"And you shall say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"' -- luke 22:11
.
"And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; prepare it there." -- luke 22:12
.
And they left and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover. -- luke 22:13
.
When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him. -- luke 22:14
.
And He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; -- luke 22:15
.
for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." -- luke 22:16
.
And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves; -- luke 22:17
.
for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes." -- luke 22:18
.
And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me." -- luke 22:19
.
And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood. -- luke 22:20
.
"But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table. -- luke 22:21
.
"For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!" -- luke 22:22
.
And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing. -- luke 22:23
.
And there arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest. -- luke 22:24
.
And He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who have authority over them are called 'Benefactors.' -- luke 22:25
.
"But it is not this way with you, but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant. -- luke 22:26
.
"For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves. -- luke 22:27
.
"You are those who have stood by Me in My trials; -- luke 22:28
.
and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you -- luke 22:29
.
that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. -- luke 22:30
.
"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat; -- luke 22:31
.
but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers." -- luke 22:32
.
But he said to Him, "Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!" -- luke 22:33
.
And He said, "I say to you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me." -- luke 22:34
.
And He said to them, "When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?" They said, "No, nothing." -- luke 22:35
.
And He said to them, "But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one. -- luke 22:36
.
"For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, 'AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH TRANSGRESSORS'; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment." -- luke 22:37
.
They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough." -- luke 22:38
.
And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him. -- luke 22:39
.
When He arrived at the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation." -- luke 22:40
.
And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and began to pray, -- luke 22:41
.
saying, "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done." -- luke 22:42
.
Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him. -- luke 22:43
.
And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground. -- luke 22:44
.
When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow, -- luke 22:45
.
and said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not enter into temptation." -- luke 22:46
.
While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was preceding them; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him. -- luke 22:47
.
But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" -- luke 22:48
.
When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?" -- luke 22:49
.
And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. -- luke 22:50
.
But Jesus answered and said, "Stop! No more of this." And He touched his ear and healed him. -- luke 22:51
.
Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber? -- luke 22:52
.
"While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours." -- luke 22:53
.
Having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him to the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance. -- luke 22:54
.
After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them. -- luke 22:55
.
And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, "This man was with Him too." -- luke 22:56
.
But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him." -- luke 22:57
.
A little later, another saw him and said, "You are one of them too!" But Peter said, "Man, I am not!" -- luke 22:58
.
After about an hour had passed, another man began to insist, saying, "Certainly this man also was with Him, for he is a Galilean too." -- luke 22:59
.
But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. -- luke 22:60
.
The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, "Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times." -- luke 22:61
.
And he went out and wept bitterly. -- luke 22:62
.
Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him and beating Him, -- luke 22:63
.
and they blindfolded Him and were asking Him, saying, "Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?" -- luke 22:64
.
And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming. -- luke 22:65
.
When it was day, the Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away to their council chamber, saying, -- luke 22:66
.
"If You are the Christ, tell us." But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe; -- luke 22:67
.
and if I ask a question, you will not answer. -- luke 22:68
.
"But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD." -- luke 22:69
.
And they all said, "Are You the Son of God, then?" And He said to them, "Yes, I am." -- luke 22:70
.
Then they said, "What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth." -- luke 22:71
.
Then the whole body of them got up and brought Him before Pilate. -- luke 23:1
.
And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King." -- luke 23:2
.
So Pilate asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He answered him and said, "It is as you say." -- luke 23:3
.
Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this man." -- luke 23:4
.
But they kept on insisting, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as this place." -- luke 23:5
.
When Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. -- luke 23:6
.
And when he learned that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was in Jerusalem at that time. -- luke 23:7
.
Now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him. -- luke 23:8
.
And he questioned Him at some length; but He answered him nothing. -- luke 23:9
.
And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, accusing Him vehemently. -- luke 23:10
.
And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate. -- luke 23:11
.
Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for before they had been enemies with each other. -- luke 23:12
.
Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people, -- luke 23:13
.
and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion, and behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no guilt in this man regarding the charges which you make against Him. -- luke 23:14
.
"No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him. -- luke 23:15
.
"Therefore I will punish Him and release Him." -- luke 23:16
.
[Now he was obliged to release to them at the feast one prisoner.] -- luke 23:17
.
But they cried out all together, saying, "Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!" -- luke 23:18
.
(He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder.) -- luke 23:19
.
Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again, -- luke 23:20
.
but they kept on calling out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!" -- luke 23:21
.
And he said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has this man done? I have found in Him no guilt demanding death; therefore I will punish Him and release Him." -- luke 23:22
.
But they were insistent, with loud voices asking that He be crucified. And their voices began to prevail. -- luke 23:23
.
And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted. -- luke 23:24
.
And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he delivered Jesus to their will. -- luke 23:25
.
When they led Him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus. -- luke 23:26
.
And following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him. -- luke 23:27
.
But Jesus turning to them said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. -- luke 23:28
.
"For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.' -- luke 23:29
.
"Then they will begin TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS, 'FALL ON US,' AND TO THE HILLS, 'COVER US.' -- luke 23:30
.
"For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?" -- luke 23:31
.
Two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be put to death with Him. -- luke 23:32
.
When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. -- luke 23:33
.
But Jesus was saying, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots, dividing up His garments among themselves. -- luke 23:34
.
And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One." -- luke 23:35
.
The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine, -- luke 23:36
.
and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!" -- luke 23:37
.
Now there was also an inscription above Him, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS." -- luke 23:38
.
One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, "Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!" -- luke 23:39
.
But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? -- luke 23:40
.
"And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong." -- luke 23:41
.
And he was saying, "Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!" -- luke 23:42
.
And He said to him, "Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise." -- luke 23:43
.
It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour, -- luke 23:44
.
because the sun was obscured; and the veil of the temple was torn in two. -- luke 23:45
.
And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT." Having said this, He breathed His last. -- luke 23:46
.
Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began praising God, saying, "Certainly this man was innocent." -- luke 23:47
.
And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened, began to return, beating their breasts. -- luke 23:48
.
And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, seeing these things. -- luke 23:49
.
And a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man -- luke 23:50
.
(he had not consented to their plan and action), a man from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God; -- luke 23:51
.
this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. -- luke 23:52
.
And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain. -- luke 23:53
.
It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. -- luke 23:54
.
Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. -- luke 23:55
.
Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. -- luke 23:56
.
But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared. -- luke 24:1
.
And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, -- luke 24:2
.
but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. -- luke 24:3
.
While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing; -- luke 24:4
.
and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living One among the dead? -- luke 24:5
.
"He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee, -- luke 24:6
.
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again." -- luke 24:7
.
And they remembered His words, -- luke 24:8
.
and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. -- luke 24:9
.
Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles. -- luke 24:10
.
But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them. -- luke 24:11
.
But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened. -- luke 24:12
.
And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem. -- luke 24:13
.
And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place. -- luke 24:14
.
While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them. -- luke 24:15
.
But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him. -- luke 24:16
.
And He said to them, "What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?" And they stood still, looking sad. -- luke 24:17
.
One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, "Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?" -- luke 24:18
.
And He said to them, "What things?" And they said to Him, "The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people, -- luke 24:19
.
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him. -- luke 24:20
.
"But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened. -- luke 24:21
.
"But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning, -- luke 24:22
.
and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive. -- luke 24:23
.
"Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see." -- luke 24:24
.
And He said to them, "O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! -- luke 24:25
.
"Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?" -- luke 24:26
.
Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures. -- luke 24:27
.
And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther. -- luke 24:28
.
But they urged Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over." So He went in to stay with them. -- luke 24:29
.
When He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and breaking it, He began giving it to them. -- luke 24:30
.
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight. -- luke 24:31
.
They said to one another, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?" -- luke 24:32
.
And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them, -- luke 24:33
.
saying, "The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon." -- luke 24:34
.
They began to relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread. -- luke 24:35
.
While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and *said to them, "Peace be to you." -- luke 24:36
.
But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit. -- luke 24:37
.
And He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? -- luke 24:38
.
"See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." -- luke 24:39
.
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. -- luke 24:40
.
While they still could not believe it because of their joy and amazement, He said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?" -- luke 24:41
.
They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish; -- luke 24:42
.
and He took it and ate it before them. -- luke 24:43
.
Now He said to them, "These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled." -- luke 24:44
.
Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, -- luke 24:45
.
and He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day, -- luke 24:46
.
and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. -- luke 24:47
.
"You are witnesses of these things. -- luke 24:48
.
"And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high." -- luke 24:49
.
And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them. -- luke 24:50
.
While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven. -- luke 24:51
.
And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, -- luke 24:52
.
and were continually in the temple praising God. -- luke 24:53
.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. -- john 1:1
.
He was in the beginning with God. -- john 1:2
.
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being. -- john 1:3
.
In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. -- john 1:4
.
The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. -- john 1:5
.
There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. -- john 1:6
.
He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him. -- john 1:7
.
He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light. -- john 1:8
.
There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man. -- john 1:9
.
He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. -- john 1:10
.
He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him. -- john 1:11
.
But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, -- john 1:12
.
who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. -- john 1:13
.
And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. -- john 1:14
.
John *testified about Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.'" -- john 1:15
.
For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. -- john 1:16
.
For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ. -- john 1:17
.
No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him. -- john 1:18
.
This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" -- john 1:19
.
And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." -- john 1:20
.
They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he *said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No." -- john 1:21
.
Then they said to him, "Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?" -- john 1:22
.
He said, "I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD,' as Isaiah the prophet said." -- john 1:23
.
Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. -- john 1:24
.
They asked him, and said to him, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" -- john 1:25
.
John answered them saying, "I baptize in water, but among you stands One whom you do not know. -- john 1:26
.
"It is He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie." -- john 1:27
.
These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. -- john 1:28
.
The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! -- john 1:29
.
"This is He on behalf of whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.' -- john 1:30
.
"I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water." -- john 1:31
.
John testified saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him. -- john 1:32
.
"I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.' -- john 1:33
.
"I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God." -- john 1:34
.
Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, -- john 1:35
.
and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" -- john 1:36
.
The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. -- john 1:37
.
And Jesus turned and saw them following, and *said to them, "What do you seek?" They said to Him, "Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?" -- john 1:38
.
He *said to them, "Come, and you will see." So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. -- john 1:39
.
One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. -- john 1:40
.
He *found first his own brother Simon and *said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated means Christ). -- john 1:41
.
He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (which is translated Peter). -- john 1:42
.
The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me." -- john 1:43
.
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. -- john 1:44
.
Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." -- john 1:45
.
Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip *said to him, "Come and see." -- john 1:46
.
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!" -- john 1:47
.
Nathanael *said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you." -- john 1:48
.
Nathanael answered Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel." -- john 1:49
.
Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these." -- john 1:50
.
And He *said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man." -- john 1:51
.
On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; -- john 2:1
.
and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. -- john 2:2
.
When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, "They have no wine." -- john 2:3
.
And Jesus *said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come." -- john 2:4
.
His mother *said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do it." -- john 2:5
.
Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each. -- john 2:6
.
Jesus *said to them, "Fill the waterpots with water." So they filled them up to the brim. -- john 2:7
.
And He *said to them, "Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter." So they took it to him. -- john 2:8
.
When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter *called the bridegroom, -- john 2:9
.
and *said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now." -- john 2:10
.
This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him. -- john 2:11
.
After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days. -- john 2:12
.
The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. -- john 2:13
.
And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables. -- john 2:14
.
And He made a scourge of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables; -- john 2:15
.
and to those who were selling the doves He said, "Take these things away; stop making My Father's house a place of business." -- john 2:16
.
His disciples remembered that it was written, "ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME." -- john 2:17
.
The Jews then said to Him, "What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?" -- john 2:18
.
Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." -- john 2:19
.
The Jews then said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?" -- john 2:20
.
But He was speaking of the temple of His body. -- john 2:21
.
So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken. -- john 2:22
.
Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing. -- john 2:23
.
But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men, -- john 2:24
.
and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man. -- john 2:25
.
Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; -- john 3:1
.
this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him." -- john 3:2
.
Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." -- john 3:3
.
Nicodemus *said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" -- john 3:4
.
Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. -- john 3:5
.
"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. -- john 3:6
.
"Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' -- john 3:7
.
"The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit." -- john 3:8
.
Nicodemus said to Him, "How can these things be?" -- john 3:9
.
Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things? -- john 3:10
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony. -- john 3:11
.
"If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? -- john 3:12
.
"No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man. -- john 3:13
.
"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; -- john 3:14
.
so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life. -- john 3:15
.
"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. -- john 3:16
.
"For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. -- john 3:17
.
"He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. -- john 3:18
.
"This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. -- john 3:19
.
"For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. -- john 3:20
.
"But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God." -- john 3:21
.
After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing. -- john 3:22
.
John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people were coming and were being baptized-- -- john 3:23
.
for John had not yet been thrown into prison. -- john 3:24
.
Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification. -- john 3:25
.
And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him." -- john 3:26
.
John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven. -- john 3:27
.
"You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent ahead of Him.' -- john 3:28
.
"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made full. -- john 3:29
.
"He must increase, but I must decrease. -- john 3:30
.
"He who comes from above is above all, he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. -- john 3:31
.
"What He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony. -- john 3:32
.
"He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true. -- john 3:33
.
"For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure. -- john 3:34
.
"The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand. -- john 3:35
.
"He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him." -- john 3:36
.
Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John -- john 4:1
.
(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were), -- john 4:2
.
He left Judea and went away again into Galilee. -- john 4:3
.
And He had to pass through Samaria. -- john 4:4
.
So He *came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; -- john 4:5
.
and Jacob's well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. -- john 4:6
.
There *came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus *said to her, "Give Me a drink." -- john 4:7
.
For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. -- john 4:8
.
Therefore the Samaritan woman *said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) -- john 4:9
.
Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water." -- john 4:10
.
She *said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water? -- john 4:11
.
"You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?" -- john 4:12
.
Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again; -- john 4:13
.
but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life." -- john 4:14
.
The woman *said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw." -- john 4:15
.
He *said to her, "Go, call your husband and come here." -- john 4:16
.
The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus *said to her, "You have correctly said, 'I have no husband'; -- john 4:17
.
for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly." -- john 4:18
.
The woman *said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. -- john 4:19
.
"Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship." -- john 4:20
.
Jesus *said to her, "Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. -- john 4:21
.
"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. -- john 4:22
.
"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. -- john 4:23
.
"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." -- john 4:24
.
The woman *said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us." -- john 4:25
.
Jesus *said to her, "I who speak to you am He." -- john 4:26
.
At this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, "What do You seek?" or, "Why do You speak with her?" -- john 4:27
.
So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city and *said to the men, -- john 4:28
.
"Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is it?" -- john 4:29
.
They went out of the city, and were coming to Him. -- john 4:30
.
Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat." -- john 4:31
.
But He said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about." -- john 4:32
.
So the disciples were saying to one another, "No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?" -- john 4:33
.
Jesus *said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work. -- john 4:34
.
"Do you not say, 'There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest. -- john 4:35
.
"Already he who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for life eternal; so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. -- john 4:36
.
"For in this case the saying is true, 'One sows and another reaps.' -- john 4:37
.
"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor." -- john 4:38
.
From that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, "He told me all the things that I have done." -- john 4:39
.
So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. -- john 4:40
.
Many more believed because of His word; -- john 4:41
.
and they were saying to the woman, "It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the world." -- john 4:42
.
After the two days He went forth from there into Galilee. -- john 4:43
.
For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. -- john 4:44
.
So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast. -- john 4:45
.
Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum. -- john 4:46
.
When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was imploring Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. -- john 4:47
.
So Jesus said to him, "Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe." -- john 4:48
.
The royal official *said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies." -- john 4:49
.
Jesus *said to him, "Go; your son lives." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started off. -- john 4:50
.
As he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was living. -- john 4:51
.
So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him." -- john 4:52
.
So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives"; and he himself believed and his whole household. -- john 4:53
.
This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come out of Judea into Galilee. -- john 4:54
.
After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. -- john 5:1
.
Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes. -- john 5:2
.
In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [waiting for the moving of the waters; -- john 5:3
.
for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.] -- john 5:4
.
A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. -- john 5:5
.
When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He *said to him, "Do you wish to get well?" -- john 5:6
.
The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me." -- john 5:7
.
Jesus *said to him, "Get up, pick up your pallet and walk." -- john 5:8
.
Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk. Now it was the Sabbath on that day. -- john 5:9
.
So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet." -- john 5:10
.
But he answered them, "He who made me well was the one who said to me, 'Pick up your pallet and walk.'" -- john 5:11
.
They asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Pick up your pallet and walk'?" -- john 5:12
.
But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place. -- john 5:13
.
Afterward Jesus *found him in the temple and said to him, "Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you." -- john 5:14
.
The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. -- john 5:15
.
For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. -- john 5:16
.
But He answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working." -- john 5:17
.
For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. -- john 5:18
.
Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner. -- john 5:19
.
"For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel. -- john 5:20
.
"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes. -- john 5:21
.
"For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, -- john 5:22
.
so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. -- john 5:23
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. -- john 5:24
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. -- john 5:25
.
"For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself; -- john 5:26
.
and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. -- john 5:27
.
"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, -- john 5:28
.
and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment. -- john 5:29
.
"I can do nothing on My own initiative. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. -- john 5:30
.
"If I alone testify about Myself, My testimony is not true. -- john 5:31
.
"There is another who testifies of Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true. -- john 5:32
.
"You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. -- john 5:33
.
"But the testimony which I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. -- john 5:34
.
"He was the lamp that was burning and was shining and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. -- john 5:35
.
"But the testimony which I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish--the very works that I do--testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me. -- john 5:36
.
"And the Father who sent Me, He has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form. -- john 5:37
.
"You do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent. -- john 5:38
.
"You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; -- john 5:39
.
and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life. -- john 5:40
.
"I do not receive glory from men; -- john 5:41
.
but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. -- john 5:42
.
"I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. -- john 5:43
.
"How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God? -- john 5:44
.
"Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope. -- john 5:45
.
"For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me. -- john 5:46
.
"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?" -- john 5:47
.
After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias). -- john 6:1
.
A large crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick. -- john 6:2
.
Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples. -- john 6:3
.
Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. -- john 6:4
.
Therefore Jesus, lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, *said to Philip, "Where are we to buy bread, so that these may eat?" -- john 6:5
.
This He was saying to test him, for He Himself knew what He was intending to do. -- john 6:6
.
Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for everyone to receive a little." -- john 6:7
.
One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, *said to Him, -- john 6:8
.
"There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?" -- john 6:9
.
Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. -- john 6:10
.
Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted. -- john 6:11
.
When they were filled, He *said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost." -- john 6:12
.
So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. -- john 6:13
.
Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world." -- john 6:14
.
So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone. -- john 6:15
.
Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, -- john 6:16
.
and after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. -- john 6:17
.
The sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing. -- john 6:18
.
Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they *saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened. -- john 6:19
.
But He *said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid." -- john 6:20
.
So they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going. -- john 6:21
.
The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone. -- john 6:22
.
There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. -- john 6:23
.
So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus. -- john 6:24
.
When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You get here?" -- john 6:25
.
Jesus answered them and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. -- john 6:26
.
"Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal." -- john 6:27
.
Therefore they said to Him, "What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?" -- john 6:28
.
Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent." -- john 6:29
.
So they said to Him, "What then do You do for a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work do You perform? -- john 6:30
.
"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.'" -- john 6:31
.
Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven. -- john 6:32
.
"For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world." -- john 6:33
.
Then they said to Him, "Lord, always give us this bread." -- john 6:34
.
Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst. -- john 6:35
.
"But I said to you that you have seen Me, and yet do not believe. -- john 6:36
.
"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out. -- john 6:37
.
"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. -- john 6:38
.
"This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day. -- john 6:39
.
"For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day." -- john 6:40
.
Therefore the Jews were grumbling about Him, because He said, "I am the bread that came down out of heaven." -- john 6:41
.
They were saying, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, 'I have come down out of heaven'?" -- john 6:42
.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Do not grumble among yourselves. -- john 6:43
.
"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day. -- john 6:44
.
"It is written in the prophets, 'AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me. -- john 6:45
.
"Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father. -- john 6:46
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. -- john 6:47
.
"I am the bread of life. -- john 6:48
.
"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. -- john 6:49
.
"This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. -- john 6:50
.
"I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh." -- john 6:51
.
Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?" -- john 6:52
.
So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. -- john 6:53
.
"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. -- john 6:54
.
"For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. -- john 6:55
.
"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. -- john 6:56
.
"As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. -- john 6:57
.
"This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever." -- john 6:58
.
These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum. -- john 6:59
.
Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this said, "This is a difficult statement; who can listen to it?" -- john 6:60
.
But Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble? -- john 6:61
.
"What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before? -- john 6:62
.
"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. -- john 6:63
.
"But there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him. -- john 6:64
.
And He was saying, "For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father." -- john 6:65
.
As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore. -- john 6:66
.
So Jesus said to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?" -- john 6:67
.
Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. -- john 6:68
.
"We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God." -- john 6:69
.
Jesus answered them, "Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?" -- john 6:70
.
Now He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him. -- john 6:71
.
After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him. -- john 7:1
.
Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near. -- john 7:2
.
Therefore His brothers said to Him, "Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing. -- john 7:3
.
"For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world." -- john 7:4
.
For not even His brothers were believing in Him. -- john 7:5
.
So Jesus *said to them, "My time is not yet here, but your time is always opportune. -- john 7:6
.
"The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil. -- john 7:7
.
"Go up to the feast yourselves; I do not go up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come." -- john 7:8
.
Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee. -- john 7:9
.
But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as if, in secret. -- john 7:10
.
So the Jews were seeking Him at the feast and were saying, "Where is He?" -- john 7:11
.
There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him; some were saying, "He is a good man"; others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He leads the people astray." -- john 7:12
.
Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for fear of the Jews. -- john 7:13
.
But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and began to teach. -- john 7:14
.
The Jews then were astonished, saying, "How has this man become learned, having never been educated?" -- john 7:15
.
So Jesus answered them and said, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me. -- john 7:16
.
"If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself. -- john 7:17
.
"He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him. -- john 7:18
.
"Did not Moses give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?" -- john 7:19
.
The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?" -- john 7:20
.
Jesus answered them, "I did one deed, and you all marvel. -- john 7:21
.
"For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man. -- john 7:22
.
"If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath? -- john 7:23
.
"Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment." -- john 7:24
.
So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill? -- john 7:25
.
"Look, He is speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the Christ, do they? -- john 7:26
.
"However, we know where this man is from; but whenever the Christ may come, no one knows where He is from." -- john 7:27
.
Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know. -- john 7:28
.
"I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me." -- john 7:29
.
So they were seeking to seize Him; and no man laid his hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. -- john 7:30
.
But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were saying, "When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?" -- john 7:31
.
The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him. -- john 7:32
.
Therefore Jesus said, "For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me. -- john 7:33
.
"You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come." -- john 7:34
.
The Jews then said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He? -- john 7:35
.
"What is this statement that He said, 'You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come'?" -- john 7:36
.
Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. -- john 7:37
.
"He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.'" -- john 7:38
.
But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. -- john 7:39
.
Some of the people therefore, when they heard these words, were saying, "This certainly is the Prophet." -- john 7:40
.
Others were saying, "This is the Christ." Still others were saying, "Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He? -- john 7:41
.
"Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?" -- john 7:42
.
So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him. -- john 7:43
.
Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him. -- john 7:44
.
The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why did you not bring Him?" -- john 7:45
.
The officers answered, "Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks." -- john 7:46
.
The Pharisees then answered them, "You have not also been led astray, have you? -- john 7:47
.
"No one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him, has he? -- john 7:48
.
"But this crowd which does not know the Law is accursed." -- john 7:49
.
Nicodemus (he who came to Him before, being one of them) *said to them, -- john 7:50
.
"Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?" -- john 7:51
.
They answered him, "You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee." -- john 7:52
.
[Everyone went to his home. -- john 7:53
.
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. -- john 8:1
.
Early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and began to teach them. -- john 8:2
.
The scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center of the court, -- john 8:3
.
they *said to Him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act. -- john 8:4
.
"Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?" -- john 8:5
.
They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground. -- john 8:6
.
But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." -- john 8:7
.
Again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. -- john 8:8
.
When they heard it, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the center of the court. -- john 8:9
.
Straightening up, Jesus said to her, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?" -- john 8:10
.
She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more."] -- john 8:11
.
Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life." -- john 8:12
.
So the Pharisees said to Him, "You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not true." -- john 8:13
.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. -- john 8:14
.
"You judge according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone. -- john 8:15
.
"But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me. -- john 8:16
.
"Even in your law it has been written that the testimony of two men is true. -- john 8:17
.
"I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me." -- john 8:18
.
So they were saying to Him, "Where is Your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also." -- john 8:19
.
These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come. -- john 8:20
.
Then He said again to them, "I go away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come." -- john 8:21
.
So the Jews were saying, "Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?" -- john 8:22
.
And He was saying to them, "You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. -- john 8:23
.
"Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins." -- john 8:24
.
So they were saying to Him, "Who are You?" Jesus said to them, "What have I been saying to you from the beginning? -- john 8:25
.
"I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I speak to the world." -- john 8:26
.
They did not realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father. -- john 8:27
.
So Jesus said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me. -- john 8:28
.
"And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him." -- john 8:29
.
As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him. -- john 8:30
.
So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; -- john 8:31
.
and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." -- john 8:32
.
They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, 'You will become free'?" -- john 8:33
.
Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. -- john 8:34
.
"The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever. -- john 8:35
.
"So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. -- john 8:36
.
"I know that you are Abraham's descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you. -- john 8:37
.
"I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father." -- john 8:38
.
They answered and said to Him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus *said to them, "If you are Abraham's children, do the deeds of Abraham. -- john 8:39
.
"But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do. -- john 8:40
.
"You are doing the deeds of your father." They said to Him, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God." -- john 8:41
.
Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me. -- john 8:42
.
"Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word. -- john 8:43
.
"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. -- john 8:44
.
"But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me. -- john 8:45
.
"Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me? -- john 8:46
.
"He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God." -- john 8:47
.
The Jews answered and said to Him, "Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?" -- john 8:48
.
Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. -- john 8:49
.
"But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges. -- john 8:50
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he will never see death." -- john 8:51
.
The Jews said to Him, "Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets also; and You say, 'If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste of death.' -- john 8:52
.
"Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out to be?" -- john 8:53
.
Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God'; -- john 8:54
.
and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word. -- john 8:55
.
"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad." -- john 8:56
.
So the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?" -- john 8:57
.
Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am." -- john 8:58
.
Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple. -- john 8:59
.
As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth. -- john 9:1
.
And His disciples asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?" -- john 9:2
.
Jesus answered, "It was neither that this man sinned, nor his parents; but it was so that the works of God might be displayed in him. -- john 9:3
.
"We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming when no one can work. -- john 9:4
.
"While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world." -- john 9:5
.
When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes, -- john 9:6
.
and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing. -- john 9:7
.
Therefore the neighbors, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, "Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?" -- john 9:8
.
Others were saying, "This is he," still others were saying, "No, but he is like him." He kept saying, "I am the one." -- john 9:9
.
So they were saying to him, "How then were your eyes opened?" -- john 9:10
.
He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash'; so I went away and washed, and I received sight." -- john 9:11
.
They said to him, "Where is He?" He *said, "I do not know." -- john 9:12
.
They *brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind. -- john 9:13
.
Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. -- john 9:14
.
Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, "He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see." -- john 9:15
.
Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, "This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath." But others were saying, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?" And there was a division among them. -- john 9:16
.
So they *said to the blind man again, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?" And he said, "He is a prophet." -- john 9:17
.
The Jews then did not believe it of him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight, -- john 9:18
.
and questioned them, saying, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?" -- john 9:19
.
His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; -- john 9:20
.
but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself." -- john 9:21
.
His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue. -- john 9:22
.
For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; ask him." -- john 9:23
.
So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner." -- john 9:24
.
He then answered, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see." -- john 9:25
.
So they said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?" -- john 9:26
.
He answered them, "I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?" -- john 9:27
.
They reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. -- john 9:28
.
"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from." -- john 9:29
.
The man answered and said to them, "Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes. -- john 9:30
.
"We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him. -- john 9:31
.
"Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. -- john 9:32
.
"If this man were not from God, He could do nothing." -- john 9:33
.
They answered him, "You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?" So they put him out. -- john 9:34
.
Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, He said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" -- john 9:35
.
He answered, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?" -- john 9:36
.
Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you." -- john 9:37
.
And he said, "Lord, I believe." And he worshiped Him. -- john 9:38
.
And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind." -- john 9:39
.
Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, "We are not blind too, are we?" -- john 9:40
.
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, 'We see,' your sin remains. -- john 9:41
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. -- john 10:1
.
"But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep. -- john 10:2
.
"To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. -- john 10:3
.
"When he puts forth all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. -- john 10:4
.
"A stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers." -- john 10:5
.
This figure of speech Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them. -- john 10:6
.
So Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. -- john 10:7
.
"All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. -- john 10:8
.
"I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. -- john 10:9
.
"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. -- john 10:10
.
"I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. -- john 10:11
.
"He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. -- john 10:12
.
"He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep. -- john 10:13
.
"I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me, -- john 10:14
.
even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. -- john 10:15
.
"I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd. -- john 10:16
.
"For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it again. -- john 10:17
.
"No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father." -- john 10:18
.
A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words. -- john 10:19
.
Many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?" -- john 10:20
.
Others were saying, "These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?" -- john 10:21
.
At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem; -- john 10:22
.
it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon. -- john 10:23
.
The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, "How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly." -- john 10:24
.
Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father's name, these testify of Me. -- john 10:25
.
"But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep. -- john 10:26
.
"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; -- john 10:27
.
and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. -- john 10:28
.
"My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. -- john 10:29
.
"I and the Father are one." -- john 10:30
.
The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him. -- john 10:31
.
Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?" -- john 10:32
.
The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God." -- john 10:33
.
Jesus answered them, "Has it not been written in your Law, 'I SAID, YOU ARE GODS'? -- john 10:34
.
"If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), -- john 10:35
.
do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? -- john 10:36
.
"If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; -- john 10:37
.
but if I do them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father." -- john 10:38
.
Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, and He eluded their grasp. -- john 10:39
.
And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there. -- john 10:40
.
Many came to Him and were saying, "While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true." -- john 10:41
.
Many believed in Him there. -- john 10:42
.
Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. -- john 11:1
.
It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. -- john 11:2
.
So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick." -- john 11:3
.
But when Jesus heard this, He said, "This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it." -- john 11:4
.
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. -- john 11:5
.
So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was. -- john 11:6
.
Then after this He *said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again." -- john 11:7
.
The disciples *said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?" -- john 11:8
.
Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. -- john 11:9
.
"But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him." -- john 11:10
.
This He said, and after that He *said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep." -- john 11:11
.
The disciples then said to Him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover." -- john 11:12
.
Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep. -- john 11:13
.
So Jesus then said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead, -- john 11:14
.
and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him." -- john 11:15
.
Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with Him." -- john 11:16
.
So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. -- john 11:17
.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off; -- john 11:18
.
and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. -- john 11:19
.
Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house. -- john 11:20
.
Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. -- john 11:21
.
"Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You." -- john 11:22
.
Jesus *said to her, "Your brother will rise again." -- john 11:23
.
Martha *said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day." -- john 11:24
.
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies, -- john 11:25
.
and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?" -- john 11:26
.
She *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, even He who comes into the world." -- john 11:27
.
When she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you." -- john 11:28
.
And when she heard it, she *got up quickly and was coming to Him. -- john 11:29
.
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him. -- john 11:30
.
Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, when they saw that Mary got up quickly and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. -- john 11:31
.
Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died." -- john 11:32
.
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled, -- john 11:33
.
and said, "Where have you laid him?" They *said to Him, "Lord, come and see." -- john 11:34
.
Jesus wept. -- john 11:35
.
So the Jews were saying, "See how He loved him!" -- john 11:36
.
But some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?" -- john 11:37
.
So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. -- john 11:38
.
Jesus *said, "Remove the stone." Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, "Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days." -- john 11:39
.
Jesus *said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?" -- john 11:40
.
So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. -- john 11:41
.
"I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me." -- john 11:42
.
When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth." -- john 11:43
.
The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go." -- john 11:44
.
Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him. -- john 11:45
.
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done. -- john 11:46
.
Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, "What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs. -- john 11:47
.
"If we let Him go on like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation." -- john 11:48
.
But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all, -- john 11:49
.
nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish." -- john 11:50
.
Now he did not say this on his own initiative, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation, -- john 11:51
.
and not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. -- john 11:52
.
So from that day on they planned together to kill Him. -- john 11:53
.
Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples. -- john 11:54
.
Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover to purify themselves. -- john 11:55
.
So they were seeking for Jesus, and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?" -- john 11:56
.
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it, so that they might seize Him. -- john 11:57
.
Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. -- john 12:1
.
So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him. -- john 12:2
.
Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. -- john 12:3
.
But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, *said, -- john 12:4
.
"Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?" -- john 12:5
.
Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it. -- john 12:6
.
Therefore Jesus said, "Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial. -- john 12:7
.
"For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me." -- john 12:8
.
The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead. -- john 12:9
.
But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also; -- john 12:10
.
because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus. -- john 12:11
.
On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, -- john 12:12
.
took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began to shout, "Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, even the King of Israel." -- john 12:13
.
Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written, -- john 12:14
.
"FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY'S COLT." -- john 12:15
.
These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him. -- john 12:16
.
So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify about Him. -- john 12:17
.
For this reason also the people went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. -- john 12:18
.
So the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him." -- john 12:19
.
Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast; -- john 12:20
.
these then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and began to ask him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." -- john 12:21
.
Philip *came and *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus. -- john 12:22
.
And Jesus *answered them, saying, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. -- john 12:23
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. -- john 12:24
.
"He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal. -- john 12:25
.
"If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him. -- john 12:26
.
"Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour. -- john 12:27
.
"Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came out of heaven: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again." -- john 12:28
.
So the crowd of people who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him." -- john 12:29
.
Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes. -- john 12:30
.
"Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. -- john 12:31
.
"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself." -- john 12:32
.
But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die. -- john 12:33
.
The crowd then answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?" -- john 12:34
.
So Jesus said to them, "For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. -- john 12:35
.
"While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light." These things Jesus spoke, and He went away and hid Himself from them. -- john 12:36
.
But though He had performed so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him. -- john 12:37
.
This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: "LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED?" -- john 12:38
.
For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, -- john 12:39
.
"HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED AND I HEAL THEM." -- john 12:40
.
These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him. -- john 12:41
.
Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue; -- john 12:42
.
for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God. -- john 12:43
.
And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me, does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me. -- john 12:44
.
"He who sees Me sees the One who sent Me. -- john 12:45
.
"I have come as Light into the world, so that everyone who believes in Me will not remain in darkness. -- john 12:46
.
"If anyone hears My sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. -- john 12:47
.
"He who rejects Me and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day. -- john 12:48
.
"For I did not speak on My own initiative, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak. -- john 12:49
.
"I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me." -- john 12:50
.
Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end. -- john 13:1
.
During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him, -- john 13:2
.
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God, -- john 13:3
.
*got up from supper, and *laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself. -- john 13:4
.
Then He *poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded. -- john 13:5
.
So He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, "Lord, do You wash my feet?" -- john 13:6
.
Jesus answered and said to him, "What I do you do not realize now, but you will understand hereafter." -- john 13:7
.
Peter *said to Him, "Never shall You wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me." -- john 13:8
.
Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head." -- john 13:9
.
Jesus *said to him, "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you." -- john 13:10
.
For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, "Not all of you are clean." -- john 13:11
.
So when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you? -- john 13:12
.
"You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am. -- john 13:13
.
"If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. -- john 13:14
.
"For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you. -- john 13:15
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. -- john 13:16
.
"If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them. -- john 13:17
.
"I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'HE WHO EATS MY BREAD HAS LIFTED UP HIS HEEL AGAINST ME.' -- john 13:18
.
"From now on I am telling you before it comes to pass, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am He. -- john 13:19
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me." -- john 13:20
.
When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me." -- john 13:21
.
The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know of which one He was speaking. -- john 13:22
.
There was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. -- john 13:23
.
So Simon Peter *gestured to him, and *said to him, "Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking." -- john 13:24
.
He, leaning back thus on Jesus' bosom, *said to Him, "Lord, who is it?" -- john 13:25
.
Jesus then *answered, "That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him." So when He had dipped the morsel, He *took and *gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. -- john 13:26
.
After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, "What you do, do quickly." -- john 13:27
.
Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him. -- john 13:28
.
For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we have need of for the feast"; or else, that he should give something to the poor. -- john 13:29
.
So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night. -- john 13:30
.
Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus *said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him; -- john 13:31
.
if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately. -- john 13:32
.
"Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.' -- john 13:33
.
"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. -- john 13:34
.
"By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another." -- john 13:35
.
Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, "Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later." -- john 13:36
.
Peter *said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You." -- john 13:37
.
Jesus *answered, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times. -- john 13:38
.
"Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me. -- john 14:1
.
"In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. -- john 14:2
.
"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also. -- john 14:3
.
"And you know the way where I am going." -- john 14:4
.
Thomas *said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?" -- john 14:5
.
Jesus *said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me. -- john 14:6
.
"If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him." -- john 14:7
.
Philip *said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us." -- john 14:8
.
Jesus *said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, 'Show us the Father'? -- john 14:9
.
"Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works. -- john 14:10
.
"Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves. -- john 14:11
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father. -- john 14:12
.
"Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. -- john 14:13
.
"If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it. -- john 14:14
.
"If you love Me, you will keep My commandments. -- john 14:15
.
"I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; -- john 14:16
.
that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you. -- john 14:17
.
"I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. -- john 14:18
.
"After a little while the world will no longer see Me, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also. -- john 14:19
.
"In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. -- john 14:20
.
"He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him." -- john 14:21
.
Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, "Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world?" -- john 14:22
.
Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him. -- john 14:23
.
"He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me. -- john 14:24
.
"These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you. -- john 14:25
.
"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you. -- john 14:26
.
"Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful. -- john 14:27
.
"You heard that I said to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. -- john 14:28
.
"Now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. -- john 14:29
.
"I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me; -- john 14:30
.
but so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me. Get up, let us go from here. -- john 14:31
.
"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. -- john 15:1
.
"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit. -- john 15:2
.
"You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. -- john 15:3
.
"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. -- john 15:4
.
"I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. -- john 15:5
.
"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned. -- john 15:6
.
"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. -- john 15:7
.
"My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples. -- john 15:8
.
"Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love. -- john 15:9
.
"If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. -- john 15:10
.
"These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full. -- john 15:11
.
"This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. -- john 15:12
.
"Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. -- john 15:13
.
"You are My friends if you do what I command you. -- john 15:14
.
"No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. -- john 15:15
.
"You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you. -- john 15:16
.
"This I command you, that you love one another. -- john 15:17
.
"If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you. -- john 15:18
.
"If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you. -- john 15:19
.
"Remember the word that I said to you, 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also. -- john 15:20
.
"But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me. -- john 15:21
.
"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. -- john 15:22
.
"He who hates Me hates My Father also. -- john 15:23
.
"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well. -- john 15:24
.
"But they have done this to fulfill the word that is written in their Law, 'THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE.' -- john 15:25
.
"When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me, -- john 15:26
.
and you will testify also, because you have been with Me from the beginning. -- john 15:27
.
"These things I have spoken to you so that you may be kept from stumbling. -- john 16:1
.
"They will make you outcasts from the synagogue, but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God. -- john 16:2
.
"These things they will do because they have not known the Father or Me. -- john 16:3
.
"But these things I have spoken to you, so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them. These things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you. -- john 16:4
.
"But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?' -- john 16:5
.
"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. -- john 16:6
.
"But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. -- john 16:7
.
"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment; -- john 16:8
.
concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; -- john 16:9
.
and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer see Me; -- john 16:10
.
and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. -- john 16:11
.
"I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. -- john 16:12
.
"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. -- john 16:13
.
"He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you. -- john 16:14
.
"All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you. -- john 16:15
.
"A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me." -- john 16:16
.
Some of His disciples then said to one another, "What is this thing He is telling us, 'A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'; and, 'because I go to the Father'?" -- john 16:17
.
So they were saying, "What is this that He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is talking about." -- john 16:18
.
Jesus knew that they wished to question Him, and He said to them, "Are you deliberating together about this, that I said, 'A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me'? -- john 16:19
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will grieve, but your grief will be turned into joy. -- john 16:20
.
"Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain, because her hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world. -- john 16:21
.
"Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. -- john 16:22
.
"In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you. -- john 16:23
.
"Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full. -- john 16:24
.
"These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly of the Father. -- john 16:25
.
"In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf; -- john 16:26
.
for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from the Father. -- john 16:27
.
"I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; I am leaving the world again and going to the Father." -- john 16:28
.
His disciples *said, "Lo, now You are speaking plainly and are not using a figure of speech. -- john 16:29
.
"Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God." -- john 16:30
.
Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe? -- john 16:31
.
"Behold, an hour is coming, and has already come, for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. -- john 16:32
.
"These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world." -- john 16:33
.
Jesus spoke these things; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You, -- john 17:1
.
even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life. -- john 17:2
.
"This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. -- john 17:3
.
"I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do. -- john 17:4
.
"Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was. -- john 17:5
.
"I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. -- john 17:6
.
"Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You; -- john 17:7
.
for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received them and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me. -- john 17:8
.
"I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours; -- john 17:9
.
and all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them. -- john 17:10
.
"I am no longer in the world; and yet they themselves are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are. -- john 17:11
.
"While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. -- john 17:12
.
"But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. -- john 17:13
.
"I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. -- john 17:14
.
"I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. -- john 17:15
.
"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. -- john 17:16
.
"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. -- john 17:17
.
"As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. -- john 17:18
.
"For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. -- john 17:19
.
"I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; -- john 17:20
.
that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. -- john 17:21
.
"The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one; -- john 17:22
.
I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me. -- john 17:23
.
"Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. -- john 17:24
.
"O righteous Father, although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me; -- john 17:25
.
and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them." -- john 17:26
.
When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden, in which He entered with His disciples. -- john 18:1
.
Now Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples. -- john 18:2
.
Judas then, having received the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, *came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. -- john 18:3
.
So Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and *said to them, "Whom do you seek?" -- john 18:4
.
They answered Him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He *said to them, "I am He." And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them. -- john 18:5
.
So when He said to them, "I am He," they drew back and fell to the ground. -- john 18:6
.
Therefore He again asked them, "Whom do you seek?" And they said, "Jesus the Nazarene." -- john 18:7
.
Jesus answered, "I told you that I am He; so if you seek Me, let these go their way," -- john 18:8
.
to fulfill the word which He spoke, "Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one." -- john 18:9
.
Simon Peter then, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave's name was Malchus. -- john 18:10
.
So Jesus said to Peter, "Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" -- john 18:11
.
So the Roman cohort and the commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him, -- john 18:12
.
and led Him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. -- john 18:13
.
Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people. -- john 18:14
.
Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest, -- john 18:15
.
but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in. -- john 18:16
.
Then the slave-girl who kept the door *said to Peter, "You are not also one of this man's disciples, are you?" He *said, "I am not." -- john 18:17
.
Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself. -- john 18:18
.
The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching. -- john 18:19
.
Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret. -- john 18:20
.
"Why do you question Me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them; they know what I said." -- john 18:21
.
When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, "Is that the way You answer the high priest?" -- john 18:22
.
Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?" -- john 18:23
.
So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. -- john 18:24
.
Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, "You are not also one of His disciples, are you?" He denied it, and said, "I am not." -- john 18:25
.
One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, "Did I not see you in the garden with Him?" -- john 18:26
.
Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed. -- john 18:27
.
Then they *led Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. -- john 18:28
.
Therefore Pilate went out to them and *said, "What accusation do you bring against this Man?" -- john 18:29
.
They answered and said to him, "If this Man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him to you." -- john 18:30
.
So Pilate said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "We are not permitted to put anyone to death," -- john 18:31
.
to fulfill the word of Jesus which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die. -- john 18:32
.
Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" -- john 18:33
.
Jesus answered, "Are you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about Me?" -- john 18:34
.
Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me; what have You done?" -- john 18:35
.
Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm." -- john 18:36
.
Therefore Pilate said to Him, "So You are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say correctly that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice." -- john 18:37
.
Pilate *said to Him, "What is truth?" And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and *said to them, "I find no guilt in Him. -- john 18:38
.
"But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews?" -- john 18:39
.
So they cried out again, saying, "Not this Man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber. -- john 18:40
.
Pilate then took Jesus and scourged Him. -- john 19:1
.
And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe on Him; -- john 19:2
.
and they began to come up to Him and say, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and to give Him slaps in the face. -- john 19:3
.
Pilate came out again and *said to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him." -- john 19:4
.
Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate *said to them, "Behold, the Man!" -- john 19:5
.
So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out saying, "Crucify, crucify!" Pilate *said to them, "Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him." -- john 19:6
.
The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out to be the Son of God." -- john 19:7
.
Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid; -- john 19:8
.
and he entered into the Praetorium again and *said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. -- john 19:9
.
So Pilate *said to Him, "You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?" -- john 19:10
.
Jesus answered, "You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin." -- john 19:11
.
As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying, "If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar." -- john 19:12
.
Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. -- john 19:13
.
Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he *said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!" -- john 19:14
.
So they cried out, "Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!" Pilate *said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar." -- john 19:15
.
So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified. -- john 19:16
.
They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha. -- john 19:17
.
There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between. -- john 19:18
.
Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written, "JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS." -- john 19:19
.
Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin and in Greek. -- john 19:20
.
So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews'; but that He said, 'I am King of the Jews.'" -- john 19:21
.
Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written." -- john 19:22
.
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece. -- john 19:23
.
So they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be"; this was to fulfill the Scripture: "THEY DIVIDED MY OUTER GARMENTS AMONG THEM, AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS." -- john 19:24
.
Therefore the soldiers did these things. But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. -- john 19:25
.
When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son!" -- john 19:26
.
Then He *said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour the disciple took her into his own household. -- john 19:27
.
After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, *said, "I am thirsty." -- john 19:28
.
A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth. -- john 19:29
.
Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit. -- john 19:30
.
Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. -- john 19:31
.
So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him; -- john 19:32
.
but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. -- john 19:33
.
But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. -- john 19:34
.
And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. -- john 19:35
.
For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, "NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN." -- john 19:36
.
And again another Scripture says, "THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED." -- john 19:37
.
After these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret one for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body. -- john 19:38
.
Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. -- john 19:39
.
So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. -- john 19:40
.
Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. -- john 19:41
.
Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there. -- john 19:42
.
Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it *was still dark, and *saw the stone already taken away from the tomb. -- john 20:1
.
So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him." -- john 20:2
.
So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb. -- john 20:3
.
The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first; -- john 20:4
.
and stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings lying there; but he did not go in. -- john 20:5
.
And so Simon Peter also *came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he *saw the linen wrappings lying there, -- john 20:6
.
and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself. -- john 20:7
.
So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered, and he saw and believed. -- john 20:8
.
For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. -- john 20:9
.
So the disciples went away again to their own homes. -- john 20:10
.
But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; -- john 20:11
.
and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying. -- john 20:12
.
And they *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She *said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him." -- john 20:13
.
When she had said this, she turned around and *saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. -- john 20:14
.
Jesus *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" Supposing Him to be the gardener, she *said to Him, "Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away." -- john 20:15
.
Jesus *said to her, "Mary!" She turned and *said to Him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means, Teacher). -- john 20:16
.
Jesus *said to her, "Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'" -- john 20:17
.
Mary Magdalene *came, announcing to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord," and that He had said these things to her. -- john 20:18
.
So when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and *said to them, "Peace be with you." -- john 20:19
.
And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord. -- john 20:20
.
So Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you." -- john 20:21
.
And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. -- john 20:22
.
"If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained." -- john 20:23
.
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. -- john 20:24
.
So the other disciples were saying to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe." -- john 20:25
.
After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, "Peace be with you." -- john 20:26
.
Then He *said to Thomas, "Reach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing." -- john 20:27
.
Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!" -- john 20:28
.
Jesus *said to him, "Because you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed." -- john 20:29
.
Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; -- john 20:30
.
but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name. -- john 20:31
.
After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested Himself in this way. -- john 21:1
.
Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together. -- john 21:2
.
Simon Peter *said to them, "I am going fishing." They *said to him, "We will also come with you." They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing. -- john 21:3
.
But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. -- john 21:4
.
So Jesus *said to them, "Children, you do not have any fish, do you?" They answered Him, "No." -- john 21:5
.
And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find a catch." So they cast, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish. -- john 21:6
.
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, "It is the Lord." So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into the sea. -- john 21:7
.
But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fish. -- john 21:8
.
So when they got out on the land, they *saw a charcoal fire already laid and fish placed on it, and bread. -- john 21:9
.
Jesus *said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have now caught." -- john 21:10
.
Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn. -- john 21:11
.
Jesus *said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples ventured to question Him, "Who are You?" knowing that it was the Lord. -- john 21:12
.
Jesus *came and *took the bread and *gave it to them, and the fish likewise. -- john 21:13
.
This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead. -- john 21:14
.
So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Tend My lambs." -- john 21:15
.
He *said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Shepherd My sheep." -- john 21:16
.
He *said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, "Do you love Me?" And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You." Jesus *said to him, "Tend My sheep. -- john 21:17
.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do not wish to go." -- john 21:18
.
Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He *said to him, "Follow Me!" -- john 21:19
.
Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?" -- john 21:20
.
So Peter seeing him *said to Jesus, "Lord, and what about this man?" -- john 21:21
.
Jesus *said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!" -- john 21:22
.
Therefore this saying went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but only, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?" -- john 21:23
.
This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true. -- john 21:24
.
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they *were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself *would not contain the books that *would be written. -- john 21:25
.
The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach, -- acts 1:1
.
until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen. -- acts 1:2
.
To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God. -- acts 1:3
.
Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, "Which," He said, "you heard of from Me; -- acts 1:4
.
for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now." -- acts 1:5
.
So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, "Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?" -- acts 1:6
.
He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority; -- acts 1:7
.
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth." -- acts 1:8
.
And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. -- acts 1:9
.
And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them. -- acts 1:10
.
They also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven." -- acts 1:11
.
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away. -- acts 1:12
.
When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. -- acts 1:13
.
These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. -- acts 1:14
.
At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said, -- acts 1:15
.
"Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. -- acts 1:16
.
"For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry." -- acts 1:17
.
(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out. -- acts 1:18
.
And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) -- acts 1:19
.
"For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'LET HIS HOMESTEAD BE MADE DESOLATE, AND LET NO ONE DWELL IN IT'; and, 'LET ANOTHER MAN TAKE HIS OFFICE.' -- acts 1:20
.
"Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us-- -- acts 1:21
.
beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us--one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection." -- acts 1:22
.
So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias. -- acts 1:23
.
And they prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen -- acts 1:24
.
to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place." -- acts 1:25
.
And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles. -- acts 1:26
.
When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. -- acts 2:1
.
And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. -- acts 2:2
.
And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them. -- acts 2:3
.
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance. -- acts 2:4
.
Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. -- acts 2:5
.
And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language. -- acts 2:6
.
They were amazed and astonished, saying, "Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? -- acts 2:7
.
"And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born? -- acts 2:8
.
"Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, -- acts 2:9
.
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, -- acts 2:10
.
Cretans and Arabs--we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God." -- acts 2:11
.
And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" -- acts 2:12
.
But others were mocking and saying, "They are full of sweet wine." -- acts 2:13
.
But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: "Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words. -- acts 2:14
.
"For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day; -- acts 2:15
.
but this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel: -- acts 2:16
.
'AND IT SHALL BE IN THE LAST DAYS,' God says, 'THAT I WILL POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT ON ALL MANKIND; AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY, AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS, AND YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS; -- acts 2:17
.
EVEN ON MY BONDSLAVES, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, I WILL IN THOSE DAYS POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT And they shall prophesy. -- acts 2:18
.
'AND I WILL GRANT WONDERS IN THE SKY ABOVE AND SIGNS ON THE EARTH BELOW, BLOOD, AND FIRE, AND VAPOR OF SMOKE. -- acts 2:19
.
'THE SUN WILL BE TURNED INTO DARKNESS AND THE MOON INTO BLOOD, BEFORE THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS DAY OF THE LORD SHALL COME. -- acts 2:20
.
'AND IT SHALL BE THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.' -- acts 2:21
.
"Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know-- -- acts 2:22
.
this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death. -- acts 2:23
.
"But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power. -- acts 2:24
.
"For David says of Him, 'I SAW THE LORD ALWAYS IN MY PRESENCE; FOR HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND, SO THAT I WILL NOT BE SHAKEN. -- acts 2:25
.
'THEREFORE MY HEART WAS GLAD AND MY TONGUE EXULTED; MOREOVER MY FLESH ALSO WILL LIVE IN HOPE; -- acts 2:26
.
BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO HADES, NOR ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY. -- acts 2:27
.
'YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN TO ME THE WAYS OF LIFE; YOU WILL MAKE ME FULL OF GLADNESS WITH YOUR PRESENCE.' -- acts 2:28
.
"Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. -- acts 2:29
.
"And so, because he was a prophet and knew that GOD HAD SWORN TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT one OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE, -- acts 2:30
.
he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NEITHER ABANDONED TO HADES, NOR DID His flesh SUFFER DECAY. -- acts 2:31
.
"This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses. -- acts 2:32
.
"Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear. -- acts 2:33
.
"For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says: 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, -- acts 2:34
.
UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET."' -- acts 2:35
.
"Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ--this Jesus whom you crucified." -- acts 2:36
.
Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?" -- acts 2:37
.
Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. -- acts 2:38
.
"For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself." -- acts 2:39
.
And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, "Be saved from this perverse generation!" -- acts 2:40
.
So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls. -- acts 2:41
.
They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. -- acts 2:42
.
Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles. -- acts 2:43
.
And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common; -- acts 2:44
.
and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need. -- acts 2:45
.
Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, -- acts 2:46
.
praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved. -- acts 2:47
.
Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer. -- acts 3:1
.
And a man who had been lame from his mother's womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple. -- acts 3:2
.
When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms. -- acts 3:3
.
But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, "Look at us!" -- acts 3:4
.
And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. -- acts 3:5
.
But Peter said, "I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene--walk!" -- acts 3:6
.
And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened. -- acts 3:7
.
With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. -- acts 3:8
.
And all the people saw him walking and praising God; -- acts 3:9
.
and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. -- acts 3:10
.
While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement. -- acts 3:11
.
But when Peter saw this, he replied to the people, "Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or why do you gaze at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk? -- acts 3:12
.
"The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him. -- acts 3:13
.
"But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, -- acts 3:14
.
but put to death the Prince of life, the one whom God raised from the dead, a fact to which we are witnesses. -- acts 3:15
.
"And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. -- acts 3:16
.
"And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also. -- acts 3:17
.
"But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. -- acts 3:18
.
"Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; -- acts 3:19
.
and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you, -- acts 3:20
.
whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time. -- acts 3:21
.
"Moses said, 'THE LORD GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you. -- acts 3:22
.
'And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.' -- acts 3:23
.
"And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and his successors onward, also announced these days. -- acts 3:24
.
"It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'AND IN YOUR SEED ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED.' -- acts 3:25
.
"For you first, God raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways." -- acts 3:26
.
As they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them, -- acts 4:1
.
being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. -- acts 4:2
.
And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening. -- acts 4:3
.
But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand. -- acts 4:4
.
On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; -- acts 4:5
.
and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high-priestly descent. -- acts 4:6
.
When they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?" -- acts 4:7
.
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people, -- acts 4:8
.
if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well, -- acts 4:9
.
let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead--by this name this man stands here before you in good health. -- acts 4:10
.
"He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone. -- acts 4:11
.
"And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved." -- acts 4:12
.
Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed, and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus. -- acts 4:13
.
And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply. -- acts 4:14
.
But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they began to confer with one another, -- acts 4:15
.
saying, "What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. -- acts 4:16
.
"But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name." -- acts 4:17
.
And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. -- acts 4:18
.
But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge; -- acts 4:19
.
for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard." -- acts 4:20
.
When they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which to punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened; -- acts 4:21
.
for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed. -- acts 4:22
.
When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. -- acts 4:23
.
And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, "O Lord, it is You who MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM, -- acts 4:24
.
who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David Your servant, said, 'WHY DID THE GENTILES RAGE, AND THE PEOPLES DEVISE FUTILE THINGS? -- acts 4:25
.
'THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.' -- acts 4:26
.
"For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, -- acts 4:27
.
to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur. -- acts 4:28
.
"And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence, -- acts 4:29
.
while You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus." -- acts 4:30
.
And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness. -- acts 4:31
.
And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them. -- acts 4:32
.
And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all. -- acts 4:33
.
For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales -- acts 4:34
.
and lay them at the apostles' feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need. -- acts 4:35
.
Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement), -- acts 4:36
.
and who owned a tract of land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet. -- acts 4:37
.
But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, -- acts 5:1
.
and kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife's full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles' feet. -- acts 5:2
.
But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land? -- acts 5:3
.
"While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God." -- acts 5:4
.
And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it. -- acts 5:5
.
The young men got up and covered him up, and after carrying him out, they buried him. -- acts 5:6
.
Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. -- acts 5:7
.
And Peter responded to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?" And she said, "Yes, that was the price." -- acts 5:8
.
Then Peter said to her, "Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well." -- acts 5:9
.
And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. -- acts 5:10
.
And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things. -- acts 5:11
.
At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico. -- acts 5:12
.
But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem. -- acts 5:13
.
And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number, -- acts 5:14
.
to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them. -- acts 5:15
.
Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all being healed. -- acts 5:16
.
But the high priest rose up, along with all his associates (that is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy. -- acts 5:17
.
They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail. -- acts 5:18
.
But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the gates of the prison, and taking them out he said, -- acts 5:19
.
"Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life." -- acts 5:20
.
Upon hearing this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought. -- acts 5:21
.
But the officers who came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported back, -- acts 5:22
.
saying, "We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors; but when we had opened up, we found no one inside." -- acts 5:23
.
Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this. -- acts 5:24
.
But someone came and reported to them, "The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!" -- acts 5:25
.
Then the captain went along with the officers and proceeded to bring them back without violence (for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned). -- acts 5:26
.
When they had brought them, they stood them before the Council. The high priest questioned them, -- acts 5:27
.
saying, "We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us." -- acts 5:28
.
But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men. -- acts 5:29
.
"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross. -- acts 5:30
.
"He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. -- acts 5:31
.
"And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him." -- acts 5:32
.
But when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and intended to kill them. -- acts 5:33
.
But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time. -- acts 5:34
.
And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men. -- acts 5:35
.
"For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. -- acts 5:36
.
"After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered. -- acts 5:37
.
"So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will be overthrown; -- acts 5:38
.
but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God." -- acts 5:39
.
They took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then released them. -- acts 5:40
.
So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name. -- acts 5:41
.
And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ. -- acts 5:42
.
Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving of food. -- acts 6:1
.
So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, "It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables. -- acts 6:2
.
"Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task. -- acts 6:3
.
"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word." -- acts 6:4
.
The statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch. -- acts 6:5
.
And these they brought before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them. -- acts 6:6
.
The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith. -- acts 6:7
.
And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. -- acts 6:8
.
But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen. -- acts 6:9
.
But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking. -- acts 6:10
.
Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God." -- acts 6:11
.
And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council. -- acts 6:12
.
They put forward false witnesses who said, "This man incessantly speaks against this holy place and the Law; -- acts 6:13
.
for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us." -- acts 6:14
.
And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel. -- acts 6:15
.
The high priest said, "Are these things so?" -- acts 7:1
.
And he said, "Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, -- acts 7:2
.
and said to him, 'LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR RELATIVES, AND COME INTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU.' -- acts 7:3
.
"Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living. -- acts 7:4
.
"But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, even when he had no child, He promised that HE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM AS A POSSESSION, AND TO HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM. -- acts 7:5
.
"But God spoke to this effect, that his DESCENDANTS WOULD BE ALIENS IN A FOREIGN LAND, AND THAT THEY WOULD BE ENSLAVED AND MISTREATED FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. -- acts 7:6
.
" 'AND WHATEVER NATION TO WHICH THEY WILL BE IN BONDAGE I MYSELF WILL JUDGE,' said God, 'AND AFTER THAT THEY WILL COME OUT AND SERVE ME IN THIS PLACE.' -- acts 7:7
.
"And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs. -- acts 7:8
.
"The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. Yet God was with him, -- acts 7:9
.
and rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household. -- acts 7:10
.
"Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction with it, and our fathers could find no food. -- acts 7:11
.
"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time. -- acts 7:12
.
"On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was disclosed to Pharaoh. -- acts 7:13
.
"Then Joseph sent word and invited Jacob his father and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five persons in all. -- acts 7:14
.
"And Jacob went down to Egypt and there he and our fathers died. -- acts 7:15
.
"From there they were removed to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. -- acts 7:16
.
"But as the time of the promise was approaching which God had assured to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt, -- acts 7:17
.
until THERE AROSE ANOTHER KING OVER EGYPT WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT JOSEPH. -- acts 7:18
.
"It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive. -- acts 7:19
.
"It was at this time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God, and he was nurtured three months in his father's home. -- acts 7:20
.
"And after he had been set outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son. -- acts 7:21
.
"Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in words and deeds. -- acts 7:22
.
"But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel. -- acts 7:23
.
"And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian. -- acts 7:24
.
"And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand. -- acts 7:25
.
"On the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, 'Men, you are brethren, why do you injure one another?' -- acts 7:26
.
"But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, 'WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND JUDGE OVER US? -- acts 7:27
.
'YOU DO NOT MEAN TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN YESTERDAY, DO YOU?' -- acts 7:28
.
"At this remark, MOSES FLED AND BECAME AN ALIEN IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN, where he became the father of two sons. -- acts 7:29
.
"After forty years had passed, AN ANGEL APPEARED TO HIM IN THE WILDERNESS OF MOUNT Sinai, IN THE FLAME OF A BURNING THORN BUSH. -- acts 7:30
.
"When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, there came the voice of the Lord: -- acts 7:31
.
'I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AND JACOB.' Moses shook with fear and would not venture to look. -- acts 7:32
.
"BUT THE LORD SAID TO HIM, 'TAKE OFF THE SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET, FOR THE PLACE ON WHICH YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY GROUND. -- acts 7:33
.
'I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN THE OPPRESSION OF MY PEOPLE IN EGYPT AND HAVE HEARD THEIR GROANS, AND I HAVE COME DOWN TO RESCUE THEM; COME NOW, AND I WILL SEND YOU TO EGYPT.' -- acts 7:34
.
"This Moses whom they disowned, saying, 'WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND A JUDGE?' is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush. -- acts 7:35
.
"This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. -- acts 7:36
.
"This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, 'GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN.' -- acts 7:37
.
"This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and who was with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to you. -- acts 7:38
.
"Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him, but repudiated him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt, -- acts 7:39
.
SAYING TO AARON, 'MAKE FOR US GODS WHO WILL GO BEFORE US; FOR THIS MOSES WHO LED US OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT--WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.' -- acts 7:40
.
"At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. -- acts 7:41
.
"But God turned away and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'IT WAS NOT TO ME THAT YOU OFFERED VICTIMS AND SACRIFICES FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS, WAS IT, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL? -- acts 7:42
.
'YOU ALSO TOOK ALONG THE TABERNACLE OF MOLOCH AND THE STAR OF THE GOD ROMPHA, THE IMAGES WHICH YOU MADE TO WORSHIP. I ALSO WILL REMOVE YOU BEYOND BABYLON.' -- acts 7:43
.
"Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen. -- acts 7:44
.
"And having received it in their turn, our fathers brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations whom God drove out before our fathers, until the time of David. -- acts 7:45
.
"David found favor in God's sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. -- acts 7:46
.
"But it was Solomon who built a house for Him. -- acts 7:47
.
"However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says: -- acts 7:48
.
'HEAVEN IS MY THRONE, AND EARTH IS THE FOOTSTOOL OF MY FEET; WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WILL YOU BUILD FOR ME?' says the Lord, 'OR WHAT PLACE IS THERE FOR MY REPOSE? -- acts 7:49
.
'WAS IT NOT MY HAND WHICH MADE ALL THESE THINGS?' -- acts 7:50
.
"You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers did. -- acts 7:51
.
"Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become; -- acts 7:52
.
you who received the law as ordained by angels, and yet did not keep it." -- acts 7:53
.
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they began gnashing their teeth at him. -- acts 7:54
.
But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; -- acts 7:55
.
and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God." -- acts 7:56
.
But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse. -- acts 7:57
.
When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him; and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul. -- acts 7:58
.
They went on stoning Stephen as he called on the Lord and said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!" -- acts 7:59
.
Then falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them!" Having said this, he fell asleep. -- acts 7:60
.
Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. -- acts 8:1
.
Some devout men buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him. -- acts 8:2
.
But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison. -- acts 8:3
.
Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word. -- acts 8:4
.
Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them. -- acts 8:5
.
The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing. -- acts 8:6
.
For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed. -- acts 8:7
.
So there was much rejoicing in that city. -- acts 8:8
.
Now there was a man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great; -- acts 8:9
.
and they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, "This man is what is called the Great Power of God." -- acts 8:10
.
And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts. -- acts 8:11
.
But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike. -- acts 8:12
.
Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed. -- acts 8:13
.
Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John, -- acts 8:14
.
who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. -- acts 8:15
.
For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. -- acts 8:16
.
Then they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit. -- acts 8:17
.
Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, -- acts 8:18
.
saying, "Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit." -- acts 8:19
.
But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! -- acts 8:20
.
"You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. -- acts 8:21
.
"Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you. -- acts 8:22
.
"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity." -- acts 8:23
.
But Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me." -- acts 8:24
.
So, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans. -- acts 8:25
.
But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, "Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This is a desert road.) -- acts 8:26
.
So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship, -- acts 8:27
.
and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. -- acts 8:28
.
Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot." -- acts 8:29
.
Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?" -- acts 8:30
.
And he said, "Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. -- acts 8:31
.
Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: "HE WAS LED AS A SHEEP TO SLAUGHTER; AND AS A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT, SO HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH. -- acts 8:32
.
"IN HUMILIATION HIS JUDGMENT WAS TAKEN AWAY; WHO WILL RELATE HIS GENERATION? FOR HIS LIFE IS REMOVED FROM THE EARTH." -- acts 8:33
.
The eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself or of someone else?" -- acts 8:34
.
Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him. -- acts 8:35
.
As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?" -- acts 8:36
.
[And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."] -- acts 8:37
.
And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him. -- acts 8:38
.
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing. -- acts 8:39
.
But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea. -- acts 8:40
.
Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, -- acts 9:1
.
and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. -- acts 9:2
.
As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; -- acts 9:3
.
and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" -- acts 9:4
.
And he said, "Who are You, Lord?" And He said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, -- acts 9:5
.
but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do." -- acts 9:6
.
The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. -- acts 9:7
.
Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus. -- acts 9:8
.
And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. -- acts 9:9
.
Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he said, "Here I am, Lord." -- acts 9:10
.
And the Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying, -- acts 9:11
.
and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight." -- acts 9:12
.
But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem; -- acts 9:13
.
and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name." -- acts 9:14
.
But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; -- acts 9:15
.
for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name's sake." -- acts 9:16
.
So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." -- acts 9:17
.
And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized; -- acts 9:18
.
and he took food and was strengthened. Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus, -- acts 9:19
.
and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God." -- acts 9:20
.
All those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, "Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?" -- acts 9:21
.
But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ. -- acts 9:22
.
When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him, -- acts 9:23
.
but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death; -- acts 9:24
.
but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a large basket. -- acts 9:25
.
When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. -- acts 9:26
.
But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus. -- acts 9:27
.
And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. -- acts 9:28
.
And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were attempting to put him to death. -- acts 9:29
.
But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus. -- acts 9:30
.
So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase. -- acts 9:31
.
Now as Peter was traveling through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. -- acts 9:32
.
There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was paralyzed. -- acts 9:33
.
Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed." Immediately he got up. -- acts 9:34
.
And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. -- acts 9:35
.
Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translated in Greek is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity which she continually did. -- acts 9:36
.
And it happened at that time that she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upper room. -- acts 9:37
.
Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, "Do not delay in coming to us." -- acts 9:38
.
So Peter arose and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing all the tunics and garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them. -- acts 9:39
.
But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. -- acts 9:40
.
And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. -- acts 9:41
.
It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. -- acts 9:42
.
And Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon. -- acts 9:43
.
Now there was a man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort, -- acts 10:1
.
a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many alms to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually. -- acts 10:2
.
About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, "Cornelius!" -- acts 10:3
.
And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God. -- acts 10:4
.
"Now dispatch some men to Joppa and send for a man named Simon, who is also called Peter; -- acts 10:5
.
he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea." -- acts 10:6
.
When the angel who was speaking to him had left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants, -- acts 10:7
.
and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. -- acts 10:8
.
On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. -- acts 10:9
.
But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance; -- acts 10:10
.
and he *saw the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground, -- acts 10:11
.
and there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air. -- acts 10:12
.
A voice came to him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat!" -- acts 10:13
.
But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean." -- acts 10:14
.
Again a voice came to him a second time, "What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy." -- acts 10:15
.
This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky. -- acts 10:16
.
Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions for Simon's house, appeared at the gate; -- acts 10:17
.
and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there. -- acts 10:18
.
While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you. -- acts 10:19
.
"But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself." -- acts 10:20
.
Peter went down to the men and said, "Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?" -- acts 10:21
.
They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was divinely directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and hear a message from you." -- acts 10:22
.
So he invited them in and gave them lodging. And on the next day he got up and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. -- acts 10:23
.
On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. -- acts 10:24
.
When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped him. -- acts 10:25
.
But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am just a man." -- acts 10:26
.
As he talked with him, he entered and *found many people assembled. -- acts 10:27
.
And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean. -- acts 10:28
.
"That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you have sent for me." -- acts 10:29
.
Cornelius said, "Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments, -- acts 10:30
.
and he *said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. -- acts 10:31
.
'Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.' -- acts 10:32
.
"So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord." -- acts 10:33
.
Opening his mouth, Peter said: "I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality, -- acts 10:34
.
but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him. -- acts 10:35
.
"The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)-- -- acts 10:36
.
you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed. -- acts 10:37
.
"You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. -- acts 10:38
.
"We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross. -- acts 10:39
.
"God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible, -- acts 10:40
.
not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. -- acts 10:41
.
"And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead. -- acts 10:42
.
"Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins." -- acts 10:43
.
While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message. -- acts 10:44
.
All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. -- acts 10:45
.
For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered, -- acts 10:46
.
"Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?" -- acts 10:47
.
And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days. -- acts 10:48
.
Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. -- acts 11:1
.
And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with him, -- acts 11:2
.
saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them." -- acts 11:3
.
But Peter began speaking and proceeded to explain to them in orderly sequence, saying, -- acts 11:4
.
"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came right down to me, -- acts 11:5
.
and when I had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air. -- acts 11:6
.
"I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.' -- acts 11:7
.
"But I said, 'By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' -- acts 11:8
.
"But a voice from heaven answered a second time, 'What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.' -- acts 11:9
.
"This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky. -- acts 11:10
.
"And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea. -- acts 11:11
.
"The Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings. These six brethren also went with me and we entered the man's house. -- acts 11:12
.
"And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, 'Send to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here; -- acts 11:13
.
and he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.' -- acts 11:14
.
"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as He did upon us at the beginning. -- acts 11:15
.
"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' -- acts 11:16
.
"Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?" -- acts 11:17
.
When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, "Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life." -- acts 11:18
.
So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone. -- acts 11:19
.
But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus. -- acts 11:20
.
And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. -- acts 11:21
.
The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch. -- acts 11:22
.
Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord; -- acts 11:23
.
for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord. -- acts 11:24
.
And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul; -- acts 11:25
.
and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. -- acts 11:26
.
Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. -- acts 11:27
.
One of them named Agabus stood up and began to indicate by the Spirit that there would certainly be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the reign of Claudius. -- acts 11:28
.
And in the proportion that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send a contribution for the relief of the brethren living in Judea. -- acts 11:29
.
And this they did, sending it in charge of Barnabas and Saul to the elders. -- acts 11:30
.
Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them. -- acts 12:1
.
And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword. -- acts 12:2
.
When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread. -- acts 12:3
.
When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people. -- acts 12:4
.
So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God. -- acts 12:5
.
On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison. -- acts 12:6
.
And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and woke him up, saying, "Get up quickly." And his chains fell off his hands. -- acts 12:7
.
And the angel said to him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he *said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me." -- acts 12:8
.
And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. -- acts 12:9
.
When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. -- acts 12:10
.
When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting." -- acts 12:11
.
And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. -- acts 12:12
.
When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer. -- acts 12:13
.
When she recognized Peter's voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate. -- acts 12:14
.
They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, "It is his angel." -- acts 12:15
.
But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the door, they saw him and were amazed. -- acts 12:16
.
But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, "Report these things to James and the brethren." Then he left and went to another place. -- acts 12:17
.
Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what could have become of Peter. -- acts 12:18
.
When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there. -- acts 12:19
.
Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one accord they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king's chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was fed by the king's country. -- acts 12:20
.
On an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them. -- acts 12:21
.
The people kept crying out, "The voice of a god and not of a man!" -- acts 12:22
.
And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died. -- acts 12:23
.
But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied. -- acts 12:24
.
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark. -- acts 12:25
.
Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. -- acts 13:1
.
While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." -- acts 13:2
.
Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. -- acts 13:3
.
So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus. -- acts 13:4
.
When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper. -- acts 13:5
.
When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus, -- acts 13:6
.
who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. -- acts 13:7
.
But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. -- acts 13:8
.
But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him, -- acts 13:9
.
and said, "You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord? -- acts 13:10
.
"Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time." And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand. -- acts 13:11
.
Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord. -- acts 13:12
.
Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem. -- acts 13:13
.
But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. -- acts 13:14
.
After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it." -- acts 13:15
.
Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen: -- acts 13:16
.
"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it. -- acts 13:17
.
"For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness. -- acts 13:18
.
"When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance--all of which took about four hundred and fifty years. -- acts 13:19
.
"After these things He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. -- acts 13:20
.
"Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. -- acts 13:21
.
"After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, 'I HAVE FOUND DAVID the son of Jesse, A MAN AFTER MY HEART, who will do all My will.' -- acts 13:22
.
"From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, -- acts 13:23
.
after John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. -- acts 13:24
.
"And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not He. But behold, one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.' -- acts 13:25
.
"Brethren, sons of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent. -- acts 13:26
.
"For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning Him. -- acts 13:27
.
"And though they found no ground for putting Him to death, they asked Pilate that He be executed. -- acts 13:28
.
"When they had carried out all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb. -- acts 13:29
.
"But God raised Him from the dead; -- acts 13:30
.
and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people. -- acts 13:31
.
"And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers, -- acts 13:32
.
that God has fulfilled this promise to our children in that He raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'YOU ARE MY SON; TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU.' -- acts 13:33
.
"As for the fact that He raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: 'I WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY and SURE blessings OF DAVID.' -- acts 13:34
.
"Therefore He also says in another Psalm, 'YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.' -- acts 13:35
.
"For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay; -- acts 13:36
.
but He whom God raised did not undergo decay. -- acts 13:37
.
"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, -- acts 13:38
.
and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses. -- acts 13:39
.
"Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon you: -- acts 13:40
.
'BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.'" -- acts 13:41
.
As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath. -- acts 13:42
.
Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God. -- acts 13:43
.
The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord. -- acts 13:44
.
But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming. -- acts 13:45
.
Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. -- acts 13:46
.
"For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I HAVE PLACED YOU AS A LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES, THAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH.'" -- acts 13:47
.
When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed. -- acts 13:48
.
And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region. -- acts 13:49
.
But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. -- acts 13:50
.
But they shook off the dust of their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium. -- acts 13:51
.
And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. -- acts 13:52
.
In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks. -- acts 14:1
.
But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren. -- acts 14:2
.
Therefore they spent a long time there speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands. -- acts 14:3
.
But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles. -- acts 14:4
.
And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them, -- acts 14:5
.
they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region; -- acts 14:6
.
and there they continued to preach the gospel. -- acts 14:7
.
At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked. -- acts 14:8
.
This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well, -- acts 14:9
.
said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he leaped up and began to walk. -- acts 14:10
.
When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have become like men and have come down to us." -- acts 14:11
.
And they began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. -- acts 14:12
.
The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. -- acts 14:13
.
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out -- acts 14:14
.
and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM. -- acts 14:15
.
"In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways; -- acts 14:16
.
and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness." -- acts 14:17
.
Even saying these things, with difficulty they restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them. -- acts 14:18
.
But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. -- acts 14:19
.
But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe. -- acts 14:20
.
After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, -- acts 14:21
.
strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, "Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God." -- acts 14:22
.
When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed. -- acts 14:23
.
They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia. -- acts 14:24
.
When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. -- acts 14:25
.
From there they sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished. -- acts 14:26
.
When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they began to report all things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. -- acts 14:27
.
And they spent a long time with the disciples. -- acts 14:28
.
Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved." -- acts 15:1
.
And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue. -- acts 15:2
.
Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy to all the brethren. -- acts 15:3
.
When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them. -- acts 15:4
.
But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses." -- acts 15:5
.
The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter. -- acts 15:6
.
After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe. -- acts 15:7
.
"And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us; -- acts 15:8
.
and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. -- acts 15:9
.
"Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? -- acts 15:10
.
"But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are." -- acts 15:11
.
All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. -- acts 15:12
.
After they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, "Brethren, listen to me. -- acts 15:13
.
"Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name. -- acts 15:14
.
"With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, -- acts 15:15
.
'AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT, -- acts 15:16
.
SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME,' -- acts 15:17
.
SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO. -- acts 15:18
.
"Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles, -- acts 15:19
.
but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood. -- acts 15:20
.
"For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath." -- acts 15:21
.
Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas--Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, -- acts 15:22
.
and they sent this letter by them, "The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings. -- acts 15:23
.
"Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with their words, unsettling your souls, -- acts 15:24
.
it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, -- acts 15:25
.
men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- acts 15:26
.
"Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word of mouth. -- acts 15:27
.
"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials: -- acts 15:28
.
that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell." -- acts 15:29
.
So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. -- acts 15:30
.
When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. -- acts 15:31
.
Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message. -- acts 15:32
.
After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out. -- acts 15:33
.
[But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.] -- acts 15:34
.
But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord. -- acts 15:35
.
After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are." -- acts 15:36
.
Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. -- acts 15:37
.
But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. -- acts 15:38
.
And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. -- acts 15:39
.
But Paul chose Silas and left, being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. -- acts 15:40
.
And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. -- acts 15:41
.
Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek, -- acts 16:1
.
and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium. -- acts 16:2
.
Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. -- acts 16:3
.
Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe. -- acts 16:4
.
So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily. -- acts 16:5
.
They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; -- acts 16:6
.
and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them; -- acts 16:7
.
and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. -- acts 16:8
.
A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." -- acts 16:9
.
When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. -- acts 16:10
.
So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis; -- acts 16:11
.
and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony; and we were staying in this city for some days. -- acts 16:12
.
And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled. -- acts 16:13
.
A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul. -- acts 16:14
.
And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us. -- acts 16:15
.
It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling. -- acts 16:16
.
