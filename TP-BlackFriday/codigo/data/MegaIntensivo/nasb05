Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, explained the law to the people while the people remained in their place. -- nehemiah 8:7
.
They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading. -- nehemiah 8:8
.
Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, "This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep." For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law. -- nehemiah 8:9
.
Then he said to them, "Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength." -- nehemiah 8:10
.
So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved." -- nehemiah 8:11
.
All the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been made known to them. -- nehemiah 8:12
.
Then on the second day the heads of fathers' households of all the people, the priests and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe that they might gain insight into the words of the law. -- nehemiah 8:13
.
They found written in the law how the LORD had commanded through Moses that the sons of Israel should live in booths during the feast of the seventh month. -- nehemiah 8:14
.
So they proclaimed and circulated a proclamation in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the hills, and bring olive branches and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches and branches of other leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written." -- nehemiah 8:15
.
So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim. -- nehemiah 8:16
.
The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day. And there was great rejoicing. -- nehemiah 8:17
.
He read from the book of the law of God daily, from the first day to the last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance. -- nehemiah 8:18
.
Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting, in sackcloth and with dirt upon them. -- nehemiah 9:1
.
The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. -- nehemiah 9:2
.
While they stood in their place, they read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God. -- nehemiah 9:3
.
Now on the Levites' platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Chenani, and they cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God. -- nehemiah 9:4
.
Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah, said, "Arise, bless the LORD your God forever and ever! O may Your glorious name be blessed And exalted above all blessing and praise! -- nehemiah 9:5
.
"You alone are the LORD. You have made the heavens, The heaven of heavens with all their host, The earth and all that is on it, The seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them And the heavenly host bows down before You. -- nehemiah 9:6
.
"You are the LORD God, Who chose Abram And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees, And gave him the name Abraham. -- nehemiah 9:7
.
"You found his heart faithful before You, And made a covenant with him To give him the land of the Canaanite, Of the Hittite and the Amorite, Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite-- To give it to his descendants. And You have fulfilled Your promise, For You are righteous. -- nehemiah 9:8
.
"You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, And heard their cry by the Red Sea. -- nehemiah 9:9
.
"Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, Against all his servants and all the people of his land; For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them, And made a name for Yourself as it is this day. -- nehemiah 9:10
.
"You divided the sea before them, So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground; And their pursuers You hurled into the depths, Like a stone into raging waters. -- nehemiah 9:11
.
"And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day, And with a pillar of fire by night To light for them the way In which they were to go. -- nehemiah 9:12
.
"Then You came down on Mount Sinai, And spoke with them from heaven; You gave them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments. -- nehemiah 9:13
.
"So You made known to them Your holy sabbath, And laid down for them commandments, statutes and law, Through Your servant Moses. -- nehemiah 9:14
.
"You provided bread from heaven for them for their hunger, You brought forth water from a rock for them for their thirst, And You told them to enter in order to possess The land which You swore to give them. -- nehemiah 9:15
.
"But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly; They became stubborn and would not listen to Your commandments. -- nehemiah 9:16
.
"They refused to listen, And did not remember Your wondrous deeds which You had performed among them; So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a God of forgiveness, Gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness; And You did not forsake them. -- nehemiah 9:17
.
"Even when they made for themselves A calf of molten metal And said, 'This is your God Who brought you up from Egypt,' And committed great blasphemies, -- nehemiah 9:18
.
You, in Your great compassion, Did not forsake them in the wilderness; The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day, To guide them on their way, Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were to go. -- nehemiah 9:19
.
"You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, Your manna You did not withhold from their mouth, And You gave them water for their thirst. -- nehemiah 9:20
.
"Indeed, forty years You provided for them in the wilderness and they were not in want; Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell. -- nehemiah 9:21
.
"You also gave them kingdoms and peoples, And allotted them to them as a boundary. They took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon And the land of Og the king of Bashan. -- nehemiah 9:22
.
"You made their sons numerous as the stars of heaven, And You brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers to enter and possess. -- nehemiah 9:23
.
"So their sons entered and possessed the land. And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, To do with them as they desired. -- nehemiah 9:24
.
"They captured fortified cities and a fertile land. They took possession of houses full of every good thing, Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, Fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled and grew fat, And reveled in Your great goodness. -- nehemiah 9:25
.
"But they became disobedient and rebelled against You, And cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets who had admonished them So that they might return to You, And they committed great blasphemies. -- nehemiah 9:26
.
"Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed them, But when they cried to You in the time of their distress, You heard from heaven, and according to Your great compassion You gave them deliverers who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors. -- nehemiah 9:27
.
"But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You; Therefore You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them. When they cried again to You, You heard from heaven, And many times You rescued them according to Your compassion, -- nehemiah 9:28
.
And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances, By which if a man observes them he shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen. -- nehemiah 9:29
.
"However, You bore with them for many years, And admonished them by Your Spirit through Your prophets, Yet they would not give ear. Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. -- nehemiah 9:30
.
"Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them or forsake them, For You are a gracious and compassionate God. -- nehemiah 9:31
.
"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness, Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You, Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people, From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day. -- nehemiah 9:32
.
"However, You are just in all that has come upon us; For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly. -- nehemiah 9:33
.
"For our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers have not kept Your law Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your admonitions with which You have admonished them. -- nehemiah 9:34
.
"But they, in their own kingdom, With Your great goodness which You gave them, With the broad and rich land which You set before them, Did not serve You or turn from their evil deeds. -- nehemiah 9:35
.
"Behold, we are slaves today, And as to the land which You gave to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty, Behold, we are slaves in it. -- nehemiah 9:36
.
"Its abundant produce is for the kings Whom You have set over us because of our sins; They also rule over our bodies And over our cattle as they please, So we are in great distress. -- nehemiah 9:37
.
"Now because of all this We are making an agreement in writing; And on the sealed document are the names of our leaders, our Levites and our priests." -- nehemiah 9:38
.
Now on the sealed document were the names of: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah, -- nehemiah 10:1

.

.

.
Now the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters, all those who had knowledge and understanding, -- nehemiah 10:28
.
are joining with their kinsmen, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God's law, which was given through Moses, God's servant, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of GOD our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes; -- nehemiah 10:29
.
and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons. -- nehemiah 10:30
.
As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the sabbath or a holy day; and we will forego the crops the seventh year and the exaction of every debt. -- nehemiah 10:31
.
We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: -- nehemiah 10:32
.
for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moon, for the appointed times, for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God. -- nehemiah 10:33
.
Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood among the priests, the Levites and the people so that they might bring it to the house of our God, according to our fathers' households, at fixed times annually, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law; -- nehemiah 10:34
.
and that they might bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree to the house of the LORD annually, -- nehemiah 10:35
.
and bring to the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks as it is written in the law, for the priests who are ministering in the house of our God. -- nehemiah 10:36
.
We will also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns. -- nehemiah 10:37
.
The priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes, and the Levites shall bring up the tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse. -- nehemiah 10:38
.
For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine and the oil to the chambers; there are the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who are ministering, the gatekeepers and the singers. Thus we will not neglect the house of our God. -- nehemiah 10:39
.
Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths remained in the other cities. -- nehemiah 11:1
.
And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 11:2
.
Now these are the heads of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah each lived on his own property in their cities--the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants. -- nehemiah 11:3
.
Some of the sons of Judah and some of the sons of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez; -- nehemiah 11:4
.
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. -- nehemiah 11:5

.
Now these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah; -- nehemiah 11:7
.
and after him Gabbai and Sallai, 928. -- nehemiah 11:8
.
Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city. -- nehemiah 11:9

.
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the leader of the house of God, -- nehemiah 11:11
.
and their kinsmen who performed the work of the temple, 822; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, -- nehemiah 11:12
.
and his kinsmen, heads of fathers' households, 242; and Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, -- nehemiah 11:13
.
and their brothers, valiant warriors, 128. And their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim. -- nehemiah 11:14
.
Now from the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; -- nehemiah 11:15

.
All the Levites in the holy city were 284. -- nehemiah 11:18
.
Also the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their brethren who kept watch at the gates, were 172. -- nehemiah 11:19
.
The rest of Israel, of the priests and of the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each on his own inheritance. -- nehemiah 11:20
.
But the temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants. -- nehemiah 11:21
.
Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from the sons of Asaph, who were the singers for the service of the house of God. -- nehemiah 11:22
.
For there was a commandment from the king concerning them and a firm regulation for the song leaders day by day. -- nehemiah 11:23
.
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king's representative in all matters concerning the people. -- nehemiah 11:24
.
Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the sons of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, and in Jekabzeel and its villages, -- nehemiah 11:25
.
and in Jeshua, in Moladah and Beth-pelet, -- nehemiah 11:26
.
and in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its towns, -- nehemiah 11:27
.
and in Ziklag, in Meconah and in its towns, -- nehemiah 11:28
.
and in En-rimmon, in Zorah and in Jarmuth, -- nehemiah 11:29
.
Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its towns. So they encamped from Beersheba as far as the valley of Hinnom. -- nehemiah 11:30
.
The sons of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash and Aija, at Bethel and its towns, -- nehemiah 11:31
.
at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, -- nehemiah 11:32
.
Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, -- nehemiah 11:33
.
Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, -- nehemiah 11:34
.
Lod and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. -- nehemiah 11:35
.
From the Levites, some divisions in Judah belonged to Benjamin. -- nehemiah 11:36
.
Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, -- nehemiah 12:1
.
Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, -- nehemiah 12:2
.
Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, -- nehemiah 12:3
.
Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, -- nehemiah 12:4
.
Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, -- nehemiah 12:5
.
Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah, -- nehemiah 12:6
.
Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of Jeshua. -- nehemiah 12:7
.
The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah who was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving, he and his brothers. -- nehemiah 12:8
.
Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in their service divisions. -- nehemiah 12:9
.
Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada, -- nehemiah 12:10
.
and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua. -- nehemiah 12:11
.
Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of fathers' households were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; -- nehemiah 12:12
.
of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; -- nehemiah 12:13
.
of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; -- nehemiah 12:14
.
of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; -- nehemiah 12:15
.
of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; -- nehemiah 12:16
.
of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; -- nehemiah 12:17
.
of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; -- nehemiah 12:18
.
of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; -- nehemiah 12:19
.
of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; -- nehemiah 12:20
.
of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel. -- nehemiah 12:21
.
As for the Levites, the heads of fathers' households were registered in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan and Jaddua; so were the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian. -- nehemiah 12:22
.
The sons of Levi, the heads of fathers' households, were registered in the Book of the Chronicles up to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. -- nehemiah 12:23
.
The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite them, to praise and give thanks, as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division. -- nehemiah 12:24
.
Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping watch at the storehouses of the gates. -- nehemiah 12:25
.
These served in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe. -- nehemiah 12:26
.
Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving and with songs to the accompaniment of cymbals, harps and lyres. -- nehemiah 12:27
.
So the sons of the singers were assembled from the district around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites, -- nehemiah 12:28
.
from Beth-gilgal and from their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 12:29
.
The priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the people, the gates and the wall. -- nehemiah 12:30
.
Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall, and I appointed two great choirs, the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Refuse Gate. -- nehemiah 12:31
.
Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, -- nehemiah 12:32
.
with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, -- nehemiah 12:33
.
Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, -- nehemiah 12:34
.
and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets; and Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, -- nehemiah 12:35
.
and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them. -- nehemiah 12:36
.
At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the city of David by the stairway of the wall above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east. -- nehemiah 12:37
.
The second choir proceeded to the left, while I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall, -- nehemiah 12:38
.
and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard. -- nehemiah 12:39
.
Then the two choirs took their stand in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials with me; -- nehemiah 12:40
.
and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah, with the trumpets; -- nehemiah 12:41
.
and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah their leader, -- nehemiah 12:42
.
and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar. -- nehemiah 12:43
.
On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served. -- nehemiah 12:44
.
For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command of David and of his son Solomon. -- nehemiah 12:45
.
For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders of the singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God. -- nehemiah 12:46
.
So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron. -- nehemiah 12:47
.
On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and there was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God, -- nehemiah 13:1
.
because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing. -- nehemiah 13:2
.
So when they heard the law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel. -- nehemiah 13:3
.
Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah, -- nehemiah 13:4
.
had prepared a large room for him, where formerly they put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils and the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. -- nehemiah 13:5
.
But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After some time, however, I asked leave from the king, -- nehemiah 13:6
.
and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God. -- nehemiah 13:7
.
It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah's household goods out of the room. -- nehemiah 13:8
.
Then I gave an order and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense. -- nehemiah 13:9
.
I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field. -- nehemiah 13:10
.
So I reprimanded the officials and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" Then I gathered them together and restored them to their posts. -- nehemiah 13:11
.
All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine and oil into the storehouses. -- nehemiah 13:12
.
In charge of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and in addition to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered reliable, and it was their task to distribute to their kinsmen. -- nehemiah 13:13
.
Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my loyal deeds which I have performed for the house of my God and its services. -- nehemiah 13:14
.
In those days I saw in Judah some who were treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sacks of grain and loading them on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs and all kinds of loads, and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. So I admonished them on the day they sold food. -- nehemiah 13:15
.
Also men of Tyre were living there who imported fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold them to the sons of Judah on the sabbath, even in Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 13:16
.
Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing you are doing, by profaning the sabbath day? -- nehemiah 13:17
.
"Did not your fathers do the same, so that our God brought on us and on this city all this trouble? Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath." -- nehemiah 13:18
.
It came about that just as it grew dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and that they should not open them until after the sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load would enter on the sabbath day. -- nehemiah 13:19
.
Once or twice the traders and merchants of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 13:20
.
Then I warned them and said to them, "Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you." From that time on they did not come on the sabbath. -- nehemiah 13:21
.
And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the sabbath day. For this also remember me, O my God, and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness. -- nehemiah 13:22
.
In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. -- nehemiah 13:23
.
As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none of them was able to speak the language of Judah, but the language of his own people. -- nehemiah 13:24
.
So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take of their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. -- nehemiah 13:25
.
"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin regarding these things? Yet among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin. -- nehemiah 13:26
.
"Do we then hear about you that you have committed all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?" -- nehemiah 13:27
.
Even one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me. -- nehemiah 13:28
.
Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. -- nehemiah 13:29
.
Thus I purified them from everything foreign and appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each in his task, -- nehemiah 13:30
.
and I arranged for the supply of wood at appointed times and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good. -- nehemiah 13:31
.
Now it took place in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over provinces, -- esther 1:1
.
in those days as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which was at the citadel in Susa, -- esther 1:2
.
in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and attendants, the army officers of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of his provinces being in his presence. -- esther 1:3
.
And he displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, days. -- esther 1:4
.
When these days were completed, the king gave a banquet lasting seven days for all the people who were present at the citadel in Susa, from the greatest to the least, in the court of the garden of the king's palace. -- esther 1:5
.
There were hangings of fine white and violet linen held by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble columns, and couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious stones. -- esther 1:6
.
Drinks were served in golden vessels of various kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king's bounty. -- esther 1:7
.
The drinking was done according to the law, there was no compulsion, for so the king had given orders to each official of his household that he should do according to the desires of each person. -- esther 1:8
.
Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus. -- esther 1:9
.
On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, -- esther 1:10
.
to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and the princes, for she was beautiful. -- esther 1:11
.
But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his wrath burned within him. -- esther 1:12
.
Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times--for it was the custom of the king so to speak before all who knew law and justice -- esther 1:13
.
and were close to him: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king's presence and sat in the first place in the kingdom-- -- esther 1:14
.
"According to law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?" -- esther 1:15
.
In the presence of the king and the princes, Memucan said, "Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but also all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. -- esther 1:16
.
"For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women causing them to look with contempt on their husbands by saying, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in to his presence, but she did not come.' -- esther 1:17
.
"This day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's conduct will speak in the same way to all the king's princes, and there will be plenty of contempt and anger. -- esther 1:18
.
"If it pleases the king, let a royal edict be issued by him and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti may no longer come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal position to another who is more worthy than she. -- esther 1:19
.
"When the king's edict which he will make is heard throughout all his kingdom, great as it is, then all women will give honor to their husbands, great and small." -- esther 1:20
.
This word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed. -- esther 1:21
.
So he sent letters to all the king's provinces, to each province according to its script and to every people according to their language, that every man should be the master in his own house and the one who speaks in the language of his own people. -- esther 1:22
.
After these things when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. -- esther 2:1
.
Then the king's attendants, who served him, said, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. -- esther 2:2
.
"Let the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather every beautiful young virgin to the citadel of Susa, to the harem, into the custody of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let their cosmetics be given them. -- esther 2:3
.
"Then let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti." And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly. -- esther 2:4
.
Now there was at the citadel in Susa a Jew whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, -- esther 2:5
.
who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled. -- esther 2:6
.
He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle's daughter, for she had no father or mother. Now the young lady was beautiful of form and face, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter. -- esther 2:7
.
So it came about when the command and decree of the king were heard and many young ladies were gathered to the citadel of Susa into the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king's palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women. -- esther 2:8
.
Now the young lady pleased him and found favor with him. So he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and food, gave her seven choice maids from the king's palace and transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem. -- esther 2:9
.
Esther did not make known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make them known. -- esther 2:10
.
Every day Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and how she fared. -- esther 2:11
.
Now when the turn of each young lady came to go in to King Ahasuerus, after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women--for the days of their beautification were completed as follows: six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and the cosmetics for women-- -- esther 2:12
.
the young lady would go in to the king in this way: anything that she desired was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace. -- esther 2:13
.
In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second harem, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not again go in to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name. -- esther 2:14
.
Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter, came to go in to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her. -- esther 2:15
.
So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. -- esther 2:16
.
The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. -- esther 2:17
.
Then the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his princes and his servants; he also made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts according to the king's bounty. -- esther 2:18
.
When the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate. -- esther 2:19
.
Esther had not yet made known her kindred or her people, even as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her as she had done when under his care. -- esther 2:20
.
In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's officials from those who guarded the door, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. -- esther 2:21
.
But the plot became known to Mordecai and he told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name. -- esther 2:22
.
Now when the plot was investigated and found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the Book of the Chronicles in the king's presence. -- esther 2:23
.
After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and established his authority over all the princes who were with him. -- esther 3:1
.
All the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage. -- esther 3:2
.
Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, "Why are you transgressing the king's command?" -- esther 3:3
.
Now it was when they had spoken daily to him and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew. -- esther 3:4
.
When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage. -- esther 3:5
.
But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who the people of Mordecai were; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus. -- esther 3:6
.
In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, Pur, that is the lot, was cast before Haman from day to day and from month to month, until the twelfth month, that is the month Adar. -- esther 3:7
.
Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of all other people and they do not observe the king's laws, so it is not in the king's interest to let them remain. -- esther 3:8
.
"If it is pleasing to the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry on the king's business, to put into the king's treasuries." -- esther 3:9
.
Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. -- esther 3:10
.
The king said to Haman, "The silver is yours, and the people also, to do with them as you please." -- esther 3:11
.
Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king's satraps, to the governors who were over each province and to the princes of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring. -- esther 3:12
.
Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces to destroy, to kill and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to seize their possessions as plunder. -- esther 3:13
.
A copy of the edict to be issued as law in every province was published to all the peoples so that they should be ready for this day. -- esther 3:14
.
The couriers went out impelled by the king's command while the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa; and while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in confusion. -- esther 3:15
.
When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and bitterly. -- esther 4:1
.
He went as far as the king's gate, for no one was to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth. -- esther 4:2
.
In each and every province where the command and decree of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing; and many lay on sackcloth and ashes. -- esther 4:3
.
Then Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her, and the queen writhed in great anguish. And she sent garments to clothe Mordecai that he might remove his sackcloth from him, but he did not accept them. -- esther 4:4
.
Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king's eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was. -- esther 4:5
.
So Hathach went out to Mordecai to the city square in front of the king's gate. -- esther 4:6
.
Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. -- esther 4:7
.
He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which had been issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show Esther and inform her, and to order her to go in to the king to implore his favor and to plead with him for her people. -- esther 4:8
.
Hathach came back and related Mordecai's words to Esther. -- esther 4:9
.
Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him to reply to Mordecai: -- esther 4:10
.
"All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king to the inner court who is not summoned, he has but one law, that he be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these thirty days." -- esther 4:11
.
They related Esther's words to Mordecai. -- esther 4:12
.
Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, "Do not imagine that you in the king's palace can escape any more than all the Jews. -- esther 4:13
.
"For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?" -- esther 4:14
.
Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, -- esther 4:15
.
"Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidens also will fast in the same way. And thus I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish." -- esther 4:16
.
So Mordecai went away and did just as Esther had commanded him. -- esther 4:17
.
Now it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace in front of the king's rooms, and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the palace. -- esther 5:1
.
When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which was in his hand. So Esther came near and touched the top of the scepter. -- esther 5:2
.
Then the king said to her, "What is troubling you, Queen Esther? And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be given to you." -- esther 5:3
.
Esther said, "If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him." -- esther 5:4
.
Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly that we may do as Esther desires." So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared. -- esther 5:5
.
As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, "What is your petition, for it shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done." -- esther 5:6
.
So Esther replied, "My petition and my request is: -- esther 5:7
.
if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and do what I request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king says." -- esther 5:8
.
Then Haman went out that day glad and pleased of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate and that he did not stand up or tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai. -- esther 5:9
.
Haman controlled himself, however, went to his house and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. -- esther 5:10
.
Then Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the number of his sons, and every instance where the king had magnified him and how he had promoted him above the princes and servants of the king. -- esther 5:11
.
Haman also said, "Even Esther the queen let no one but me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king. -- esther 5:12
.
"Yet all of this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate." -- esther 5:13
.
Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows fifty cubits high made and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet." And the advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made. -- esther 5:14
.
During that night the king could not sleep so he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king. -- esther 6:1
.
It was found written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. -- esther 6:2
.
The king said, "What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?" Then the king's servants who attended him said, "Nothing has been done for him." -- esther 6:3
.
So the king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace in order to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared for him. -- esther 6:4
.
The king's servants said to him, "Behold, Haman is standing in the court." And the king said, "Let him come in." -- esther 6:5
.
So Haman came in and the king said to him, "What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?" And Haman said to himself, "Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?" -- esther 6:6
.
Then Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king desires to honor, -- esther 6:7
.
let them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been placed; -- esther 6:8
.
and let the robe and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble princes and let them array the man whom the king desires to honor and lead him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor.'" -- esther 6:9
.
Then the king said to Haman, "Take quickly the robes and the horse as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king's gate; do not fall short in anything of all that you have said." -- esther 6:10
.
So Haman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, "Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor." -- esther 6:11
.
Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried home, mourning, with his head covered. -- esther 6:12
.
Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish origin, you will not overcome him, but will surely fall before him." -- esther 6:13
.
While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hastily brought Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared. -- esther 6:14
.
Now the king and Haman came to drink wine with Esther the queen. -- esther 7:1
.
And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine at the banquet, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done." -- esther 7:2
.
Then Queen Esther replied, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request; -- esther 7:3
.
for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the trouble would not be commensurate with the annoyance to the king." -- esther 7:4
.
Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do thus?" -- esther 7:5
.
Esther said, "A foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!" Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen. -- esther 7:6
.
The king arose in his anger from drinking wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king. -- esther 7:7
.
Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, "Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?" As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. -- esther 7:8
.
Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were before the king said, "Behold indeed, the gallows standing at Haman's house fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai who spoke good on behalf of the king!" And the king said, "Hang him on it." -- esther 7:9
.
So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king's anger subsided. -- esther 7:10
.
On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had disclosed what he was to her. -- esther 8:1
.
The king took off his signet ring which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. -- esther 8:2
.
Then Esther spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, wept and implored him to avert the evil scheme of Haman the Agagite and his plot which he had devised against the Jews. -- esther 8:3
.
The king extended the golden scepter to Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king. -- esther 8:4
.
Then she said, "If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him and the matter seems proper to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces. -- esther 8:5
.
"For how can I endure to see the calamity which will befall my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?" -- esther 8:6
.
So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and him they have hanged on the gallows because he had stretched out his hands against the Jews. -- esther 8:7
.
"Now you write to the Jews as you see fit, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's signet ring; for a decree which is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's signet ring may not be revoked." -- esther 8:8
.
So the king's scribes were called at that time in the third month (that is, the month Sivan), on the twenty-third day; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, the satraps, the governors and the princes of the provinces which extended from India to Ethiopia, provinces, to every province according to its script, and to every people according to their language as well as to the Jews according to their script and their language. -- esther 8:9
.
He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses, riding on steeds sired by the royal stud. -- esther 8:10
.
In them the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city the right to assemble and to defend their lives, to destroy, to kill and to annihilate the entire army of any people or province which might attack them, including children and women, and to plunder their spoil, -- esther 8:11
.
on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar). -- esther 8:12
.
A copy of the edict to be issued as law in each and every province was published to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready for this day to avenge themselves on their enemies. -- esther 8:13
.
The couriers, hastened and impelled by the king's command, went out, riding on the royal steeds; and the decree was given out at the citadel in Susa. -- esther 8:14
.
Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a large crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. -- esther 8:15
.
For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor. -- esther 8:16
.
In each and every province and in each and every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree arrived, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many among the peoples of the land became Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen on them. -- esther 8:17
.
Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar), on the thirteenth day when the king's command and edict were about to be executed, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, it was turned to the contrary so that the Jews themselves gained the mastery over those who hated them. -- esther 9:1
.
The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm; and no one could stand before them, for the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples. -- esther 9:2
.
Even all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who were doing the king's business assisted the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. -- esther 9:3
.
Indeed, Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater. -- esther 9:4
.
Thus the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying; and they did what they pleased to those who hated them. -- esther 9:5
.
At the citadel in Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men, -- esther 9:6
.
and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, -- esther 9:7
.
Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, -- esther 9:8
.
Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha, -- esther 9:9
.
the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. -- esther 9:10
.
On that day the number of those who were killed at the citadel in Susa was reported to the king. -- esther 9:11
.
The king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman at the citadel in Susa. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall even be granted you. And what is your further request? It shall also be done." -- esther 9:12
.
Then said Esther, "If it pleases the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows." -- esther 9:13
.
So the king commanded that it should be done so; and an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman's ten sons were hanged. -- esther 9:14
.
The Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. -- esther 9:15
.
Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king's provinces assembled, to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies, and kill 75,of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. -- esther 9:16
.
This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. -- esther 9:17
.
But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month, and they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. -- esther 9:18
.
Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending portions of food to one another. -- esther 9:19
.
Then Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, -- esther 9:20
.
obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually, -- esther 9:21
.
because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies, and it was a month which was turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and rejoicing and sending portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor. -- esther 9:22
.
Thus the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them. -- esther 9:23
.
For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and destroy them. -- esther 9:24
.
But when it came to the king's attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. -- esther 9:25
.
Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them, -- esther 9:26
.
the Jews established and made a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation and according to their appointed time annually. -- esther 9:27
.
So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province and every city; and these days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews, or their memory fade from their descendants. -- esther 9:28
.
Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. -- esther 9:29
.
He sent letters to all the Jews, to the provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, namely, words of peace and truth, -- esther 9:30
.
to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants with instructions for their times of fasting and their lamentations. -- esther 9:31
.
The command of Esther established these customs for Purim, and it was written in the book. -- esther 9:32
.
Now King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea. -- esther 10:1
.
And all the accomplishments of his authority and strength, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? -- esther 10:2
.
For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and in favor with his many kinsmen, one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his whole nation. -- esther 10:3
.
There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil. -- job 1:1
.
Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. -- job 1:2
.
His possessions also were 7,sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east. -- job 1:3
.
His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. -- job 1:4
.
When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, "Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually. -- job 1:5
.
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. -- job 1:6
.
The LORD said to Satan, "From where do you come?" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it." -- job 1:7
.
The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil." -- job 1:8
.
Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing? -- job 1:9
.
"Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. -- job 1:10
.
"But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face." -- job 1:11
.
Then the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him." So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD. -- job 1:12
.
Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, -- job 1:13
.
a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, -- job 1:14
.
and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you." -- job 1:15
.
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you." -- job 1:16
.
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you." -- job 1:17
.
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, -- job 1:18
.
and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you." -- job 1:19
.
Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped. -- job 1:20
.
He said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD." -- job 1:21
.
Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God. -- job 1:22
.
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD. -- job 2:1
.
The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it." -- job 2:2
.
The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause." -- job 2:3
.
Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. -- job 2:4
.
"However, put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face." -- job 2:5
.
So the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life." -- job 2:6
.
Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. -- job 2:7
.
And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes. -- job 2:8
.
Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die!" -- job 2:9
.
But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips. -- job 2:10
.
Now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him. -- job 2:11
.
When they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky. -- job 2:12
.
Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great. -- job 2:13
.
Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. -- job 3:1
.
And Job said, -- job 3:2
.
"Let the day perish on which I was to be born, And the night which said, 'A boy is conceived.' -- job 3:3
.
"May that day be darkness; Let not God above care for it, Nor light shine on it. -- job 3:4
.
"Let darkness and black gloom claim it; Let a cloud settle on it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it. -- job 3:5
.
"As for that night, let darkness seize it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months. -- job 3:6
.
"Behold, let that night be barren; Let no joyful shout enter it. -- job 3:7
.
"Let those curse it who curse the day, Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan. -- job 3:8
.
"Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; Let it wait for light but have none, And let it not see the breaking dawn; -- job 3:9
.
Because it did not shut the opening of my mother's womb, Or hide trouble from my eyes. -- job 3:10
.
"Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and expire? -- job 3:11
.
"Why did the knees receive me, And why the breasts, that I should suck? -- job 3:12
.
"For now I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept then, I would have been at rest, -- job 3:13
.
With kings and with counselors of the earth, Who rebuilt ruins for themselves; -- job 3:14
.
Or with princes who had gold, Who were filling their houses with silver. -- job 3:15
.
"Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be, As infants that never saw light. -- job 3:16
.
"There the wicked cease from raging, And there the weary are at rest. -- job 3:17
.
"The prisoners are at ease together; They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster. -- job 3:18
.
"The small and the great are there, And the slave is free from his master. -- job 3:19
.
"Why is light given to him who suffers, And life to the bitter of soul, -- job 3:20
.
Who long for death, but there is none, And dig for it more than for hidden treasures, -- job 3:21
.
Who rejoice greatly, And exult when they find the grave? -- job 3:22
.
"Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in? -- job 3:23
.
"For my groaning comes at the sight of my food, And my cries pour out like water. -- job 3:24
.
"For what I fear comes upon me, And what I dread befalls me. -- job 3:25
.
"I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes." -- job 3:26
.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, -- job 4:1
.
"If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can refrain from speaking? -- job 4:2
.
"Behold you have admonished many, And you have strengthened weak hands. -- job 4:3
.
"Your words have helped the tottering to stand, And you have strengthened feeble knees. -- job 4:4
.
"But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; It touches you, and you are dismayed. -- job 4:5
.
"Is not your fear of God your confidence, And the integrity of your ways your hope? -- job 4:6
.
"Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed? -- job 4:7
.
"According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity And those who sow trouble harvest it. -- job 4:8
.
"By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they come to an end. -- job 4:9
.
"The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken. -- job 4:10
.
"The lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered. -- job 4:11
.
"Now a word was brought to me stealthily, And my ear received a whisper of it. -- job 4:12
.
"Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men, -- job 4:13
.
Dread came upon me, and trembling, And made all my bones shake. -- job 4:14
.
"Then a spirit passed by my face; The hair of my flesh bristled up. -- job 4:15
.
"It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes; There was silence, then I heard a voice: -- job 4:16
.
'Can mankind be just before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker? -- job 4:17
.
'He puts no trust even in His servants; And against His angels He charges error. -- job 4:18

'How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth! -- job 4:19

'Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces; Unobserved, they perish forever. -- job 4:20

'Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, yet without wisdom.' -- job 4:21

"Call now, is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn? -- job 5:1

"For anger slays the foolish man, And jealousy kills the simple. -- job 5:2

"He captures the wise by their own shrewdness, And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted. -- job 5:13

"By day they meet with darkness, And grope at noon as in the night. -- job 5:14

"But He saves from the sword of their mouth, And the poor from the hand of the mighty. -- job 5:15

"A noose for him is hidden in the ground, And a trap for him on the path. -- job 18:10
.
"All around terrors frighten him, And harry him at every step. -- job 18:11
.
"His strength is famished, And calamity is ready at his side. -- job 18:12
.
"His skin is devoured by disease, The firstborn of death devours his limbs. -- job 18:13
.
"He is torn from the security of his tent, And they march him before the king of terrors. -- job 18:14
.
"There dwells in his tent nothing of his; Brimstone is scattered on his habitation. -- job 18:15
.
"His roots are dried below, And his branch is cut off above. -- job 18:16
.
"Memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name abroad. -- job 18:17
.
"He is driven from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world. -- job 18:18
.
"He has no offspring or posterity among his people, Nor any survivor where he sojourned. -- job 18:19
.
"Those in the west are appalled at his fate, And those in the east are seized with horror. -- job 18:20
.
"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God." -- job 18:21
.
Then Job responded, -- job 19:1
.
"How long will you torment me And crush me with words? -- job 19:2
.
"These ten times you have insulted me; You are not ashamed to wrong me. -- job 19:3
.
"Even if I have truly erred, My error lodges with me. -- job 19:4
.
"If indeed you vaunt yourselves against me And prove my disgrace to me, -- job 19:5
.
Know then that God has wronged me And has closed His net around me. -- job 19:6
.
"Behold, I cry, 'Violence!' but I get no answer; I shout for help, but there is no justice. -- job 19:7
.
"He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, And He has put darkness on my paths. -- job 19:8
.
"He has stripped my honor from me And removed the crown from my head. -- job 19:9
.
"He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; And He has uprooted my hope like a tree. -- job 19:10
.
"He has also kindled His anger against me And considered me as His enemy. -- job 19:11
.
"His troops come together, And build up their way against me And camp around my tent. -- job 19:12
.
"He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. -- job 19:13
.
"My relatives have failed, And my intimate friends have forgotten me. -- job 19:14
.
"Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight. -- job 19:15
.
"I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I have to implore him with my mouth. -- job 19:16
.
"My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am loathsome to my own brothers. -- job 19:17
.
"Even young children despise me; I rise up and they speak against me. -- job 19:18
.
"All my associates abhor me, And those I love have turned against me. -- job 19:19
.
"My bone clings to my skin and my flesh, And I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth. -- job 19:20
.
"Pity me, pity me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me. -- job 19:21
.
"Why do you persecute me as God does, And are not satisfied with my flesh? -- job 19:22
.
"Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book! -- job 19:23
.
"That with an iron stylus and lead They were engraved in the rock forever! -- job 19:24
.
"As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at the last He will take His stand on the earth. -- job 19:25
.
"Even after my skin is destroyed, Yet from my flesh I shall see God; -- job 19:26

Whom I myself shall behold, And whom my eyes will see and not another. My heart faints within me! -- job 19:27
.
"If you say, 'How shall we persecute him?' And 'What pretext for a case against him can we find?' -- job 19:28
.
"Then be afraid of the sword for yourselves, For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, So that you may know there is judgment." -- job 19:29
.
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, -- job 20:1
.
"Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond, Even because of my inward agitation. -- job 20:2
.
"I listened to the reproof which insults me, And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer. -- job 20:3
.
"Do you know this from of old, From the establishment of man on earth, -- job 20:4
.
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless momentary? -- job 20:5
.
"Though his loftiness reaches the heavens, And his head touches the clouds, -- job 20:6
.
He perishes forever like his refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' -- job 20:7
.
"He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him; Even like a vision of the night he is chased away. -- job 20:8
.
"The eye which saw him sees him no longer, And his place no longer beholds him. -- job 20:9
.
"His sons favor the poor, And his hands give back his wealth. -- job 20:10
.
"His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it lies down with him in the dust. -- job 20:11
.
"Though evil is sweet in his mouth And he hides it under his tongue, -- job 20:12
.
Though he desires it and will not let it go, But holds it in his mouth, -- job 20:13
.
Yet his food in his stomach is changed To the venom of cobras within him. -- job 20:14
.
"He swallows riches, But will vomit them up; God will expel them from his belly. -- job 20:15
.
"He sucks the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue slays him. -- job 20:16
.
"He does not look at the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and curds. -- job 20:17
.
"He returns what he has attained And cannot swallow it; As to the riches of his trading, He cannot even enjoy them. -- job 20:18
.
"For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; He has seized a house which he has not built. -- job 20:19
.
"Because he knew no quiet within him, He does not retain anything he desires. -- job 20:20
.
"Nothing remains for him to devour, Therefore his prosperity does not endure. -- job 20:21
.
"In the fullness of his plenty he will be cramped; The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him. -- job 20:22
.
"When he fills his belly, God will send His fierce anger on him And will rain it on him while he is eating. -- job 20:23
.
"He may flee from the iron weapon, But the bronze bow will pierce him. -- job 20:24
.
"It is drawn forth and comes out of his back, Even the glittering point from his gall. Terrors come upon him, -- job 20:25
.
Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures, And unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent. -- job 20:26
.
"The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him. -- job 20:27
.
"The increase of his house will depart; His possessions will flow away in the day of His anger. -- job 20:28
.
"This is the wicked man's portion from God, Even the heritage decreed to him by God." -- job 20:29
.
Then Job answered, -- job 21:1
.
"Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your way of consolation. -- job 21:2
.
"Bear with me that I may speak; Then after I have spoken, you may mock. -- job 21:3
.
"As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient? -- job 21:4
.
"Look at me, and be astonished, And put your hand over your mouth. -- job 21:5
.
"Even when I remember, I am disturbed, And horror takes hold of my flesh. -- job 21:6
.
"Why do the wicked still live, Continue on, also become very powerful? -- job 21:7
.
"Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes, -- job 21:8
.
Their houses are safe from fear, And the rod of God is not on them. -- job 21:9
.
"His ox mates without fail; His cow calves and does not abort. -- job 21:10
.
"They send forth their little ones like the flock, And their children skip about. -- job 21:11
.
"They sing to the timbrel and harp And rejoice at the sound of the flute. -- job 21:12
.
"They spend their days in prosperity, And suddenly they go down to Sheol. -- job 21:13
.
"They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways. -- job 21:14
.
'Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, And what would we gain if we entreat Him?' -- job 21:15
.
"Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me. -- job 21:16
.
"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, Or does their calamity fall on them? Does God apportion destruction in His anger? -- job 21:17
.
"Are they as straw before the wind, And like chaff which the storm carries away? -- job 21:18
.
"You say, 'God stores away a man's iniquity for his sons.' Let God repay him so that he may know it. -- job 21:19
.
"Let his own eyes see his decay, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. -- job 21:20
.
"For what does he care for his household after him, When the number of his months is cut off? -- job 21:21
.
"Can anyone teach God knowledge, In that He judges those on high? -- job 21:22
.
"One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and satisfied; -- job 21:23
.
His sides are filled out with fat, And the marrow of his bones is moist, -- job 21:24
.
While another dies with a bitter soul, Never even tasting anything good. -- job 21:25
.
"Together they lie down in the dust, And worms cover them. -- job 21:26
.
"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the plans by which you would wrong me. -- job 21:27
.
"For you say, 'Where is the house of the nobleman, And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?' -- job 21:28
.
"Have you not asked wayfaring men, And do you not recognize their witness? -- job 21:29
.
"For the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity; They will be led forth at the day of fury. -- job 21:30
.
"Who will confront him with his actions, And who will repay him for what he has done? -- job 21:31
.
"While he is carried to the grave, Men will keep watch over his tomb. -- job 21:32
.
"The clods of the valley will gently cover him; Moreover, all men will follow after him, While countless ones go before him. -- job 21:33
.
"How then will you vainly comfort me, For your answers remain full of falsehood?" -- job 21:34
.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, -- job 22:1
.
"Can a vigorous man be of use to God, Or a wise man be useful to himself? -- job 22:2
.
"Is there any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, Or profit if you make your ways perfect? -- job 22:3
.
"Is it because of your reverence that He reproves you, That He enters into judgment against you? -- job 22:4
.
"Is not your wickedness great, And your iniquities without end? -- job 22:5
.
"For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause, And stripped men naked. -- job 22:6
.
"To the weary you have given no water to drink, And from the hungry you have withheld bread. -- job 22:7
.
"But the earth belongs to the mighty man, And the honorable man dwells in it. -- job 22:8
.
"You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the orphans has been crushed. -- job 22:9
.
"Therefore snares surround you, And sudden dread terrifies you, -- job 22:10
.
Or darkness, so that you cannot see, And an abundance of water covers you. -- job 22:11
.
"Is not God in the height of heaven? Look also at the distant stars, how high they are! -- job 22:12
.
"You say, 'What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness? -- job 22:13
.
'Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; And He walks on the vault of heaven.' -- job 22:14
.
"Will you keep to the ancient path Which wicked men have trod, -- job 22:15
.
Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundations were washed away by a river? -- job 22:16
.
"They said to God, 'Depart from us!' And 'What can the Almighty do to them?' -- job 22:17
.
"Yet He filled their houses with good things; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me. -- job 22:18
.
"The righteous see and are glad, And the innocent mock them, -- job 22:19
.
Saying, 'Truly our adversaries are cut off, And their abundance the fire has consumed.' -- job 22:20
.
"Yield now and be at peace with Him; Thereby good will come to you. -- job 22:21
.
"Please receive instruction from His mouth And establish His words in your heart. -- job 22:22
.
"If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored; If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent, -- job 22:23
.
And place your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks, -- job 22:24
.
Then the Almighty will be your gold And choice silver to you. -- job 22:25
.
"For then you will delight in the Almighty And lift up your face to God. -- job 22:26
.
"You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; And you will pay your vows. -- job 22:27
.
"You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And light will shine on your ways. -- job 22:28
.
"When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence, And the humble person He will save. -- job 22:29
.
"He will deliver one who is not innocent, And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands." -- job 22:30
.
Then Job replied, -- job 23:1
.
"Even today my complaint is rebellion; His hand is heavy despite my groaning. -- job 23:2
.
"Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat! -- job 23:3
.
"I would present my case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments. -- job 23:4
.
"I would learn the words which He would answer, And perceive what He would say to me. -- job 23:5
.
"Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power? No, surely He would pay attention to me. -- job 23:6
.
"There the upright would reason with Him; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge. -- job 23:7
.
"Behold, I go forward but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him; -- job 23:8
.
When He acts on the left, I cannot behold Him; He turns on the right, I cannot see Him. -- job 23:9
.
"But He knows the way I take; When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold. -- job 23:10
.
"My foot has held fast to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside. -- job 23:11
.
"I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food. -- job 23:12
.
"But He is unique and who can turn Him? And what His soul desires, that He does. -- job 23:13
.
"For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such decrees are with Him. -- job 23:14
.
"Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; When I consider, I am terrified of Him. -- job 23:15
.
"It is God who has made my heart faint, And the Almighty who has dismayed me, -- job 23:16
.
But I am not silenced by the darkness, Nor deep gloom which covers me. -- job 23:17
.
"Why are times not stored up by the Almighty, And why do those who know Him not see His days? -- job 24:1
.
"Some remove the landmarks; They seize and devour flocks. -- job 24:2
.
"They drive away the donkeys of the orphans; They take the widow's ox for a pledge. -- job 24:3
.
"They push the needy aside from the road; The poor of the land are made to hide themselves altogether. -- job 24:4
.
"Behold, as wild donkeys in the wilderness They go forth seeking food in their activity, As bread for their children in the desert. -- job 24:5
.
"They harvest their fodder in the field And glean the vineyard of the wicked. -- job 24:6
.
"They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering against the cold. -- job 24:7
.
"They are wet with the mountain rains And hug the rock for want of a shelter. -- job 24:8
.
"Others snatch the orphan from the breast, And against the poor they take a pledge. -- job 24:9
.
"They cause the poor to go about naked without clothing, And they take away the sheaves from the hungry. -- job 24:10
.
"Within the walls they produce oil; They tread wine presses but thirst. -- job 24:11
.
"From the city men groan, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not pay attention to folly. -- job 24:12
.
"Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways Nor abide in its paths. -- job 24:13
.
"The murderer arises at dawn; He kills the poor and the needy, And at night he is as a thief. -- job 24:14
.
"The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, 'No eye will see me.' And he disguises his face. -- job 24:15
.
"In the dark they dig into houses, They shut themselves up by day; They do not know the light. -- job 24:16
.
"For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness, For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness. -- job 24:17
.
"They are insignificant on the surface of the water; Their portion is cursed on the earth. They do not turn toward the vineyards. -- job 24:18
.
"Drought and heat consume the snow waters, So does Sheol those who have sinned. -- job 24:19
.
"A mother will forget him; The worm feeds sweetly till he is no longer remembered. And wickedness will be broken like a tree. -- job 24:20
.
"He wrongs the barren woman And does no good for the widow. -- job 24:21
.
"But He drags off the valiant by His power; He rises, but no one has assurance of life. -- job 24:22
.
"He provides them with security, and they are supported; And His eyes are on their ways. -- job 24:23
.
"They are exalted a little while, then they are gone; Moreover, they are brought low and like everything gathered up; Even like the heads of grain they are cut off. -- job 24:24
.
"Now if it is not so, who can prove me a liar, And make my speech worthless?" -- job 24:25
.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, -- job 25:1
.
"Dominion and awe belong to Him Who establishes peace in His heights. -- job 25:2
.
"Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise? -- job 25:3
.
"How then can a man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman? -- job 25:4
.
"If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight, -- job 25:5
.
How much less man, that maggot, And the son of man, that worm!" -- job 25:6
.
Then Job responded, -- job 26:1
.
"What a help you are to the weak! How you have saved the arm without strength! -- job 26:2
.
"What counsel you have given to one without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided! -- job 26:3
.
"To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit was expressed through you? -- job 26:4
.
"The departed spirits tremble Under the waters and their inhabitants. -- job 26:5
.
"Naked is Sheol before Him, And Abaddon has no covering. -- job 26:6
.
"He stretches out the north over empty space And hangs the earth on nothing. -- job 26:7
.
"He wraps up the waters in His clouds, And the cloud does not burst under them. -- job 26:8
.
"He obscures the face of the full moon And spreads His cloud over it. -- job 26:9
.
"He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness. -- job 26:10
.
"The pillars of heaven tremble And are amazed at His rebuke. -- job 26:11
.
"He quieted the sea with His power, And by His understanding He shattered Rahab. -- job 26:12
.
"By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent. -- job 26:13
.
"Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?" -- job 26:14
.
Then Job continued his discourse and said, -- job 27:1
.
"As God lives, who has taken away my right, And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul, -- job 27:2
.
For as long as life is in me, And the breath of God is in my nostrils, -- job 27:3
.
My lips certainly will not speak unjustly, Nor will my tongue mutter deceit. -- job 27:4
.
"Far be it from me that I should declare you right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me. -- job 27:5
.
"I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go. My heart does not reproach any of my days. -- job 27:6
.
"May my enemy be as the wicked And my opponent as the unjust. -- job 27:7
.
"For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, When God requires his life? -- job 27:8
.
"Will God hear his cry When distress comes upon him? -- job 27:9
.
"Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times? -- job 27:10
.
"I will instruct you in the power of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal. -- job 27:11
.
"Behold, all of you have seen it; Why then do you act foolishly? -- job 27:12
.
"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the inheritance which tyrants receive from the Almighty. -- job 27:13
.
"Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread. -- job 27:14
.
"His survivors will be buried because of the plague, And their widows will not be able to weep. -- job 27:15
.
"Though he piles up silver like dust And prepares garments as plentiful as the clay, -- job 27:16
.
He may prepare it, but the just will wear it And the innocent will divide the silver. -- job 27:17
.
"He has built his house like the spider's web, Or as a hut which the watchman has made. -- job 27:18
.
"He lies down rich, but never again; He opens his eyes, and it is no longer. -- job 27:19
.
"Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night. -- job 27:20
.
"The east wind carries him away, and he is gone, For it whirls him away from his place. -- job 27:21
.
"For it will hurl at him without sparing; He will surely try to flee from its power. -- job 27:22
.
"Men will clap their hands at him And will hiss him from his place. -- job 27:23
.
"Surely there is a mine for silver And a place where they refine gold. -- job 28:1
.
"Iron is taken from the dust, And copper is smelted from rock. -- job 28:2
.
"Man puts an end to darkness, And to the farthest limit he searches out The rock in gloom and deep shadow. -- job 28:3
.
"He sinks a shaft far from habitation, Forgotten by the foot; They hang and swing to and fro far from men. -- job 28:4
.
"The earth, from it comes food, And underneath it is turned up as fire. -- job 28:5
.
"Its rocks are the source of sapphires, And its dust contains gold. -- job 28:6
.
"The path no bird of prey knows, Nor has the falcon's eye caught sight of it. -- job 28:7
.
"The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed over it. -- job 28:8
.
"He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the base. -- job 28:9
.
"He hews out channels through the rocks, And his eye sees anything precious. -- job 28:10
.
"He dams up the streams from flowing, And what is hidden he brings out to the light. -- job 28:11
.
"But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? -- job 28:12
.
"Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living. -- job 28:13
.
"The deep says, 'It is not in me'; And the sea says, 'It is not with me.' -- job 28:14
.
"Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, Nor can silver be weighed as its price. -- job 28:15
.
"It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx, or sapphire. -- job 28:16
.
"Gold or glass cannot equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold. -- job 28:17
.
"Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned; And the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls. -- job 28:18
.
"The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold. -- job 28:19
.
"Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding? -- job 28:20
.
"Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all living And concealed from the birds of the sky. -- job 28:21
.
"Abaddon and Death say, 'With our ears we have heard a report of it.' -- job 28:22
.
"God understands its way, And He knows its place. -- job 28:23
.
"For He looks to the ends of the earth And sees everything under the heavens. -- job 28:24
.
"When He imparted weight to the wind And meted out the waters by measure, -- job 28:25
.
When He set a limit for the rain And a course for the thunderbolt, -- job 28:26
.
Then He saw it and declared it; He established it and also searched it out. -- job 28:27
.
"And to man He said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.'" -- job 28:28
.
And Job again took up his discourse and said, -- job 29:1
.
"Oh that I were as in months gone by, As in the days when God watched over me; -- job 29:2
.
When His lamp shone over my head, And by His light I walked through darkness; -- job 29:3
.
As I was in the prime of my days, When the friendship of God was over my tent; -- job 29:4
.
When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were around me; -- job 29:5
.
When my steps were bathed in butter, And the rock poured out for me streams of oil! -- job 29:6
.
"When I went out to the gate of the city, When I took my seat in the square, -- job 29:7
.
The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the old men arose and stood. -- job 29:8
.
"The princes stopped talking And put their hands on their mouths; -- job 29:9
.
The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to their palate. -- job 29:10
.
"For when the ear heard, it called me blessed, And when the eye saw, it gave witness of me, -- job 29:11
.
Because I delivered the poor who cried for help, And the orphan who had no helper. -- job 29:12
.
"The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me, And I made the widow's heart sing for joy. -- job 29:13
.
"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban. -- job 29:14
.
"I was eyes to the blind And feet to the lame. -- job 29:15
.
"I was a father to the needy, And I investigated the case which I did not know. -- job 29:16
.
"I broke the jaws of the wicked And snatched the prey from his teeth. -- job 29:17
.
"Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand. -- job 29:18
.
'My root is spread out to the waters, And dew lies all night on my branch. -- job 29:19
.
'My glory is ever new with me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.' -- job 29:20
.
"To me they listened and waited, And kept silent for my counsel. -- job 29:21
.
"After my words they did not speak again, And my speech dropped on them. -- job 29:22
.
"They waited for me as for the rain, And opened their mouth as for the spring rain. -- job 29:23
.
"I smiled on them when they did not believe, And the light of my face they did not cast down. -- job 29:24
.
"I chose a way for them and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king among the troops, As one who comforted the mourners. -- job 29:25
.
"But now those younger than I mock me, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock. -- job 30:1
.
"Indeed, what good was the strength of their hands to me? Vigor had perished from them. -- job 30:2
.
"From want and famine they are gaunt Who gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation, -- job 30:3
.
Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And whose food is the root of the broom shrub. -- job 30:4
.
"They are driven from the community; They shout against them as against a thief, -- job 30:5
.
So that they dwell in dreadful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks. -- job 30:6
.
"Among the bushes they cry out; Under the nettles they are gathered together. -- job 30:7
.
"Fools, even those without a name, They were scourged from the land. -- job 30:8
.
"And now I have become their taunt, I have even become a byword to them. -- job 30:9
.
"They abhor me and stand aloof from me, And they do not refrain from spitting at my face. -- job 30:10
.
"Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off the bridle before me. -- job 30:11
.
"On the right hand their brood arises; They thrust aside my feet and build up against me their ways of destruction. -- job 30:12
.
"They break up my path, They profit from my destruction; No one restrains them. -- job 30:13
.
"As through a wide breach they come, Amid the tempest they roll on. -- job 30:14
.
"Terrors are turned against me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud. -- job 30:15
.
"And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have seized me. -- job 30:16
.
"At night it pierces my bones within me, And my gnawing pains take no rest. -- job 30:17
.
"By a great force my garment is distorted; It binds me about as the collar of my coat. -- job 30:18
.
"He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes. -- job 30:19
.
"I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You turn Your attention against me. -- job 30:20
.
"You have become cruel to me; With the might of Your hand You persecute me. -- job 30:21
.
"You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride; And You dissolve me in a storm. -- job 30:22
.
"For I know that You will bring me to death And to the house of meeting for all living. -- job 30:23
.
"Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, Or in his disaster therefore cry out for help? -- job 30:24
.
"Have I not wept for the one whose life is hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy? -- job 30:25
.
"When I expected good, then evil came; When I waited for light, then darkness came. -- job 30:26
.
"I am seething within and cannot relax; Days of affliction confront me. -- job 30:27
.
"I go about mourning without comfort; I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help. -- job 30:28
.
"I have become a brother to jackals And a companion of ostriches. -- job 30:29
.
"My skin turns black on me, And my bones burn with fever. -- job 30:30
.
"Therefore my harp is turned to mourning, And my flute to the sound of those who weep. -- job 30:31
.
"I have made a covenant with my eyes; How then could I gaze at a virgin? -- job 31:1
.
"And what is the portion of God from above Or the heritage of the Almighty from on high? -- job 31:2
.
"Is it not calamity to the unjust And disaster to those who work iniquity? -- job 31:3
.
"Does He not see my ways And number all my steps? -- job 31:4
.
"If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot has hastened after deceit, -- job 31:5
.
Let Him weigh me with accurate scales, And let God know my integrity. -- job 31:6
.
"If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart followed my eyes, Or if any spot has stuck to my hands, -- job 31:7
.
Let me sow and another eat, And let my crops be uprooted. -- job 31:8
.
"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or I have lurked at my neighbor's doorway, -- job 31:9
.
May my wife grind for another, And let others kneel down over her. -- job 31:10
.
"For that would be a lustful crime; Moreover, it would be an iniquity punishable by judges. -- job 31:11
.
"For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon, And would uproot all my increase. -- job 31:12
.
"If I have despised the claim of my male or female slaves When they filed a complaint against me, -- job 31:13
.
What then could I do when God arises? And when He calls me to account, what will I answer Him? -- job 31:14
.
"Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb? -- job 31:15
.
"If I have kept the poor from their desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, -- job 31:16
.
Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the orphan has not shared it -- job 31:17
.
(But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And from infancy I guided her), -- job 31:18
.
If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering, -- job 31:19
.
If his loins have not thanked me, And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep, -- job 31:20
.
If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan, Because I saw I had support in the gate, -- job 31:21
.
Let my shoulder fall from the socket, And my arm be broken off at the elbow. -- job 31:22
.
"For calamity from God is a terror to me, And because of His majesty I can do nothing. -- job 31:23
.
"If I have put my confidence in gold, And called fine gold my trust, -- job 31:24
.
If I have gloated because my wealth was great, And because my hand had secured so much; -- job 31:25
.
If I have looked at the sun when it shone Or the moon going in splendor, -- job 31:26
.
And my heart became secretly enticed, And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, -- job 31:27
.
That too would have been an iniquity calling for judgment, For I would have denied God above. -- job 31:28
.
"Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy, Or exulted when evil befell him? -- job 31:29
.
"No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for his life in a curse. -- job 31:30
.
"Have the men of my tent not said, 'Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his meat'? -- job 31:31
.
"The alien has not lodged outside, For I have opened my doors to the traveler. -- job 31:32
.
"Have I covered my transgressions like Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom, -- job 31:33
.
Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, And kept silent and did not go out of doors? -- job 31:34
.
"Oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature; Let the Almighty answer me! And the indictment which my adversary has written, -- job 31:35
.
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, I would bind it to myself like a crown. -- job 31:36
.
"I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him. -- job 31:37
.
"If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together; -- job 31:38
.
If I have eaten its fruit without money, Or have caused its owners to lose their lives, -- job 31:39
.
Let briars grow instead of wheat, And stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended. -- job 31:40
.
Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. -- job 32:1
.
But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned because he justified himself before God. -- job 32:2
.
And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. -- job 32:3
.
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he. -- job 32:4
.
And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned. -- job 32:5
.
So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said, "I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think. -- job 32:6
.
"I thought age should speak, And increased years should teach wisdom. -- job 32:7
.
"But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding. -- job 32:8
.
"The abundant in years may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice. -- job 32:9
.
"So I say, 'Listen to me, I too will tell what I think.' -- job 32:10
.
"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, While you pondered what to say. -- job 32:11
.
"I even paid close attention to you; Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words. -- job 32:12
.
"Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God will rout him, not man.' -- job 32:13
.
"For he has not arranged his words against me, Nor will I reply to him with your arguments. -- job 32:14
.
"They are dismayed, they no longer answer; Words have failed them. -- job 32:15
.
"Shall I wait, because they do not speak, Because they stop and no longer answer? -- job 32:16
.
"I too will answer my share, I also will tell my opinion. -- job 32:17
.
"For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me. -- job 32:18
.
"Behold, my belly is like unvented wine, Like new wineskins it is about to burst. -- job 32:19
.
"Let me speak that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer. -- job 32:20
.
"Let me now be partial to no one, Nor flatter any man. -- job 32:21
.
"For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away. -- job 32:22
.
"However now, Job, please hear my speech, And listen to all my words. -- job 33:1
.
"Behold now, I open my mouth, My tongue in my mouth speaks. -- job 33:2
.
"My words are from the uprightness of my heart, And my lips speak knowledge sincerely. -- job 33:3
.
"The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life. -- job 33:4
.
"Refute me if you can; Array yourselves before me, take your stand. -- job 33:5
.
"Behold, I belong to God like you; I too have been formed out of the clay. -- job 33:6
.
"Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, Nor should my pressure weigh heavily on you. -- job 33:7
.
"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words: -- job 33:8
.
'I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent and there is no guilt in me. -- job 33:9
.
'Behold, He invents pretexts against me; He counts me as His enemy. -- job 33:10
.
'He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches all my paths.' -- job 33:11
.
"Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, For God is greater than man. -- job 33:12
.
"Why do you complain against Him That He does not give an account of all His doings? -- job 33:13
.
"Indeed God speaks once, Or twice, yet no one notices it. -- job 33:14
.
"In a dream, a vision of the night, When sound sleep falls on men, While they slumber in their beds, -- job 33:15
.
Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction, -- job 33:16
.
That He may turn man aside from his conduct, And keep man from pride; -- job 33:17
.
He keeps back his soul from the pit, And his life from passing over into Sheol. -- job 33:18
.
"Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with unceasing complaint in his bones; -- job 33:19
.
So that his life loathes bread, And his soul favorite food. -- job 33:20
.
"His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones which were not seen stick out. -- job 33:21
.
"Then his soul draws near to the pit, And his life to those who bring death. -- job 33:22
.
"If there is an angel as mediator for him, One out of a thousand, To remind a man what is right for him, -- job 33:23
.
Then let him be gracious to him, and say, 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom'; -- job 33:24
.
Let his flesh become fresher than in youth, Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor; -- job 33:25
.
Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him, That he may see His face with joy, And He may restore His righteousness to man. -- job 33:26
.
"He will sing to men and say, 'I have sinned and perverted what is right, And it is not proper for me. -- job 33:27
.
'He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit, And my life shall see the light.' -- job 33:28
.
"Behold, God does all these oftentimes with men, -- job 33:29
.
To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life. -- job 33:30
.
"Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; Keep silent, and let me speak. -- job 33:31
.
"Then if you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you. -- job 33:32
.
"If not, listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom." -- job 33:33
.
Then Elihu continued and said, -- job 34:1
.
"Hear my words, you wise men, And listen to me, you who know. -- job 34:2
.
"For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food. -- job 34:3
.
"Let us choose for ourselves what is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good. -- job 34:4
.
"For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my right; -- job 34:5
.
Should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.' -- job 34:6
.
"What man is like Job, Who drinks up derision like water, -- job 34:7
.
Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men? -- job 34:8
.
"For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing When he is pleased with God.' -- job 34:9
.
"Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to do wrong. -- job 34:10
.
"For He pays a man according to his work, And makes him find it according to his way. -- job 34:11
.
"Surely, God will not act wickedly, And the Almighty will not pervert justice. -- job 34:12
.
"Who gave Him authority over the earth? And who has laid on Him the whole world? -- job 34:13
.
"If He should determine to do so, If He should gather to Himself His spirit and His breath, -- job 34:14
.
All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust. -- job 34:15
.
"But if you have understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words. -- job 34:16
.
"Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn the righteous mighty One, -- job 34:17
.
Who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' To nobles, 'Wicked ones'; -- job 34:18
.
Who shows no partiality to princes Nor regards the rich above the poor, For they all are the work of His hands? -- job 34:19
.
"In a moment they die, and at midnight People are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without a hand. -- job 34:20
.
"For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps. -- job 34:21
.
"There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. -- job 34:22
.
"For He does not need to consider a man further, That he should go before God in judgment. -- job 34:23
.
"He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place. -- job 34:24
.
"Therefore He knows their works, And He overthrows them in the night, And they are crushed. -- job 34:25
.
"He strikes them like the wicked In a public place, -- job 34:26
.
Because they turned aside from following Him, And had no regard for any of His ways; -- job 34:27
.
So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And that He might hear the cry of the afflicted-- -- job 34:28
.
When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him, That is, in regard to both nation and man?-- -- job 34:29
.
So that godless men would not rule Nor be snares of the people. -- job 34:30
.
"For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne chastisement; I will not offend anymore; -- job 34:31
.
Teach me what I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will not do it again'? -- job 34:32
.
"Shall He recompense on your terms, because you have rejected it? For you must choose, and not I; Therefore declare what you know. -- job 34:33
.
"Men of understanding will say to me, And a wise man who hears me, -- job 34:34
.
'Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom. -- job 34:35
.
'Job ought to be tried to the limit, Because he answers like wicked men. -- job 34:36
.
'For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.'" -- job 34:37
.
Then Elihu continued and said, -- job 35:1
.
"Do you think this is according to justice? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'? -- job 35:2
.
"For you say, 'What advantage will it be to You? What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?' -- job 35:3
.
"I will answer you, And your friends with you. -- job 35:4
.
"Look at the heavens and see; And behold the clouds--they are higher than you. -- job 35:5
.
"If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him? And if your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him? -- job 35:6
.
"If you are righteous, what do you give to Him, Or what does He receive from your hand? -- job 35:7
.
"Your wickedness is for a man like yourself, And your righteousness is for a son of man. -- job 35:8
.
"Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty. -- job 35:9
.
"But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night, -- job 35:10
.
Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?' -- job 35:11
.
"There they cry out, but He does not answer Because of the pride of evil men. -- job 35:12
.
"Surely God will not listen to an empty cry, Nor will the Almighty regard it. -- job 35:13
.
"How much less when you say you do not behold Him, The case is before Him, and you must wait for Him! -- job 35:14
.
"And now, because He has not visited in His anger, Nor has He acknowledged transgression well, -- job 35:15
.
So Job opens his mouth emptily; He multiplies words without knowledge." -- job 35:16
.
Then Elihu continued and said, -- job 36:1
.
"Wait for me a little, and I will show you That there is yet more to be said in God's behalf. -- job 36:2
.
"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. -- job 36:3
.
"For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. -- job 36:4
.
"Behold, God is mighty but does not despise any; He is mighty in strength of understanding. -- job 36:5
.
"He does not keep the wicked alive, But gives justice to the afflicted. -- job 36:6
.
"He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But with kings on the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted. -- job 36:7
.
"And if they are bound in fetters, And are caught in the cords of affliction, -- job 36:8
.
Then He declares to them their work And their transgressions, that they have magnified themselves. -- job 36:9
.
"He opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they return from evil. -- job 36:10
.
"If they hear and serve Him, They will end their days in prosperity And their years in pleasures. -- job 36:11
.
"But if they do not hear, they shall perish by the sword And they will die without knowledge. -- job 36:12
.
"But the godless in heart lay up anger; They do not cry for help when He binds them. -- job 36:13
.
"They die in youth, And their life perishes among the cult prostitutes. -- job 36:14
.
"He delivers the afflicted in their affliction, And opens their ear in time of oppression. -- job 36:15
.
"Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress, Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness. -- job 36:16
.
"But you were full of judgment on the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you. -- job 36:17
.
"Beware that wrath does not entice you to scoffing; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside. -- job 36:18
.
"Will your riches keep you from distress, Or all the forces of your strength? -- job 36:19
.
"Do not long for the night, When people vanish in their place. -- job 36:20
.
"Be careful, do not turn to evil, For you have preferred this to affliction. -- job 36:21
.
"Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a teacher like Him? -- job 36:22
.
"Who has appointed Him His way, And who has said, 'You have done wrong'? -- job 36:23
.
"Remember that you should exalt His work, Of which men have sung. -- job 36:24
.
"All men have seen it; Man beholds from afar. -- job 36:25
.
"Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; The number of His years is unsearchable. -- job 36:26
.
"For He draws up the drops of water, They distill rain from the mist, -- job 36:27
.
Which the clouds pour down, They drip upon man abundantly. -- job 36:28
.
"Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, The thundering of His pavilion? -- job 36:29
.
"Behold, He spreads His lightning about Him, And He covers the depths of the sea. -- job 36:30
.
"For by these He judges peoples; He gives food in abundance. -- job 36:31
.
"He covers His hands with the lightning, And commands it to strike the mark. -- job 36:32
.
"Its noise declares His presence; The cattle also, concerning what is coming up. -- job 36:33
.
"At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place. -- job 37:1
.
"Listen closely to the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth. -- job 37:2
.
"Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, And His lightning to the ends of the earth. -- job 37:3
.
"After it, a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain the lightnings when His voice is heard. -- job 37:4
.
"God thunders with His voice wondrously, Doing great things which we cannot comprehend. -- job 37:5
.
"For to the snow He says, 'Fall on the earth,' And to the downpour and the rain, 'Be strong.' -- job 37:6
.
"He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work. -- job 37:7
.
"Then the beast goes into its lair And remains in its den. -- job 37:8
.
"Out of the south comes the storm, And out of the north the cold. -- job 37:9
.
"From the breath of God ice is made, And the expanse of the waters is frozen. -- job 37:10
.
"Also with moisture He loads the thick cloud; He disperses the cloud of His lightning. -- job 37:11
.
"It changes direction, turning around by His guidance, That it may do whatever He commands it On the face of the inhabited earth. -- job 37:12
.
"Whether for correction, or for His world, Or for lovingkindness, He causes it to happen. -- job 37:13
.
"Listen to this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God. -- job 37:14
.
"Do you know how God establishes them, And makes the lightning of His cloud to shine? -- job 37:15
.
"Do you know about the layers of the thick clouds, The wonders of one perfect in knowledge, -- job 37:16
.
You whose garments are hot, When the land is still because of the south wind? -- job 37:17
.
"Can you, with Him, spread out the skies, Strong as a molten mirror? -- job 37:18
.
"Teach us what we shall say to Him; We cannot arrange our case because of darkness. -- job 37:19
.
"Shall it be told Him that I would speak? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up? -- job 37:20
.
"Now men do not see the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind has passed and cleared them. -- job 37:21
.
"Out of the north comes golden splendor; Around God is awesome majesty. -- job 37:22
.
"The Almighty--we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power And He will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness. -- job 37:23
.
"Therefore men fear Him; He does not regard any who are wise of heart." -- job 37:24
.
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, -- job 38:1
.
"Who is this that darkens counsel By words without knowledge? -- job 38:2
.
"Now gird up your loins like a man, And I will ask you, and you instruct Me! -- job 38:3
.
"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding, -- job 38:4
.
Who set its measurements? Since you know. Or who stretched the line on it? -- job 38:5
.
"On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone, -- job 38:6
.
When the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy? -- job 38:7
.
"Or who enclosed the sea with doors When, bursting forth, it went out from the womb; -- job 38:8
.
When I made a cloud its garment And thick darkness its swaddling band, -- job 38:9
.
And I placed boundaries on it And set a bolt and doors, -- job 38:10
.
And I said, 'Thus far you shall come, but no farther; And here shall your proud waves stop'? -- job 38:11
.
"Have you ever in your life commanded the morning, And caused the dawn to know its place, -- job 38:12
.
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it? -- job 38:13
.
"It is changed like clay under the seal; And they stand forth like a garment. -- job 38:14
.
"From the wicked their light is withheld, And the uplifted arm is broken. -- job 38:15
.
"Have you entered into the springs of the sea Or walked in the recesses of the deep? -- job 38:16
.
"Have the gates of death been revealed to you, Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness? -- job 38:17
.
"Have you understood the expanse of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this. -- job 38:18
.
"Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place, -- job 38:19
.
That you may take it to its territory And that you may discern the paths to its home? -- job 38:20
.
"You know, for you were born then, And the number of your days is great! -- job 38:21
.
"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail, -- job 38:22
.
Which I have reserved for the time of distress, For the day of war and battle? -- job 38:23
.
"Where is the way that the light is divided, Or the east wind scattered on the earth? -- job 38:24
.
"Who has cleft a channel for the flood, Or a way for the thunderbolt, -- job 38:25
.
To bring rain on a land without people, On a desert without a man in it, -- job 38:26
.
To satisfy the waste and desolate land And to make the seeds of grass to sprout? -- job 38:27
.
"Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew? -- job 38:28
.
"From whose womb has come the ice? And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth? -- job 38:29
.
"Water becomes hard like stone, And the surface of the deep is imprisoned. -- job 38:30
.
"Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the cords of Orion? -- job 38:31
.
"Can you lead forth a constellation in its season, And guide the Bear with her satellites? -- job 38:32
.
"Do you know the ordinances of the heavens, Or fix their rule over the earth? -- job 38:33
.
"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, So that an abundance of water will cover you? -- job 38:34
.
"Can you send forth lightnings that they may go And say to you, 'Here we are'? -- job 38:35
.
"Who has put wisdom in the innermost being Or given understanding to the mind? -- job 38:36
.
"Who can count the clouds by wisdom, Or tip the water jars of the heavens, -- job 38:37
.
When the dust hardens into a mass And the clods stick together? -- job 38:38
.
"Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, -- job 38:39
.
When they crouch in their dens And lie in wait in their lair? -- job 38:40
.
"Who prepares for the raven its nourishment When its young cry to God And wander about without food? -- job 38:41
.
"Do you know the time the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the deer? -- job 39:1
.
"Can you count the months they fulfill, Or do you know the time they give birth? -- job 39:2
.
"They kneel down, they bring forth their young, They get rid of their labor pains. -- job 39:3
.
"Their offspring become strong, they grow up in the open field; They leave and do not return to them. -- job 39:4
.
"Who sent out the wild donkey free? And who loosed the bonds of the swift donkey, -- job 39:5
.
To whom I gave the wilderness for a home And the salt land for his dwelling place? -- job 39:6
.
"He scorns the tumult of the city, The shoutings of the driver he does not hear. -- job 39:7
.
"He explores the mountains for his pasture And searches after every green thing. -- job 39:8
.
"Will the wild ox consent to serve you, Or will he spend the night at your manger? -- job 39:9
.
"Can you bind the wild ox in a furrow with ropes, Or will he harrow the valleys after you? -- job 39:10
.
"Will you trust him because his strength is great And leave your labor to him? -- job 39:11
.
"Will you have faith in him that he will return your grain And gather it from your threshing floor? -- job 39:12
.
"The ostriches' wings flap joyously With the pinion and plumage of love, -- job 39:13
.
For she abandons her eggs to the earth And warms them in the dust, -- job 39:14
.
And she forgets that a foot may crush them, Or that a wild beast may trample them. -- job 39:15
.
"She treats her young cruelly, as if they were not hers; Though her labor be in vain, she is unconcerned; -- job 39:16
.
Because God has made her forget wisdom, And has not given her a share of understanding. -- job 39:17
.
"When she lifts herself on high, She laughs at the horse and his rider. -- job 39:18
.
"Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane? -- job 39:19
.
"Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrible. -- job 39:20
.
"He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; He goes out to meet the weapons. -- job 39:21
.
"He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; And he does not turn back from the sword. -- job 39:22
.
"The quiver rattles against him, The flashing spear and javelin. -- job 39:23
.
"With shaking and rage he races over the ground, And he does not stand still at the voice of the trumpet. -- job 39:24
.
"As often as the trumpet sounds he says, 'Aha!' And he scents the battle from afar, And the thunder of the captains and the war cry. -- job 39:25
.
"Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, Stretching his wings toward the south? -- job 39:26
.
"Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up And makes his nest on high? -- job 39:27

.
"His young ones also suck up blood; And where the slain are, there is he." -- job 39:30
.
Then the LORD said to Job, -- job 40:1
.
"Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who reproves God answer it." -- job 40:2
.
Then Job answered the LORD and said, -- job 40:3
.
"Behold, I am insignificant; what can I reply to You? I lay my hand on my mouth. -- job 40:4
.
"Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; Even twice, and I will add nothing more." -- job 40:5
.
Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm and said, -- job 40:6
.
"Now gird up your loins like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me. -- job 40:7
.
"Will you really annul My judgment? Will you condemn Me that you may be justified? -- job 40:8
.
"Or do you have an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like His? -- job 40:9
.
"Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity, And clothe yourself with honor and majesty. -- job 40:10
.
"Pour out the overflowings of your anger, And look on everyone who is proud, and make him low. -- job 40:11
.
"Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, And tread down the wicked where they stand. -- job 40:12
.
"Hide them in the dust together; Bind them in the hidden place. -- job 40:13
.
"Then I will also confess to you, That your own right hand can save you. -- job 40:14
.
"Behold now, Behemoth, which I made as well as you; He eats grass like an ox. -- job 40:15
.
"Behold now, his strength in his loins And his power in the muscles of his belly. -- job 40:16
.
"He bends his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together. -- job 40:17
.
"His bones are tubes of bronze; His limbs are like bars of iron. -- job 40:18
.
"He is the first of the ways of God; Let his maker bring near his sword. -- job 40:19
.
"Surely the mountains bring him food, And all the beasts of the field play there. -- job 40:20
.
"Under the lotus plants he lies down, In the covert of the reeds and the marsh. -- job 40:21
.
"The lotus plants cover him with shade; The willows of the brook surround him. -- job 40:22
.
"If a river rages, he is not alarmed; He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth. -- job 40:23
.
"Can anyone capture him when he is on watch, With barbs can anyone pierce his nose? -- job 40:24
.
"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? -- job 41:1
.
"Can you put a rope in his nose Or pierce his jaw with a hook? -- job 41:2
.
"Will he make many supplications to you, Or will he speak to you soft words? -- job 41:3
.
"Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him for a servant forever? -- job 41:4
.
"Will you play with him as with a bird, Or will you bind him for your maidens? -- job 41:5
.
"Will the traders bargain over him? Will they divide him among the merchants? -- job 41:6
.
"Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears? -- job 41:7
.
"Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle; you will not do it again! -- job 41:8
.
"Behold, your expectation is false; Will you be laid low even at the sight of him? -- job 41:9
.
"No one is so fierce that he dares to arouse him; Who then is he that can stand before Me? -- job 41:10
.
"Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is Mine. -- job 41:11
.
"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Or his mighty strength, or his orderly frame. -- job 41:12
.
"Who can strip off his outer armor? Who can come within his double mail? -- job 41:13
.
"Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth there is terror. -- job 41:14
.
"His strong scales are his pride, Shut up as with a tight seal. -- job 41:15
.
"One is so near to another That no air can come between them. -- job 41:16
.
"They are joined one to another; They clasp each other and cannot be separated. -- job 41:17
.
"His sneezes flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. -- job 41:18
.
"Out of his mouth go burning torches; Sparks of fire leap forth. -- job 41:19
.
"Out of his nostrils smoke goes forth As from a boiling pot and burning rushes. -- job 41:20
.
"His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes forth from his mouth. -- job 41:21
.
"In his neck lodges strength, And dismay leaps before him. -- job 41:22
.
"The folds of his flesh are joined together, Firm on him and immovable. -- job 41:23
.
"His heart is as hard as a stone, Even as hard as a lower millstone. -- job 41:24
.
"When he raises himself up, the mighty fear; Because of the crashing they are bewildered. -- job 41:25
.
"The sword that reaches him cannot avail, Nor the spear, the dart or the javelin. -- job 41:26
.
"He regards iron as straw, Bronze as rotten wood. -- job 41:27
.
"The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are turned into stubble for him. -- job 41:28
.
"Clubs are regarded as stubble; He laughs at the rattling of the javelin. -- job 41:29
.
"His underparts are like sharp potsherds; He spreads out like a threshing sledge on the mire. -- job 41:30
.
"He makes the depths boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a jar of ointment. -- job 41:31
.
"Behind him he makes a wake to shine; One would think the deep to be gray-haired. -- job 41:32
.
"Nothing on earth is like him, One made without fear. -- job 41:33
.
"He looks on everything that is high; He is king over all the sons of pride." -- job 41:34
.
Then Job answered the LORD and said, -- job 42:1
.
"I know that You can do all things, And that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted. -- job 42:2
.
'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' "Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know." -- job 42:3
.
'Hear, now, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You instruct me.' -- job 42:4
.
"I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees You; -- job 42:5
.
Therefore I retract, And I repent in dust and ashes." -- job 42:6
.
It came about after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you have not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has. -- job 42:7
.
"Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will accept him so that I may not do with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has." -- job 42:8
.
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job. -- job 42:9
.
The LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD increased all that Job had twofold. -- job 42:10
.
Then all his brothers and all his sisters and all who had known him before came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversities that the LORD had brought on him. And each one gave him one piece of money, and each a ring of gold. -- job 42:11
.
The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had 14,sheep and 6,000 camels and 1,000 yoke of oxen and 1,000 female donkeys. -- job 42:12
.
He had seven sons and three daughters. -- job 42:13
.
He named the first Jemimah, and the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. -- job 42:14
.
In all the land no women were found so fair as Job's daughters; and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers. -- job 42:15
.
After this, Job lived years, and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations. -- job 42:16
.
And Job died, an old man and full of days. -- job 42:17
.
How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers! -- psalms 1:1
.
But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. -- psalms 1:2
.
He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers. -- psalms 1:3
.
The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind drives away. -- psalms 1:4
.
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. -- psalms 1:5
.
For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish. -- psalms 1:6
.
Why are the nations in an uproar And the peoples devising a vain thing? -- psalms 2:1
.
The kings of the earth take their stand And the rulers take counsel together Against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying, -- psalms 2:2
.
"Let us tear their fetters apart And cast away their cords from us!" -- psalms 2:3
.
He who sits in the heavens laughs, The Lord scoffs at them. -- psalms 2:4
.
Then He will speak to them in His anger And terrify them in His fury, saying, -- psalms 2:5
.
"But as for Me, I have installed My King Upon Zion, My holy mountain." -- psalms 2:6
.
"I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You. -- psalms 2:7
.
'Ask of Me, and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance, And the very ends of the earth as Your possession. -- psalms 2:8
.
'You shall break them with a rod of iron, You shall shatter them like earthenware.'" -- psalms 2:9
.
Now therefore, O kings, show discernment; Take warning, O judges of the earth. -- psalms 2:10
.
Worship the LORD with reverence And rejoice with trembling. -- psalms 2:11
.
Do homage to the Son, that He not become angry, and you perish in the way, For His wrath may soon be kindled. How blessed are all who take refuge in Him! -- psalms 2:12
.
O LORD, how my adversaries have increased! Many are rising up against me. -- psalms 3:1
.
Many are saying of my soul, "There is no deliverance for him in God." Selah. -- psalms 3:2
.
But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head. -- psalms 3:3
.
I was crying to the LORD with my voice, And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah. -- psalms 3:4
.
I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me. -- psalms 3:5
.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me round about. -- psalms 3:6
.
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God! For You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked. -- psalms 3:7
.
Salvation belongs to the LORD; Your blessing be upon Your people! Selah. -- psalms 3:8
.
Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer. -- psalms 4:1
.
O sons of men, how long will my honor become a reproach? How long will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? Selah. -- psalms 4:2
.
But know that the LORD has set apart the godly man for Himself; The LORD hears when I call to Him. -- psalms 4:3
.
Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. -- psalms 4:4
.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the LORD. -- psalms 4:5
.
Many are saying, "Who will show us any good?" Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O LORD! -- psalms 4:6
.
You have put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine abound. -- psalms 4:7
.
In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O LORD, make me to dwell in safety. -- psalms 4:8
.
Give ear to my words, O LORD, Consider my groaning. -- psalms 5:1
.
Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to You I pray. -- psalms 5:2
.
In the morning, O LORD, You will hear my voice; In the morning I will order my prayer to You and eagerly watch. -- psalms 5:3
.
For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil dwells with You. -- psalms 5:4
.
The boastful shall not stand before Your eyes; You hate all who do iniquity. -- psalms 5:5
.
You destroy those who speak falsehood; The LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit. -- psalms 5:6
.
But as for me, by Your abundant lovingkindness I will enter Your house, At Your holy temple I will bow in reverence for You. -- psalms 5:7
.
O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my foes; Make Your way straight before me. -- psalms 5:8
.
There is nothing reliable in what they say; Their inward part is destruction itself. Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue. -- psalms 5:9
.
Hold them guilty, O God; By their own devices let them fall! In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out, For they are rebellious against You. -- psalms 5:10
.
But let all who take refuge in You be glad, Let them ever sing for joy; And may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may exult in You. -- psalms 5:11
.
For it is You who blesses the righteous man, O LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield. -- psalms 5:12
.
O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your wrath. -- psalms 6:1
.
Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am pining away; Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are dismayed. -- psalms 6:2
.
And my soul is greatly dismayed; But You, O LORD--how long? -- psalms 6:3
.
Return, O LORD, rescue my soul; Save me because of Your lovingkindness. -- psalms 6:4
.
For there is no mention of You in death; In Sheol who will give You thanks? -- psalms 6:5
.
I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I dissolve my couch with my tears. -- psalms 6:6
.
My eye has wasted away with grief; It has become old because of all my adversaries. -- psalms 6:7
.
Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping. -- psalms 6:8
.
The LORD has heard my supplication, The LORD receives my prayer. -- psalms 6:9
.
All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed; They shall turn back, they will suddenly be ashamed. -- psalms 6:10
.
O LORD my God, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me, -- psalms 7:1
.
Or he will tear my soul like a lion, Dragging me away, while there is none to deliver. -- psalms 7:2
.
O LORD my God, if I have done this, If there is injustice in my hands, -- psalms 7:3
.
If I have rewarded evil to my friend, Or have plundered him who without cause was my adversary, -- psalms 7:4
.
Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; And let him trample my life down to the ground And lay my glory in the dust. Selah. -- psalms 7:5
.
Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; Lift up Yourself against the rage of my adversaries, And arouse Yourself for me; You have appointed judgment. -- psalms 7:6
.
Let the assembly of the peoples encompass You, And over them return on high. -- psalms 7:7
.
The LORD judges the peoples; Vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is in me. -- psalms 7:8
.
O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds. -- psalms 7:9
.
My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart. -- psalms 7:10
.
God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every day. -- psalms 7:11
.
If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready. -- psalms 7:12
.
He has also prepared for Himself deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts. -- psalms 7:13
.
Behold, he travails with wickedness, And he conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood. -- psalms 7:14
.
He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, And has fallen into the hole which he made. -- psalms 7:15
.
His mischief will return upon his own head, And his violence will descend upon his own pate. -- psalms 7:16
.
I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. -- psalms 7:17
.
O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens! -- psalms 8:1
.
From the mouth of infants and nursing babes You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease. -- psalms 8:2
.
When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained; -- psalms 8:3
.
What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him? -- psalms 8:4
.
Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown him with glory and majesty! -- psalms 8:5
.
You make him to rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, -- psalms 8:6
.
All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field, -- psalms 8:7
.
The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. -- psalms 8:8
.
O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth! -- psalms 8:9
.
I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will tell of all Your wonders. -- psalms 9:1
.
I will be glad and exult in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High. -- psalms 9:2
.
When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You. -- psalms 9:3
.
For You have maintained my just cause; You have sat on the throne judging righteously. -- psalms 9:4
.
You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked; You have blotted out their name forever and ever. -- psalms 9:5
.
The enemy has come to an end in perpetual ruins, And You have uprooted the cities; The very memory of them has perished. -- psalms 9:6
.
But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment, -- psalms 9:7
.
And He will judge the world in righteousness; He will execute judgment for the peoples with equity. -- psalms 9:8
.
The LORD also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble; -- psalms 9:9
.
And those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You. -- psalms 9:10
.
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; Declare among the peoples His deeds. -- psalms 9:11
.
For He who requires blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted. -- psalms 9:12
.
Be gracious to me, O LORD; See my affliction from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death, -- psalms 9:13
.
That I may tell of all Your praises, That in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation. -- psalms 9:14
.
The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught. -- psalms 9:15
.
The LORD has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared. Higgaion Selah. -- psalms 9:16
.
The wicked will return to Sheol, Even all the nations who forget God. -- psalms 9:17
.
For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever. -- psalms 9:18
.
Arise, O LORD, do not let man prevail; Let the nations be judged before You. -- psalms 9:19
.
Put them in fear, O LORD; Let the nations know that they are but men. Selah. -- psalms 9:20
.
Why do You stand afar off, O LORD? Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble? -- psalms 10:1
.
In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised. -- psalms 10:2
.
For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, And the greedy man curses and spurns the LORD. -- psalms 10:3
.
The wicked, in the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek Him. All his thoughts are, "There is no God." -- psalms 10:4
.
His ways prosper at all times; Your judgments are on high, out of his sight; As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them. -- psalms 10:5
.
He says to himself, "I will not be moved; Throughout all generations I will not be in adversity." -- psalms 10:6
.
His mouth is full of curses and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is mischief and wickedness. -- psalms 10:7
.
He sits in the lurking places of the villages; In the hiding places he kills the innocent; His eyes stealthily watch for the unfortunate. -- psalms 10:8
.
He lurks in a hiding place as a lion in his lair; He lurks to catch the afflicted; He catches the afflicted when he draws him into his net. -- psalms 10:9
.
He crouches, he bows down, And the unfortunate fall by his mighty ones. -- psalms 10:10
.
He says to himself, "God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see it." -- psalms 10:11
.
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Your hand. Do not forget the afflicted. -- psalms 10:12
.
Why has the wicked spurned God? He has said to himself, "You will not require it." -- psalms 10:13
.
You have seen it, for You have beheld mischief and vexation to take it into Your hand. The unfortunate commits himself to You; You have been the helper of the orphan. -- psalms 10:14
.
Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer, Seek out his wickedness until You find none. -- psalms 10:15
.
The LORD is King forever and ever; Nations have perished from His land. -- psalms 10:16
.
O LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart, You will incline Your ear -- psalms 10:17
.
To vindicate the orphan and the oppressed, So that man who is of the earth will no longer cause terror. -- psalms 10:18
.
In the LORD I take refuge; How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain; -- psalms 11:1
.
For, behold, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. -- psalms 11:2
.
If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do?" -- psalms 11:3
.
The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD'S throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men. -- psalms 11:4
.
The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked, And the one who loves violence His soul hates. -- psalms 11:5
.
Upon the wicked He will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind will be the portion of their cup. -- psalms 11:6
.
For the LORD is righteous, He loves righteousness; The upright will behold His face. -- psalms 11:7
.
Help, LORD, for the godly man ceases to be, For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men. -- psalms 12:1
.
They speak falsehood to one another; With flattering lips and with a double heart they speak. -- psalms 12:2
.
May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things; -- psalms 12:3
.
Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?" -- psalms 12:4
.
"Because of the devastation of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise," says the LORD; "I will set him in the safety for which he longs." -- psalms 12:5
.
The words of the LORD are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, refined seven times. -- psalms 12:6
.
You, O LORD, will keep them; You will preserve him from this generation forever. -- psalms 12:7
.
The wicked strut about on every side When vileness is exalted among the sons of men. -- psalms 12:8
.
How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? -- psalms 13:1
.
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? -- psalms 13:2
.
Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death, -- psalms 13:3
.
And my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken. -- psalms 13:4
.
But I have trusted in Your lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation. -- psalms 13:5
.
I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me. -- psalms 13:6
.
The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds; There is no one who does good. -- psalms 14:1
.
The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there are any who understand, Who seek after God. -- psalms 14:2
.
They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one. -- psalms 14:3
.
Do all the workers of wickedness not know, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call upon the Lord? -- psalms 14:4
.
There they are in great dread, For God is with the righteous generation. -- psalms 14:5
.
You would put to shame the counsel of the afflicted, But the LORD is his refuge. -- psalms 14:6
.
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad. -- psalms 14:7
.
O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill? -- psalms 15:1
.
He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart. -- psalms 15:2
.
He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend; -- psalms 15:3
.
In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honors those who fear the LORD; He swears to his own hurt and does not change; -- psalms 15:4
.
He does not put out his money at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken. -- psalms 15:5
.
Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You. -- psalms 16:1
.
I said to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good besides You." -- psalms 16:2
.
As for the saints who are in the earth, They are the majestic ones in whom is all my delight. -- psalms 16:3
.
The sorrows of those who have bartered for another god will be multiplied; I shall not pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor will I take their names upon my lips. -- psalms 16:4
.
The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You support my lot. -- psalms 16:5
.
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, my heritage is beautiful to me. -- psalms 16:6
.
I will bless the LORD who has counseled me; Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night. -- psalms 16:7
.
I have set the LORD continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. -- psalms 16:8
.
Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely. -- psalms 16:9
.
For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay. -- psalms 16:10
.
You will make known to me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever. -- psalms 16:11
.
Hear a just cause, O LORD, give heed to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips. -- psalms 17:1
.
Let my judgment come forth from Your presence; Let Your eyes look with equity. -- psalms 17:2
.
You have tried my heart; You have visited me by night; You have tested me and You find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress. -- psalms 17:3
.
As for the deeds of men, by the word of Your lips I have kept from the paths of the violent. -- psalms 17:4
.
My steps have held fast to Your paths. My feet have not slipped. -- psalms 17:5
.
I have called upon You, for You will answer me, O God; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech. -- psalms 17:6
.
Wondrously show Your lovingkindness, O Savior of those who take refuge at Your right hand From those who rise up against them. -- psalms 17:7
.
Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings -- psalms 17:8
.
From the wicked who despoil me, My deadly enemies who surround me. -- psalms 17:9
.
They have closed their unfeeling heart, With their mouth they speak proudly. -- psalms 17:10
.
They have now surrounded us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the ground. -- psalms 17:11
.
He is like a lion that is eager to tear, And as a young lion lurking in hiding places. -- psalms 17:12
.
Arise, O LORD, confront him, bring him low; Deliver my soul from the wicked with Your sword, -- psalms 17:13
.
From men with Your hand, O LORD, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly You fill with Your treasure; They are satisfied with children, And leave their abundance to their babes. -- psalms 17:14
.
As for me, I shall behold Your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake. -- psalms 17:15
.
"I love You, O LORD, my strength." -- psalms 18:1
.
The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. -- psalms 18:2
.
I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies. -- psalms 18:3
.
The cords of death encompassed me, And the torrents of ungodliness terrified me. -- psalms 18:4
.
The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me. -- psalms 18:5
.
In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried to my God for help; He heard my voice out of His temple, And my cry for help before Him came into His ears. -- psalms 18:6
.
Then the earth shook and quaked; And the foundations of the mountains were trembling And were shaken, because He was angry. -- psalms 18:7
.
Smoke went up out of His nostrils, And fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it. -- psalms 18:8
.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down With thick darkness under His feet. -- psalms 18:9
.
He rode upon a cherub and flew; And He sped upon the wings of the wind. -- psalms 18:10
.
He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. -- psalms 18:11
.
From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds, Hailstones and coals of fire. -- psalms 18:12
.
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of fire. -- psalms 18:13
.
He sent out His arrows, and scattered them, And lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them. -- psalms 18:14
.
Then the channels of water appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare At Your rebuke, O LORD, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. -- psalms 18:15
.
He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. -- psalms 18:16
.
He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me. -- psalms 18:17
.
They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my stay. -- psalms 18:18
.
He brought me forth also into a broad place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me. -- psalms 18:19
.
The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me. -- psalms 18:20
.
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God. -- psalms 18:21
.
For all His ordinances were before me, And I did not put away His statutes from me. -- psalms 18:22
.
I was also blameless with Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity. -- psalms 18:23
.
Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes. -- psalms 18:24
.
With the kind You show Yourself kind; With the blameless You show Yourself blameless; -- psalms 18:25
.
With the pure You show Yourself pure, And with the crooked You show Yourself astute. -- psalms 18:26
.
For You save an afflicted people, But haughty eyes You abase. -- psalms 18:27
.
For You light my lamp; The LORD my God illumines my darkness. -- psalms 18:28
.
For by You I can run upon a troop; And by my God I can leap over a wall. -- psalms 18:29
.
As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. -- psalms 18:30
.
For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God, -- psalms 18:31
.
The God who girds me with strength And makes my way blameless? -- psalms 18:32
.
He makes my feet like hinds' feet, And sets me upon my high places. -- psalms 18:33
.
He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. -- psalms 18:34
.
You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, And Your right hand upholds me; And Your gentleness makes me great. -- psalms 18:35
.
You enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped. -- psalms 18:36
.
I pursued my enemies and overtook them, And I did not turn back until they were consumed. -- psalms 18:37
.
I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise; They fell under my feet. -- psalms 18:38
.
For You have girded me with strength for battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. -- psalms 18:39
.
You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me. -- psalms 18:40
.
They cried for help, but there was none to save, Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them. -- psalms 18:41
.
Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind; I emptied them out as the mire of the streets. -- psalms 18:42
.
You have delivered me from the contentions of the people; You have placed me as head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me. -- psalms 18:43
.
As soon as they hear, they obey me; Foreigners submit to me. -- psalms 18:44
.
Foreigners fade away, And come trembling out of their fortresses. -- psalms 18:45
.
The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation, -- psalms 18:46
.
The God who executes vengeance for me, And subdues peoples under me. -- psalms 18:47
.
He delivers me from my enemies; Surely You lift me above those who rise up against me; You rescue me from the violent man. -- psalms 18:48
.
Therefore I will give thanks to You among the nations, O LORD, And I will sing praises to Your name. -- psalms 18:49
.
He gives great deliverance to His king, And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever. -- psalms 18:50
.
The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands. -- psalms 19:1
.
Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge. -- psalms 19:2
.
There is no speech, nor are there words; Their voice is not heard. -- psalms 19:3
.
Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their utterances to the end of the world. In them He has placed a tent for the sun, -- psalms 19:4
.
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; It rejoices as a strong man to run his course. -- psalms 19:5
.
Its rising is from one end of the heavens, And its circuit to the other end of them; And there is nothing hidden from its heat. -- psalms 19:6
.
The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. -- psalms 19:7
.
The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. -- psalms 19:8
.
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether. -- psalms 19:9
.
They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb. -- psalms 19:10
.
Moreover, by them Your servant is warned; In keeping them there is great reward. -- psalms 19:11
.
Who can discern his errors? Acquit me of hidden faults. -- psalms 19:12
.
Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins; Let them not rule over me; Then I will be blameless, And I shall be acquitted of great transgression. -- psalms 19:13
.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer. -- psalms 19:14
.
May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high! -- psalms 20:1
.
May He send you help from the sanctuary And support you from Zion! -- psalms 20:2
.
May He remember all your meal offerings And find your burnt offering acceptable! Selah. -- psalms 20:3
.
May He grant you your heart's desire And fulfill all your counsel! -- psalms 20:4
.
We will sing for joy over your victory, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners. May the LORD fulfill all your petitions. -- psalms 20:5
.
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand. -- psalms 20:6
.
Some boast in chariots and some in horses, But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God. -- psalms 20:7
.
They have bowed down and fallen, But we have risen and stood upright. -- psalms 20:8
.
Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call. -- psalms 20:9
.
O LORD, in Your strength the king will be glad, And in Your salvation how greatly he will rejoice! -- psalms 21:1
.
You have given him his heart's desire, And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah. -- psalms 21:2
.
For You meet him with the blessings of good things; You set a crown of fine gold on his head. -- psalms 21:3
.
He asked life of You, You gave it to him, Length of days forever and ever. -- psalms 21:4
.
His glory is great through Your salvation, Splendor and majesty You place upon him. -- psalms 21:5
.
For You make him most blessed forever; You make him joyful with gladness in Your presence. -- psalms 21:6
.
For the king trusts in the LORD, And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he will not be shaken. -- psalms 21:7
.
Your hand will find out all your enemies; Your right hand will find out those who hate you. -- psalms 21:8
.
You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger; The LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, And fire will devour them. -- psalms 21:9
.
Their offspring You will destroy from the earth, And their descendants from among the sons of men. -- psalms 21:10
.
Though they intended evil against You And devised a plot, They will not succeed. -- psalms 21:11
.
For You will make them turn their back; You will aim with Your bowstrings at their faces. -- psalms 21:12
.
Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; We will sing and praise Your power. -- psalms 21:13
.
My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning. -- psalms 22:1
.
O my God, I cry by day, but You do not answer; And by night, but I have no rest. -- psalms 22:2
.
Yet You are holy, O You who are enthroned upon the praises of Israel. -- psalms 22:3
.
In You our fathers trusted; They trusted and You delivered them. -- psalms 22:4
.
To You they cried out and were delivered; In You they trusted and were not disappointed. -- psalms 22:5
.
But I am a worm and not a man, A reproach of men and despised by the people. -- psalms 22:6
.
All who see me sneer at me; They separate with the lip, they wag the head, saying, -- psalms 22:7
.
"Commit yourself to the LORD; let Him deliver him; Let Him rescue him, because He delights in him." -- psalms 22:8
.
Yet You are He who brought me forth from the womb; You made me trust when upon my mother's breasts. -- psalms 22:9
.
Upon You I was cast from birth; You have been my God from my mother's womb. -- psalms 22:10
.
Be not far from me, for trouble is near; For there is none to help. -- psalms 22:11
.
Many bulls have surrounded me; Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me. -- psalms 22:12
.
They open wide their mouth at me, As a ravening and a roaring lion. -- psalms 22:13
.
I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax; It is melted within me. -- psalms 22:14
.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And my tongue cleaves to my jaws; And You lay me in the dust of death. -- psalms 22:15
.
For dogs have surrounded me; A band of evildoers has encompassed me; They pierced my hands and my feet. -- psalms 22:16
.
I can count all my bones. They look, they stare at me; -- psalms 22:17
.
They divide my garments among them, And for my clothing they cast lots. -- psalms 22:18
.
But You, O LORD, be not far off; O You my help, hasten to my assistance. -- psalms 22:19
.
Deliver my soul from the sword, My only life from the power of the dog. -- psalms 22:20
.
Save me from the lion's mouth; From the horns of the wild oxen You answer me. -- psalms 22:21
.
I will tell of Your name to my brethren; In the midst of the assembly I will praise You. -- psalms 22:22
.
You who fear the LORD, praise Him; All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him, And stand in awe of Him, all you descendants of Israel. -- psalms 22:23
.
For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Nor has He hidden His face from him; But when he cried to Him for help, He heard. -- psalms 22:24
.
From You comes my praise in the great assembly; I shall pay my vows before those who fear Him. -- psalms 22:25
.
The afflicted will eat and be satisfied; Those who seek Him will praise the LORD. Let your heart live forever! -- psalms 22:26
.
All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, And all the families of the nations will worship before You. -- psalms 22:27
.
For the kingdom is the LORD'S And He rules over the nations. -- psalms 22:28
.
All the prosperous of the earth will eat and worship, All those who go down to the dust will bow before Him, Even he who cannot keep his soul alive. -- psalms 22:29
.
Posterity will serve Him; It will be told of the Lord to the coming generation. -- psalms 22:30
.
They will come and will declare His righteousness To a people who will be born, that He has performed it. -- psalms 22:31
.
The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want. -- psalms 23:1
.
He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters. -- psalms 23:2
.
He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake. -- psalms 23:3
.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. -- psalms 23:4
.
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows. -- psalms 23:5
.
Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life, And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever. -- psalms 23:6
.
The earth is the LORD'S, and all it contains, The world, and those who dwell in it. -- psalms 24:1
.
For He has founded it upon the seas And established it upon the rivers. -- psalms 24:2
.
Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? And who may stand in His holy place? -- psalms 24:3
.
He who has clean hands and a pure heart, Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood And has not sworn deceitfully. -- psalms 24:4
.
He shall receive a blessing from the LORD And righteousness from the God of his salvation. -- psalms 24:5
.
This is the generation of those who seek Him, Who seek Your face--even Jacob. Selah. -- psalms 24:6
.
Lift up your heads, O gates, And be lifted up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in! -- psalms 24:7

.
Lift up your heads, O gates, And lift them up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in! -- psalms 24:9
.
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah. -- psalms 24:10
.
To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul. -- psalms 25:1
.
O my God, in You I trust, Do not let me be ashamed; Do not let my enemies exult over me. -- psalms 25:2
.
Indeed, none of those who wait for You will be ashamed; Those who deal treacherously without cause will be ashamed. -- psalms 25:3
.
Make me know Your ways, O LORD; Teach me Your paths. -- psalms 25:4
.
Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation; For You I wait all the day. -- psalms 25:5
.
Remember, O LORD, Your compassion and Your lovingkindnesses, For they have been from of old. -- psalms 25:6
.
Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; According to Your lovingkindness remember me, For Your goodness' sake, O LORD. -- psalms 25:7
.
Good and upright is the LORD; Therefore He instructs sinners in the way. -- psalms 25:8
.
He leads the humble in justice, And He teaches the humble His way. -- psalms 25:9
.
All the paths of the LORD are lovingkindness and truth To those who keep His covenant and His testimonies. -- psalms 25:10
.
For Your name's sake, O LORD, Pardon my iniquity, for it is great. -- psalms 25:11
.
Who is the man who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the way he should choose. -- psalms 25:12
.
His soul will abide in prosperity, And his descendants will inherit the land. -- psalms 25:13
.
The secret of the LORD is for those who fear Him, And He will make them know His covenant. -- psalms 25:14
.
My eyes are continually toward the LORD, For He will pluck my feet out of the net. -- psalms 25:15
.
Turn to me and be gracious to me, For I am lonely and afflicted. -- psalms 25:16
.
The troubles of my heart are enlarged; Bring me out of my distresses. -- psalms 25:17
.
Look upon my affliction and my trouble, And forgive all my sins. -- psalms 25:18
.
Look upon my enemies, for they are many, And they hate me with violent hatred. -- psalms 25:19
.
Guard my soul and deliver me; Do not let me be ashamed, for I take refuge in You. -- psalms 25:20
.
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for You. -- psalms 25:21
.
Redeem Israel, O God, Out of all his troubles. -- psalms 25:22
.
Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, And I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. -- psalms 26:1
.
Examine me, O LORD, and try me; Test my mind and my heart. -- psalms 26:2
.
For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth. -- psalms 26:3
.
I do not sit with deceitful men, Nor will I go with pretenders. -- psalms 26:4
.
I hate the assembly of evildoers, And I will not sit with the wicked. -- psalms 26:5
.
I shall wash my hands in innocence, And I will go about Your altar, O LORD, -- psalms 26:6
.
That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving And declare all Your wonders. -- psalms 26:7
.
O LORD, I love the habitation of Your house And the place where Your glory dwells. -- psalms 26:8
.
Do not take my soul away along with sinners, Nor my life with men of bloodshed, -- psalms 26:9
.
In whose hands is a wicked scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes. -- psalms 26:10
.
But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; Redeem me, and be gracious to me. -- psalms 26:11
.
My foot stands on a level place; In the congregations I shall bless the LORD. -- psalms 26:12
.
The LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the defense of my life; Whom shall I dread? -- psalms 27:1
.
When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell. -- psalms 27:2
.
Though a host encamp against me, My heart will not fear; Though war arise against me, In spite of this I shall be confident. -- psalms 27:3
.
One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD And to meditate in His temple. -- psalms 27:4
.
For in the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle; In the secret place of His tent He will hide me; He will lift me up on a rock. -- psalms 27:5
.
And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me, And I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD. -- psalms 27:6
.
Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice, And be gracious to me and answer me. -- psalms 27:7
.
When You said, "Seek My face," my heart said to You, "Your face, O LORD, I shall seek." -- psalms 27:8
.
Do not hide Your face from me, Do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; Do not abandon me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation! -- psalms 27:9
.
For my father and my mother have forsaken me, But the LORD will take me up. -- psalms 27:10
.
Teach me Your way, O LORD, And lead me in a level path Because of my foes. -- psalms 27:11
.
Do not deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, For false witnesses have risen against me, And such as breathe out violence. -- psalms 27:12
.
I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living. -- psalms 27:13
.
Wait for the LORD; Be strong and let your heart take courage; Yes, wait for the LORD. -- psalms 27:14
.
To You, O LORD, I call; My rock, do not be deaf to me, For if You are silent to me, I will become like those who go down to the pit. -- psalms 28:1
.
Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to You for help, When I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary. -- psalms 28:2
.
Do not drag me away with the wicked And with those who work iniquity, Who speak peace with their neighbors, While evil is in their hearts. -- psalms 28:3
.
Requite them according to their work and according to the evil of their practices; Requite them according to the deeds of their hands; Repay them their recompense. -- psalms 28:4
.
Because they do not regard the works of the LORD Nor the deeds of His hands, He will tear them down and not build them up. -- psalms 28:5
.
Blessed be the LORD, Because He has heard the voice of my supplication. -- psalms 28:6
.
The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I shall thank Him. -- psalms 28:7

.
The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; The God of glory thunders, The LORD is over many waters. -- psalms 29:3
.
The voice of the LORD is powerful, The voice of the LORD is majestic. -- psalms 29:4
.
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; Yes, the LORD breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. -- psalms 29:5
.
He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, And Sirion like a young wild ox. -- psalms 29:6
.
The voice of the LORD hews out flames of fire. -- psalms 29:7
.
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; The LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. -- psalms 29:8

.
The LORD will give strength to His people; The LORD will bless His people with peace. -- psalms 29:11
.
I will extol You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up, And have not let my enemies rejoice over me. -- psalms 30:1
.
O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me. -- psalms 30:2
.
O LORD, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, that I would not go down to the pit. -- psalms 30:3
.
Sing praise to the LORD, you His godly ones, And give thanks to His holy name. -- psalms 30:4
.
For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy comes in the morning. -- psalms 30:5
.
Now as for me, I said in my prosperity, "I will never be moved." -- psalms 30:6
.
O LORD, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, I was dismayed. -- psalms 30:7
.
To You, O LORD, I called, And to the Lord I made supplication: -- psalms 30:8
.
"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness? -- psalms 30:9
.
"Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me; O LORD, be my helper." -- psalms 30:10
.
You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness, -- psalms 30:11
.
That my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to You forever. -- psalms 30:12
.
In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed; In Your righteousness deliver me. -- psalms 31:1
.
Incline Your ear to me, rescue me quickly; Be to me a rock of strength, A stronghold to save me. -- psalms 31:2
.
For You are my rock and my fortress; For Your name's sake You will lead me and guide me. -- psalms 31:3
.
You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me, For You are my strength. -- psalms 31:4
.
Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have ransomed me, O LORD, God of truth. -- psalms 31:5
.
I hate those who regard vain idols, But I trust in the LORD. -- psalms 31:6
.
I will rejoice and be glad in Your lovingkindness, Because You have seen my affliction; You have known the troubles of my soul, -- psalms 31:7
.
And You have not given me over into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a large place. -- psalms 31:8
.
Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; My eye is wasted away from grief, my soul and my body also. -- psalms 31:9
.
For my life is spent with sorrow And my years with sighing; My strength has failed because of my iniquity, And my body has wasted away. -- psalms 31:10
.
Because of all my adversaries, I have become a reproach, Especially to my neighbors, And an object of dread to my acquaintances; Those who see me in the street flee from me. -- psalms 31:11
.
I am forgotten as a dead man, out of mind; I am like a broken vessel. -- psalms 31:12
.
For I have heard the slander of many, Terror is on every side; While they took counsel together against me, They schemed to take away my life. -- psalms 31:13
.
But as for me, I trust in You, O LORD, I say, "You are my God." -- psalms 31:14
.
My times are in Your hand; Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me. -- psalms 31:15
.
Make Your face to shine upon Your servant; Save me in Your lovingkindness. -- psalms 31:16
.
Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I call upon You; Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol. -- psalms 31:17
.
Let the lying lips be mute, Which speak arrogantly against the righteous With pride and contempt. -- psalms 31:18
.
How great is Your goodness, Which You have stored up for those who fear You, Which You have wrought for those who take refuge in You, Before the sons of men! -- psalms 31:19
.
You hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the conspiracies of man; You keep them secretly in a shelter from the strife of tongues. -- psalms 31:20
.
Blessed be the LORD, For He has made marvelous His lovingkindness to me in a besieged city. -- psalms 31:21
.
As for me, I said in my alarm, "I am cut off from before Your eyes"; Nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplications When I cried to You. -- psalms 31:22
.
O love the LORD, all you His godly ones! The LORD preserves the faithful And fully recompenses the proud doer. -- psalms 31:23
.
Be strong and let your heart take courage, All you who hope in the LORD. -- psalms 31:24
.
How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered! -- psalms 32:1
.
How blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit! -- psalms 32:2
.
When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away Through my groaning all day long. -- psalms 32:3
.
For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer. Selah. -- psalms 32:4
.
I acknowledged my sin to You, And my iniquity I did not hide; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"; And You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah. -- psalms 32:5
.
Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to You in a time when You may be found; Surely in a flood of great waters they will not reach him. -- psalms 32:6
.
You are my hiding place; You preserve me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah. -- psalms 32:7
.
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you with My eye upon you. -- psalms 32:8
.
Do not be as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding, Whose trappings include bit and bridle to hold them in check, Otherwise they will not come near to you. -- psalms 32:9
.
Many are the sorrows of the wicked, But he who trusts in the LORD, lovingkindness shall surround him. -- psalms 32:10
.
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous ones; And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart. -- psalms 32:11
.
Sing for joy in the LORD, O you righteous ones; Praise is becoming to the upright. -- psalms 33:1
.
Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre; Sing praises to Him with a harp of ten strings. -- psalms 33:2
.
Sing to Him a new song; Play skillfully with a shout of joy. -- psalms 33:3
.
For the word of the LORD is upright, And all His work is done in faithfulness. -- psalms 33:4
.
He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD. -- psalms 33:5
.
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host. -- psalms 33:6
.
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He lays up the deeps in storehouses. -- psalms 33:7
.
Let all the earth fear the LORD; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. -- psalms 33:8
.
For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast. -- psalms 33:9
.
The LORD nullifies the counsel of the nations; He frustrates the plans of the peoples. -- psalms 33:10
.
The counsel of the LORD stands forever, The plans of His heart from generation to generation. -- psalms 33:11
.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, The people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance. -- psalms 33:12
.
The LORD looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men; -- psalms 33:13
.
From His dwelling place He looks out On all the inhabitants of the earth, -- psalms 33:14
.
He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works. -- psalms 33:15
.
The king is not saved by a mighty army; A warrior is not delivered by great strength. -- psalms 33:16
.
A horse is a false hope for victory; Nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength. -- psalms 33:17
.
Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him, On those who hope for His lovingkindness, -- psalms 33:18
.
To deliver their soul from death And to keep them alive in famine. -- psalms 33:19
.
Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield. -- psalms 33:20
.
For our heart rejoices in Him, Because we trust in His holy name. -- psalms 33:21
.
Let Your lovingkindness, O LORD, be upon us, According as we have hoped in You. -- psalms 33:22
.
I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. -- psalms 34:1
.
My soul will make its boast in the LORD; The humble will hear it and rejoice. -- psalms 34:2
.
O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt His name together. -- psalms 34:3
.
I sought the LORD, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears. -- psalms 34:4
.
They looked to Him and were radiant, And their faces will never be ashamed. -- psalms 34:5
.
This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him And saved him out of all his troubles. -- psalms 34:6
.
The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, And rescues them. -- psalms 34:7
.
O taste and see that the LORD is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him! -- psalms 34:8
.
O fear the LORD, you His saints; For to those who fear Him there is no want. -- psalms 34:9
.
The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; But they who seek the LORD shall not be in want of any good thing. -- psalms 34:10
.
Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. -- psalms 34:11
.
Who is the man who desires life And loves length of days that he may see good? -- psalms 34:12
.
Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking deceit. -- psalms 34:13
.
Depart from evil and do good; Seek peace and pursue it. -- psalms 34:14
.
The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous And His ears are open to their cry. -- psalms 34:15
.
The face of the LORD is against evildoers, To cut off the memory of them from the earth. -- psalms 34:16
.
The righteous cry, and the LORD hears And delivers them out of all their troubles. -- psalms 34:17
.
The LORD is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are crushed in spirit. -- psalms 34:18
.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, But the LORD delivers him out of them all. -- psalms 34:19
.
He keeps all his bones, Not one of them is broken. -- psalms 34:20
.
Evil shall slay the wicked, And those who hate the righteous will be condemned. -- psalms 34:21
.
The LORD redeems the soul of His servants, And none of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned. -- psalms 34:22
.
Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; Fight against those who fight against me. -- psalms 35:1
.
Take hold of buckler and shield And rise up for my help. -- psalms 35:2
.
Draw also the spear and the battle-axe to meet those who pursue me; Say to my soul, "I am your salvation." -- psalms 35:3
.
Let those be ashamed and dishonored who seek my life; Let those be turned back and humiliated who devise evil against me. -- psalms 35:4
.
Let them be like chaff before the wind, With the angel of the LORD driving them on. -- psalms 35:5
.
Let their way be dark and slippery, With the angel of the LORD pursuing them. -- psalms 35:6
.
For without cause they hid their net for me; Without cause they dug a pit for my soul. -- psalms 35:7
.
Let destruction come upon him unawares, And let the net which he hid catch himself; Into that very destruction let him fall. -- psalms 35:8
.
And my soul shall rejoice in the LORD; It shall exult in His salvation. -- psalms 35:9
.
All my bones will say, "LORD, who is like You, Who delivers the afflicted from him who is too strong for him, And the afflicted and the needy from him who robs him?" -- psalms 35:10
.
Malicious witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I do not know. -- psalms 35:11
.
They repay me evil for good, To the bereavement of my soul. -- psalms 35:12
.
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my soul with fasting, And my prayer kept returning to my bosom. -- psalms 35:13
.
I went about as though it were my friend or brother; I bowed down mourning, as one who sorrows for a mother. -- psalms 35:14
.
But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered themselves together; The smiters whom I did not know gathered together against me, They slandered me without ceasing. -- psalms 35:15
.
Like godless jesters at a feast, They gnashed at me with their teeth. -- psalms 35:16
.
Lord, how long will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, My only life from the lions. -- psalms 35:17
.
I will give You thanks in the great congregation; I will praise You among a mighty throng. -- psalms 35:18
.
Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me; Nor let those who hate me without cause wink maliciously. -- psalms 35:19
.
For they do not speak peace, But they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land. -- psalms 35:20
.
They opened their mouth wide against me; They said, "Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it!" -- psalms 35:21
.
You have seen it, O LORD, do not keep silent; O Lord, do not be far from me. -- psalms 35:22
.
Stir up Yourself, and awake to my right And to my cause, my God and my Lord. -- psalms 35:23
.
Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Your righteousness, And do not let them rejoice over me. -- psalms 35:24
.
Do not let them say in their heart, "Aha, our desire!" Do not let them say, "We have swallowed him up!" -- psalms 35:25
.
Let those be ashamed and humiliated altogether who rejoice at my distress; Let those be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves over me. -- psalms 35:26
.
Let them shout for joy and rejoice, who favor my vindication; And let them say continually, "The LORD be magnified, Who delights in the prosperity of His servant." -- psalms 35:27
.
And my tongue shall declare Your righteousness And Your praise all day long. -- psalms 35:28
.
Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes. -- psalms 36:1
.
For it flatters him in his own eyes Concerning the discovery of his iniquity and the hatred of it. -- psalms 36:2
.
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise and to do good. -- psalms 36:3
.
He plans wickedness upon his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not despise evil. -- psalms 36:4
.
Your lovingkindness, O LORD, extends to the heavens, Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. -- psalms 36:5
.
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; Your judgments are like a great deep. O LORD, You preserve man and beast. -- psalms 36:6
.
How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings. -- psalms 36:7
.
They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house; And You give them to drink of the river of Your delights. -- psalms 36:8
.
For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light. -- psalms 36:9
.
O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart. -- psalms 36:10
.
Let not the foot of pride come upon me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. -- psalms 36:11
.
There the doers of iniquity have fallen; They have been thrust down and cannot rise. -- psalms 36:12
.
Do not fret because of evildoers, Be not envious toward wrongdoers. -- psalms 37:1
.
For they will wither quickly like the grass And fade like the green herb. -- psalms 37:2
.
Trust in the LORD and do good; Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness. -- psalms 37:3
.
Delight yourself in the LORD; And He will give you the desires of your heart. -- psalms 37:4
.
Commit your way to the LORD, Trust also in Him, and He will do it. -- psalms 37:5
.
He will bring forth your righteousness as the light And your judgment as the noonday. -- psalms 37:6
.
Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who carries out wicked schemes. -- psalms 37:7
.
Cease from anger and forsake wrath; Do not fret; it leads only to evildoing. -- psalms 37:8
.
For evildoers will be cut off, But those who wait for the LORD, they will inherit the land. -- psalms 37:9
.
Yet a little while and the wicked man will be no more; And you will look carefully for his place and he will not be there. -- psalms 37:10
.
But the humble will inherit the land And will delight themselves in abundant prosperity. -- psalms 37:11
.
The wicked plots against the righteous And gnashes at him with his teeth. -- psalms 37:12
.
The Lord laughs at him, For He sees his day is coming. -- psalms 37:13
.
The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow To cast down the afflicted and the needy, To slay those who are upright in conduct. -- psalms 37:14
.
Their sword will enter their own heart, And their bows will be broken. -- psalms 37:15
.
Better is the little of the righteous Than the abundance of many wicked. -- psalms 37:16
.
For the arms of the wicked will be broken, But the LORD sustains the righteous. -- psalms 37:17
.
The LORD knows the days of the blameless, And their inheritance will be forever. -- psalms 37:18
.
They will not be ashamed in the time of evil, And in the days of famine they will have abundance. -- psalms 37:19
.
But the wicked will perish; And the enemies of the LORD will be like the glory of the pastures, They vanish--like smoke they vanish away. -- psalms 37:20
.
The wicked borrows and does not pay back, But the righteous is gracious and gives. -- psalms 37:21
.
For those blessed by Him will inherit the land, But those cursed by Him will be cut off. -- psalms 37:22
.
The steps of a man are established by the LORD, And He delights in his way. -- psalms 37:23
.
When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong, Because the LORD is the One who holds his hand. -- psalms 37:24
.
I have been young and now I am old, Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken Or his descendants begging bread. -- psalms 37:25
.
All day long he is gracious and lends, And his descendants are a blessing. -- psalms 37:26
.
Depart from evil and do good, So you will abide forever. -- psalms 37:27
.
For the LORD loves justice And does not forsake His godly ones; They are preserved forever, But the descendants of the wicked will be cut off. -- psalms 37:28
.
The righteous will inherit the land And dwell in it forever. -- psalms 37:29
.
The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, And his tongue speaks justice. -- psalms 37:30
.
The law of his God is in his heart; His steps do not slip. -- psalms 37:31
.
The wicked spies upon the righteous And seeks to kill him. -- psalms 37:32
.
The LORD will not leave him in his hand Or let him be condemned when he is judged. -- psalms 37:33
.
Wait for the LORD and keep His way, And He will exalt you to inherit the land; When the wicked are cut off, you will see it. -- psalms 37:34
.
I have seen a wicked, violent man Spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil. -- psalms 37:35
.
Then he passed away, and lo, he was no more; I sought for him, but he could not be found. -- psalms 37:36
.
Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright; For the man of peace will have a posterity. -- psalms 37:37
.
But transgressors will be altogether destroyed; The posterity of the wicked will be cut off. -- psalms 37:38
.
But the salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their strength in time of trouble. -- psalms 37:39
.
The LORD helps them and delivers them; He delivers them from the wicked and saves them, Because they take refuge in Him. -- psalms 37:40
.
O LORD, rebuke me not in Your wrath, And chasten me not in Your burning anger. -- psalms 38:1
.
For Your arrows have sunk deep into me, And Your hand has pressed down on me. -- psalms 38:2
.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation; There is no health in my bones because of my sin. -- psalms 38:3
.
For my iniquities are gone over my head; As a heavy burden they weigh too much for me. -- psalms 38:4
.
My wounds grow foul and fester Because of my folly. -- psalms 38:5
.
I am bent over and greatly bowed down; I go mourning all day long. -- psalms 38:6
.
For my loins are filled with burning, And there is no soundness in my flesh. -- psalms 38:7
.
I am benumbed and badly crushed; I groan because of the agitation of my heart. -- psalms 38:8
.
Lord, all my desire is before You; And my sighing is not hidden from You. -- psalms 38:9
.
My heart throbs, my strength fails me; And the light of my eyes, even that has gone from me. -- psalms 38:10
.
My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off. -- psalms 38:11
.
Those who seek my life lay snares for me; And those who seek to injure me have threatened destruction, And they devise treachery all day long. -- psalms 38:12
.
But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; And I am like a mute man who does not open his mouth. -- psalms 38:13
.
Yes, I am like a man who does not hear, And in whose mouth are no arguments. -- psalms 38:14
.
For I hope in You, O LORD; You will answer, O Lord my God. -- psalms 38:15
.
For I said, "May they not rejoice over me, Who, when my foot slips, would magnify themselves against me." -- psalms 38:16
.
For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me. -- psalms 38:17
.
For I confess my iniquity; I am full of anxiety because of my sin. -- psalms 38:18
.
But my enemies are vigorous and strong, And many are those who hate me wrongfully. -- psalms 38:19
.
And those who repay evil for good, They oppose me, because I follow what is good. -- psalms 38:20
.
Do not forsake me, O LORD; O my God, do not be far from me! -- psalms 38:21
.
Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation! -- psalms 38:22
.
I said, "I will guard my ways That I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle While the wicked are in my presence." -- psalms 39:1
.
I was mute and silent, I refrained even from good, And my sorrow grew worse. -- psalms 39:2
.
My heart was hot within me, While I was musing the fire burned; Then I spoke with my tongue: -- psalms 39:3
.
"LORD, make me to know my end And what is the extent of my days; Let me know how transient I am. -- psalms 39:4
.
"Behold, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight; Surely every man at his best is a mere breath. Selah. -- psalms 39:5
.
"Surely every man walks about as a phantom; Surely they make an uproar for nothing; He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them. -- psalms 39:6
.
"And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You. -- psalms 39:7
.
"Deliver me from all my transgressions; Make me not the reproach of the foolish. -- psalms 39:8
.
"I have become mute, I do not open my mouth, Because it is You who have done it. -- psalms 39:9
.
"Remove Your plague from me; Because of the opposition of Your hand I am perishing. -- psalms 39:10
.
"With reproofs You chasten a man for iniquity; You consume as a moth what is precious to him; Surely every man is a mere breath. Selah. -- psalms 39:11
.
"Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with You, A sojourner like all my fathers. -- psalms 39:12
.
"Turn Your gaze away from me, that I may smile again Before I depart and am no more." -- psalms 39:13
.
I waited patiently for the LORD; And He inclined to me and heard my cry. -- psalms 40:1
.
He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay, And He set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm. -- psalms 40:2
.
He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear And will trust in the LORD. -- psalms 40:3
.
How blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, And has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood. -- psalms 40:4
.
Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders which You have done, And Your thoughts toward us; There is none to compare with You. If I would declare and speak of them, They would be too numerous to count. -- psalms 40:5
.
Sacrifice and meal offering You have not desired; My ears You have opened; Burnt offering and sin offering You have not required. -- psalms 40:6
.
Then I said, "Behold, I come; In the scroll of the book it is written of me. -- psalms 40:7
.
I delight to do Your will, O my God; Your Law is within my heart." -- psalms 40:8
.
I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great congregation; Behold, I will not restrain my lips, O LORD, You know. -- psalms 40:9
.
I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great congregation. -- psalms 40:10
.
You, O LORD, will not withhold Your compassion from me; Your lovingkindness and Your truth will continually preserve me. -- psalms 40:11
.
For evils beyond number have surrounded me; My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see; They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, And my heart has failed me. -- psalms 40:12
.
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; Make haste, O LORD, to help me. -- psalms 40:13
.
Let those be ashamed and humiliated together Who seek my life to destroy it; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt. -- psalms 40:14
.
Let those be appalled because of their shame Who say to me, "Aha, aha!" -- psalms 40:15
.
Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; Let those who love Your salvation say continually, "The LORD be magnified!" -- psalms 40:16
.
Since I am afflicted and needy, Let the Lord be mindful of me. You are my help and my deliverer; Do not delay, O my God. -- psalms 40:17
.
How blessed is he who considers the helpless; The LORD will deliver him in a day of trouble. -- psalms 41:1
.
The LORD will protect him and keep him alive, And he shall be called blessed upon the earth; And do not give him over to the desire of his enemies. -- psalms 41:2
.
The LORD will sustain him upon his sickbed; In his illness, You restore him to health. -- psalms 41:3
.
As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You." -- psalms 41:4
.
My enemies speak evil against me, "When will he die, and his name perish?" -- psalms 41:5
.
And when he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood; His heart gathers wickedness to itself; When he goes outside, he tells it. -- psalms 41:6
.
All who hate me whisper together against me; Against me they devise my hurt, saying, -- psalms 41:7
.
"A wicked thing is poured out upon him, That when he lies down, he will not rise up again." -- psalms 41:8
.
Even my close friend in whom I trusted, Who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me. -- psalms 41:9
.
But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, That I may repay them. -- psalms 41:10
.
By this I know that You are pleased with me, Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me. -- psalms 41:11
.
As for me, You uphold me in my integrity, And You set me in Your presence forever. -- psalms 41:12
.
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen. -- psalms 41:13
.
As the deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for You, O God. -- psalms 42:1
.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; When shall I come and appear before God? -- psalms 42:2
.
My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?" -- psalms 42:3
.
These things I remember and I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go along with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God, With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival. -- psalms 42:4
.
Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him For the help of His presence. -- psalms 42:5
.
O my God, my soul is in despair within me; Therefore I remember You from the land of the Jordan And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar. -- psalms 42:6
.
Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; All Your breakers and Your waves have rolled over me. -- psalms 42:7
.
The LORD will command His lovingkindness in the daytime; And His song will be with me in the night, A prayer to the God of my life. -- psalms 42:8
.
I will say to God my rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?" -- psalms 42:9
.
As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?" -- psalms 42:10
.
Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God. -- psalms 42:11
.
Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man! -- psalms 43:1
.
For You are the God of my strength; why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? -- psalms 43:2
.
O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places. -- psalms 43:3
.
Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And upon the lyre I shall praise You, O God, my God. -- psalms 43:4
.
Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God. -- psalms 43:5
.
O God, we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have told us The work that You did in their days, In the days of old. -- psalms 44:1
.
You with Your own hand drove out the nations; Then You planted them; You afflicted the peoples, Then You spread them abroad. -- psalms 44:2
.
For by their own sword they did not possess the land, And their own arm did not save them, But Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your presence, For You favored them. -- psalms 44:3
.
You are my King, O God; Command victories for Jacob. -- psalms 44:4
.
Through You we will push back our adversaries; Through Your name we will trample down those who rise up against us. -- psalms 44:5
.
For I will not trust in my bow, Nor will my sword save me. -- psalms 44:6
.
But You have saved us from our adversaries, And You have put to shame those who hate us. -- psalms 44:7
.
In God we have boasted all day long, And we will give thanks to Your name forever. Selah. -- psalms 44:8
.
Yet You have rejected us and brought us to dishonor, And do not go out with our armies. -- psalms 44:9
.
You cause us to turn back from the adversary; And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves. -- psalms 44:10
.
You give us as sheep to be eaten And have scattered us among the nations. -- psalms 44:11
.
You sell Your people cheaply, And have not profited by their sale. -- psalms 44:12
.
You make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to those around us. -- psalms 44:13
.
You make us a byword among the nations, A laughingstock among the peoples. -- psalms 44:14
.
All day long my dishonor is before me And my humiliation has overwhelmed me, -- psalms 44:15
.
Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles, Because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger. -- psalms 44:16
.
All this has come upon us, but we have not forgotten You, And we have not dealt falsely with Your covenant. -- psalms 44:17
.
Our heart has not turned back, And our steps have not deviated from Your way, -- psalms 44:18
.
Yet You have crushed us in a place of jackals And covered us with the shadow of death. -- psalms 44:19
.
If we had forgotten the name of our God Or extended our hands to a strange god, -- psalms 44:20
.
Would not God find this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart. -- psalms 44:21
.
But for Your sake we are killed all day long; We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. -- psalms 44:22
.
Arouse Yourself, why do You sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not reject us forever. -- psalms 44:23
.
Why do You hide Your face And forget our affliction and our oppression? -- psalms 44:24
.
For our soul has sunk down into the dust; Our body cleaves to the earth. -- psalms 44:25
.
Rise up, be our help, And redeem us for the sake of Your lovingkindness. -- psalms 44:26
.
My heart overflows with a good theme; I address my verses to the King; My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. -- psalms 45:1
.
You are fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Your lips; Therefore God has blessed You forever. -- psalms 45:2
.
Gird Your sword on Your thigh, O Mighty One, In Your splendor and Your majesty! -- psalms 45:3
.
And in Your majesty ride on victoriously, For the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; Let Your right hand teach You awesome things. -- psalms 45:4
.
Your arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under You; Your arrows are in the heart of the King's enemies. -- psalms 45:5
.
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom. -- psalms 45:6
.
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of joy above Your fellows. -- psalms 45:7
.
All Your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made You glad. -- psalms 45:8
.
Kings' daughters are among Your noble ladies; At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir. -- psalms 45:9
.
Listen, O daughter, give attention and incline your ear: Forget your people and your father's house; -- psalms 45:10
.
Then the King will desire your beauty. Because He is your Lord, bow down to Him. -- psalms 45:11
.
The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; The rich among the people will seek your favor. -- psalms 45:12
.
The King's daughter is all glorious within; Her clothing is interwoven with gold. -- psalms 45:13
.
She will be led to the King in embroidered work; The virgins, her companions who follow her, Will be brought to You. -- psalms 45:14
.
They will be led forth with gladness and rejoicing; They will enter into the King's palace. -- psalms 45:15
.
In place of your fathers will be your sons; You shall make them princes in all the earth. -- psalms 45:16
.
I will cause Your name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the peoples will give You thanks forever and ever. -- psalms 45:17
.
God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble. -- psalms 46:1
.
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change And though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea; -- psalms 46:2
.
Though its waters roar and foam, Though the mountains quake at its swelling pride. Selah. -- psalms 46:3
.
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling places of the Most High. -- psalms 46:4
.
God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns. -- psalms 46:5
.
The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered; He raised His voice, the earth melted. -- psalms 46:6
.
The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah. -- psalms 46:7
.
Come, behold the works of the LORD, Who has wrought desolations in the earth. -- psalms 46:8
.
He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire. -- psalms 46:9
.
"Cease striving and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth." -- psalms 46:10
.
The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah. -- psalms 46:11
.
O clap your hands, all peoples; Shout to God with the voice of joy. -- psalms 47:1
.
For the LORD Most High is to be feared, A great King over all the earth. -- psalms 47:2
.
He subdues peoples under us And nations under our feet. -- psalms 47:3
.
He chooses our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom He loves. Selah. -- psalms 47:4
.
God has ascended with a shout, The LORD, with the sound of a trumpet. -- psalms 47:5
.
Sing praises to God, sing praises; Sing praises to our King, sing praises. -- psalms 47:6
.
For God is the King of all the earth; Sing praises with a skillful psalm. -- psalms 47:7
.
God reigns over the nations, God sits on His holy throne. -- psalms 47:8
.
The princes of the people have assembled themselves as the people of the God of Abraham, For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted. -- psalms 47:9
.
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, His holy mountain. -- psalms 48:1
.
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion in the far north, The city of the great King. -- psalms 48:2
.
God, in her palaces, Has made Himself known as a stronghold. -- psalms 48:3
.
For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together. -- psalms 48:4
.
They saw it, then they were amazed; They were terrified, they fled in alarm. -- psalms 48:5
.
Panic seized them there, Anguish, as of a woman in childbirth. -- psalms 48:6
.
With the east wind You break the ships of Tarshish. -- psalms 48:7
.
As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish her forever. Selah. -- psalms 48:8
.
We have thought on Your lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of Your temple. -- psalms 48:9
.
As is Your name, O God, So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. -- psalms 48:10
.
Let Mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments. -- psalms 48:11
.
Walk about Zion and go around her; Count her towers; -- psalms 48:12
.
Consider her ramparts; Go through her palaces, That you may tell it to the next generation. -- psalms 48:13
.
For such is God, Our God forever and ever; He will guide us until death. -- psalms 48:14
.
Hear this, all peoples; Give ear, all inhabitants of the world, -- psalms 49:1
.
Both low and high, Rich and poor together. -- psalms 49:2
.
My mouth will speak wisdom, And the meditation of my heart will be understanding. -- psalms 49:3
.
I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will express my riddle on the harp. -- psalms 49:4
.
Why should I fear in days of adversity, When the iniquity of my foes surrounds me, -- psalms 49:5
.
Even those who trust in their wealth And boast in the abundance of their riches? -- psalms 49:6
.
No man can by any means redeem his brother Or give to God a ransom for him-- -- psalms 49:7
.
For the redemption of his soul is costly, And he should cease trying forever-- -- psalms 49:8
.
That he should live on eternally, That he should not undergo decay. -- psalms 49:9
.
For he sees that even wise men die; The stupid and the senseless alike perish And leave their wealth to others. -- psalms 49:10
.
Their inner thought is that their houses are forever And their dwelling places to all generations; They have called their lands after their own names. -- psalms 49:11
.
But man in his pomp will not endure; He is like the beasts that perish. -- psalms 49:12
.
This is the way of those who are foolish, And of those after them who approve their words. Selah. -- psalms 49:13
.
As sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall rule over them in the morning, And their form shall be for Sheol to consume So that they have no habitation. -- psalms 49:14
.
But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, For He will receive me. Selah. -- psalms 49:15
.
Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, When the glory of his house is increased; -- psalms 49:16
.
For when he dies he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him. -- psalms 49:17
.
Though while he lives he congratulates himself-- And though men praise you when you do well for yourself-- -- psalms 49:18
.
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They will never see the light. -- psalms 49:19
.
Man in his pomp, yet without understanding, Is like the beasts that perish. -- psalms 49:20
.
The Mighty One, God, the LORD, has spoken, And summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. -- psalms 50:1
.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth. -- psalms 50:2
.
May our God come and not keep silence; Fire devours before Him, And it is very tempestuous around Him. -- psalms 50:3
.
He summons the heavens above, And the earth, to judge His people: -- psalms 50:4
.
"Gather My godly ones to Me, Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice." -- psalms 50:5
.
And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is judge. Selah. -- psalms 50:6
.
"Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you; I am God, your God. -- psalms 50:7
.
"I do not reprove you for your sacrifices, And your burnt offerings are continually before Me. -- psalms 50:8
.
"I shall take no young bull out of your house Nor male goats out of your folds. -- psalms 50:9
.
"For every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills. -- psalms 50:10
.
"I know every bird of the mountains, And everything that moves in the field is Mine. -- psalms 50:11
.
"If I were hungry I would not tell you, For the world is Mine, and all it contains. -- psalms 50:12
.
"Shall I eat the flesh of bulls Or drink the blood of male goats? -- psalms 50:13
.
"Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving And pay your vows to the Most High; -- psalms 50:14
.
Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I shall rescue you, and you will honor Me." -- psalms 50:15
.
But to the wicked God says, "What right have you to tell of My statutes And to take My covenant in your mouth? -- psalms 50:16
.
"For you hate discipline, And you cast My words behind you. -- psalms 50:17
.
"When you see a thief, you are pleased with him, And you associate with adulterers. -- psalms 50:18
.
"You let your mouth loose in evil And your tongue frames deceit. -- psalms 50:19
.
"You sit and speak against your brother; You slander your own mother's son. -- psalms 50:20
.
"These things you have done and I kept silence; You thought that I was just like you; I will reprove you and state the case in order before your eyes. -- psalms 50:21
.
"Now consider this, you who forget God, Or I will tear you in pieces, and there will be none to deliver. -- psalms 50:22
.
"He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; And to him who orders his way aright I shall show the salvation of God." -- psalms 50:23
.
Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; According to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions. -- psalms 51:1
.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity And cleanse me from my sin. -- psalms 51:2
.
For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me. -- psalms 51:3
.
Against You, You only, I have sinned And done what is evil in Your sight, So that You are justified when You speak And blameless when You judge. -- psalms 51:4
.
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me. -- psalms 51:5
.
Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, And in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom. -- psalms 51:6
.
Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. -- psalms 51:7
.
Make me to hear joy and gladness, Let the bones which You have broken rejoice. -- psalms 51:8
.
Hide Your face from my sins And blot out all my iniquities. -- psalms 51:9
.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me. -- psalms 51:10
.
Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. -- psalms 51:11
.
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation And sustain me with a willing spirit. -- psalms 51:12
.
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners will be converted to You. -- psalms 51:13
.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation; Then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness. -- psalms 51:14
.
O Lord, open my lips, That my mouth may declare Your praise. -- psalms 51:15
.
For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; You are not pleased with burnt offering. -- psalms 51:16
.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise. -- psalms 51:17
.
By Your favor do good to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem. -- psalms 51:18
.
Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, In burnt offering and whole burnt offering; Then young bulls will be offered on Your altar. -- psalms 51:19
.
Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endures all day long. -- psalms 52:1
.
Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, O worker of deceit. -- psalms 52:2
.
You love evil more than good, Falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah. -- psalms 52:3
.
You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue. -- psalms 52:4
.
But God will break you down forever; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah. -- psalms 52:5
.
The righteous will see and fear, And will laugh at him, saying, -- psalms 52:6
.
"Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge, But trusted in the abundance of his riches And was strong in his evil desire." -- psalms 52:7
.
But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever. -- psalms 52:8
.
I will give You thanks forever, because You have done it, And I will wait on Your name, for it is good, in the presence of Your godly ones. -- psalms 52:9
.
The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God," They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice; There is no one who does good. -- psalms 53:1
.
God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there is anyone who understands, Who seeks after God. -- psalms 53:2
.
Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one. -- psalms 53:3
.
Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up My people as though they ate bread And have not called upon God? -- psalms 53:4
.
There they were in great fear where no fear had been; For God scattered the bones of him who encamped against you; You put them to shame, because God had rejected them. -- psalms 53:5
.
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores His captive people, Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. -- psalms 53:6
.
Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your power. -- psalms 54:1
.
Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. -- psalms 54:2
.
For strangers have risen against me And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah. -- psalms 54:3
.
Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul. -- psalms 54:4
.
He will recompense the evil to my foes; Destroy them in Your faithfulness. -- psalms 54:5
.
Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks to Your name, O LORD, for it is good. -- psalms 54:6
.
For He has delivered me from all trouble, And my eye has looked with satisfaction upon my enemies. -- psalms 54:7
.
Give ear to my prayer, O God; And do not hide Yourself from my supplication. -- psalms 55:1
.
Give heed to me and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and am surely distracted, -- psalms 55:2
.
Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the pressure of the wicked; For they bring down trouble upon me And in anger they bear a grudge against me. -- psalms 55:3
.
My heart is in anguish within me, And the terrors of death have fallen upon me. -- psalms 55:4
.
Fear and trembling come upon me, And horror has overwhelmed me. -- psalms 55:5
.
I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. -- psalms 55:6
.
"Behold, I would wander far away, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah. -- psalms 55:7
.
"I would hasten to my place of refuge From the stormy wind and tempest." -- psalms 55:8
.
Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongues, For I have seen violence and strife in the city. -- psalms 55:9
.
Day and night they go around her upon her walls, And iniquity and mischief are in her midst. -- psalms 55:10
.
Destruction is in her midst; Oppression and deceit do not depart from her streets. -- psalms 55:11
.
For it is not an enemy who reproaches me, Then I could bear it; Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me, Then I could hide myself from him. -- psalms 55:12
.
But it is you, a man my equal, My companion and my familiar friend; -- psalms 55:13
.
We who had sweet fellowship together Walked in the house of God in the throng. -- psalms 55:14
.
Let death come deceitfully upon them; Let them go down alive to Sheol, For evil is in their dwelling, in their midst. -- psalms 55:15
.
As for me, I shall call upon God, And the LORD will save me. -- psalms 55:16
.
Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and murmur, And He will hear my voice. -- psalms 55:17
.
He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle which is against me, For they are many who strive with me. -- psalms 55:18
.
God will hear and answer them-- Even the one who sits enthroned from of old-- Selah. With whom there is no change, And who do not fear God. -- psalms 55:19
.
He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; He has violated his covenant. -- psalms 55:20
.
His speech was smoother than butter, But his heart was war; His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn swords. -- psalms 55:21
.
Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken. -- psalms 55:22
.
But You, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction; Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You. -- psalms 55:23
.
Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled upon me; Fighting all day long he oppresses me. -- psalms 56:1
.
My foes have trampled upon me all day long, For they are many who fight proudly against me. -- psalms 56:2
.
When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You. -- psalms 56:3
.
In God, whose word I praise, In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can mere man do to me? -- psalms 56:4
.
All day long they distort my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil. -- psalms 56:5
.
They attack, they lurk, They watch my steps, As they have waited to take my life. -- psalms 56:6
.
Because of wickedness, cast them forth, In anger put down the peoples, O God! -- psalms 56:7
.
You have taken account of my wanderings; Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book? -- psalms 56:8
.
Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call; This I know, that God is for me. -- psalms 56:9
.
In God, whose word I praise, In the LORD, whose word I praise, -- psalms 56:10
.
In God I have put my trust, I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me? -- psalms 56:11
.
Your vows are binding upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You. -- psalms 56:12
.
For You have delivered my soul from death, Indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the living. -- psalms 56:13
.
Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge Until destruction passes by. -- psalms 57:1
.
I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all things for me. -- psalms 57:2
.
He will send from heaven and save me; He reproaches him who tramples upon me. Selah. God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth. -- psalms 57:3
.
My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows And their tongue a sharp sword. -- psalms 57:4
.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Let Your glory be above all the earth. -- psalms 57:5
.
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They dug a pit before me; They themselves have fallen into the midst of it. Selah. -- psalms 57:6
.
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises! -- psalms 57:7
.
Awake, my glory! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. -- psalms 57:8
.
I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations. -- psalms 57:9
.
For Your lovingkindness is great to the heavens And Your truth to the clouds. -- psalms 57:10
.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Let Your glory be above all the earth. -- psalms 57:11
.
Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men? -- psalms 58:1
.
No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands. -- psalms 58:2
.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth. -- psalms 58:3
.
They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear, -- psalms 58:4
.
So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, Or a skillful caster of spells. -- psalms 58:5
.
O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD. -- psalms 58:6
.
Let them flow away like water that runs off; When he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts. -- psalms 58:7
.
Let them be as a snail which melts away as it goes along, Like the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun. -- psalms 58:8
.
Before your pots can feel the fire of thorns He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike. -- psalms 58:9
.
The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. -- psalms 58:10
.
And men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; Surely there is a God who judges on earth!" -- psalms 58:11
.
Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; Set me securely on high away from those who rise up against me. -- psalms 59:1
.
Deliver me from those who do iniquity And save me from men of bloodshed. -- psalms 59:2
.
For behold, they have set an ambush for my life; Fierce men launch an attack against me, Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O LORD, -- psalms 59:3
.
For no guilt of mine, they run and set themselves against me. Arouse Yourself to help me, and see! -- psalms 59:4
.
You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any who are treacherous in iniquity. Selah. -- psalms 59:5
.
They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city. -- psalms 59:6
.
Behold, they belch forth with their mouth; Swords are in their lips, For, they say, "Who hears?" -- psalms 59:7
.
But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations. -- psalms 59:8
.
Because of his strength I will watch for You, For God is my stronghold. -- psalms 59:9
.
My God in His lovingkindness will meet me; God will let me look triumphantly upon my foes. -- psalms 59:10
.
Do not slay them, or my people will forget; Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield. -- psalms 59:11
.
On account of the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, Let them even be caught in their pride, And on account of curses and lies which they utter. -- psalms 59:12
.
Destroy them in wrath, destroy them that they may be no more; That men may know that God rules in Jacob To the ends of the earth. Selah. -- psalms 59:13
.
They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city. -- psalms 59:14
.
They wander about for food And growl if they are not satisfied. -- psalms 59:15
.
But as for me, I shall sing of Your strength; Yes, I shall joyfully sing of Your lovingkindness in the morning, For You have been my stronghold And a refuge in the day of my distress. -- psalms 59:16
.
O my strength, I will sing praises to You; For God is my stronghold, the God who shows me lovingkindness. -- psalms 59:17
.
O God, You have rejected us. You have broken us; You have been angry; O, restore us. -- psalms 60:1
.
You have made the land quake, You have split it open; Heal its breaches, for it totters. -- psalms 60:2
.
You have made Your people experience hardship; You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger. -- psalms 60:3
.
You have given a banner to those who fear You, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. -- psalms 60:4
.
That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and answer us! -- psalms 60:5
.
God has spoken in His holiness: "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth. -- psalms 60:6
.
"Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter. -- psalms 60:7
.
"Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me!" -- psalms 60:8
.
Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom? -- psalms 60:9
.
Have not You Yourself, O God, rejected us? And will You not go forth with our armies, O God? -- psalms 60:10
.
O give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain. -- psalms 60:11
.
Through God we shall do valiantly, And it is He who will tread down our adversaries. -- psalms 60:12
.
Hear my cry, O God; Give heed to my prayer. -- psalms 61:1
.
From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. -- psalms 61:2
.
For You have been a refuge for me, A tower of strength against the enemy. -- psalms 61:3
.
Let me dwell in Your tent forever; Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah. -- psalms 61:4
.
For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name. -- psalms 61:5
.
You will prolong the king's life; His years will be as many generations. -- psalms 61:6
.
He will abide before God forever; Appoint lovingkindness and truth that they may preserve him. -- psalms 61:7
.
So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may pay my vows day by day. -- psalms 61:8
.
My soul waits in silence for God only; From Him is my salvation. -- psalms 62:1
.
He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken. -- psalms 62:2
.
How long will you assail a man, That you may murder him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? -- psalms 62:3
.
They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouth, But inwardly they curse. Selah. -- psalms 62:4
.
My soul, wait in silence for God only, For my hope is from Him. -- psalms 62:5
.
He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be shaken. -- psalms 62:6
.
On God my salvation and my glory rest; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God. -- psalms 62:7
.
Trust in Him at all times, O people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah. -- psalms 62:8
.
Men of low degree are only vanity and men of rank are a lie; In the balances they go up; They are together lighter than breath. -- psalms 62:9
.
Do not trust in oppression And do not vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, do not set your heart upon them. -- psalms 62:10
.
Once God has spoken; Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God; -- psalms 62:11
.
And lovingkindness is Yours, O Lord, For You recompense a man according to his work. -- psalms 62:12
.
O God, You are my God; I shall seek You earnestly; My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You, In a dry and weary land where there is no water. -- psalms 63:1
.
Thus I have seen You in the sanctuary, To see Your power and Your glory. -- psalms 63:2
.
Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, My lips will praise You. -- psalms 63:3
.
So I will bless You as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name. -- psalms 63:4
.
My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips. -- psalms 63:5
.
When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches, -- psalms 63:6
.
For You have been my help, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy. -- psalms 63:7
.
My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me. -- psalms 63:8
.
But those who seek my life to destroy it, Will go into the depths of the earth. -- psalms 63:9
.
They will be delivered over to the power of the sword; They will be a prey for foxes. -- psalms 63:10
.
But the king will rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him will glory, For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped. -- psalms 63:11
.
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from dread of the enemy. -- psalms 64:1
.
Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of those who do iniquity, -- psalms 64:2
.
Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword. They aimed bitter speech as their arrow, -- psalms 64:3
.
To shoot from concealment at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear. -- psalms 64:4
.
They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who can see them?" -- psalms 64:5
.
They devise injustices, saying, "We are ready with a well-conceived plot"; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep. -- psalms 64:6
.
But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded. -- psalms 64:7
.
So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake the head. -- psalms 64:8
.
Then all men will fear, And they will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done. -- psalms 64:9
.
The righteous man will be glad in the LORD and will take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will glory. -- psalms 64:10
.
There will be silence before You, and praise in Zion, O God, And to You the vow will be performed. -- psalms 65:1
.
O You who hear prayer, To You all men come. -- psalms 65:2
.
Iniquities prevail against me; As for our transgressions, You forgive them. -- psalms 65:3
.
How blessed is the one whom You choose and bring near to You To dwell in Your courts. We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your holy temple. -- psalms 65:4
.
By awesome deeds You answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, You who are the trust of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest sea; -- psalms 65:5
.
Who establishes the mountains by His strength, Being girded with might; -- psalms 65:6
.
Who stills the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples. -- psalms 65:7
.
They who dwell in the ends of the earth stand in awe of Your signs; You make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy. -- psalms 65:8
.
You visit the earth and cause it to overflow; You greatly enrich it; The stream of God is full of water; You prepare their grain, for thus You prepare the earth. -- psalms 65:9
.
You water its furrows abundantly, You settle its ridges, You soften it with showers, You bless its growth. -- psalms 65:10
.
You have crowned the year with Your bounty, And Your paths drip with fatness. -- psalms 65:11
.
The pastures of the wilderness drip, And the hills gird themselves with rejoicing. -- psalms 65:12
.
The meadows are clothed with flocks And the valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy, yes, they sing. -- psalms 65:13
.
Shout joyfully to God, all the earth; -- psalms 66:1
.
Sing the glory of His name; Make His praise glorious. -- psalms 66:2
.
Say to God, "How awesome are Your works! Because of the greatness of Your power Your enemies will give feigned obedience to You. -- psalms 66:3
.
"All the earth will worship You, And will sing praises to You; They will sing praises to Your name." Selah. -- psalms 66:4
.
Come and see the works of God, Who is awesome in His deeds toward the sons of men. -- psalms 66:5
.
He turned the sea into dry land; They passed through the river on foot; There let us rejoice in Him! -- psalms 66:6
.
He rules by His might forever; His eyes keep watch on the nations; Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. -- psalms 66:7
.
Bless our God, O peoples, And sound His praise abroad, -- psalms 66:8
.
Who keeps us in life And does not allow our feet to slip. -- psalms 66:9
.
For You have tried us, O God; You have refined us as silver is refined. -- psalms 66:10
.
You brought us into the net; You laid an oppressive burden upon our loins. -- psalms 66:11
.
You made men ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water, Yet You brought us out into a place of abundance. -- psalms 66:12
.
I shall come into Your house with burnt offerings; I shall pay You my vows, -- psalms 66:13
.
Which my lips uttered And my mouth spoke when I was in distress. -- psalms 66:14
.
I shall offer to You burnt offerings of fat beasts, With the smoke of rams; I shall make an offering of bulls with male goats. Selah. -- psalms 66:15
.
Come and hear, all who fear God, And I will tell of what He has done for my soul. -- psalms 66:16
.
I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue. -- psalms 66:17
.
If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not hear; -- psalms 66:18
.
But certainly God has heard; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer. -- psalms 66:19
.
Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer Nor His lovingkindness from me. -- psalms 66:20
.
God be gracious to us and bless us, And cause His face to shine upon us-- Selah. -- psalms 67:1
.
That Your way may be known on the earth, Your salvation among all nations. -- psalms 67:2
.
Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You. -- psalms 67:3
.
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For You will judge the peoples with uprightness And guide the nations on the earth. Selah. -- psalms 67:4
.
Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You. -- psalms 67:5
.
The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God, blesses us. -- psalms 67:6
.
God blesses us, That all the ends of the earth may fear Him. -- psalms 67:7
.
Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered, And let those who hate Him flee before Him. -- psalms 68:1
.
As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; As wax melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish before God. -- psalms 68:2
.
But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God; Yes, let them rejoice with gladness. -- psalms 68:3
.
Sing to God, sing praises to His name; Lift up a song for Him who rides through the deserts, Whose name is the LORD, and exult before Him. -- psalms 68:4
.
A father of the fatherless and a judge for the widows, Is God in His holy habitation. -- psalms 68:5
.
God makes a home for the lonely; He leads out the prisoners into prosperity, Only the rebellious dwell in a parched land. -- psalms 68:6
.
O God, when You went forth before Your people, When You marched through the wilderness, Selah. -- psalms 68:7
.
The earth quaked; The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God; Sinai itself quaked at the presence of God, the God of Israel. -- psalms 68:8
.
You shed abroad a plentiful rain, O God; You confirmed Your inheritance when it was parched. -- psalms 68:9
.
Your creatures settled in it; You provided in Your goodness for the poor, O God. -- psalms 68:10
.
The Lord gives the command; The women who proclaim the good tidings are a great host: -- psalms 68:11
.
"Kings of armies flee, they flee, And she who remains at home will divide the spoil!" -- psalms 68:12
.
When you lie down among the sheepfolds, You are like the wings of a dove covered with silver, And its pinions with glistening gold. -- psalms 68:13
.
When the Almighty scattered the kings there, It was snowing in Zalmon. -- psalms 68:14
.
A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan. -- psalms 68:15
.
