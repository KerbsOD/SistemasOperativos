Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; -- hebrews 3:5
.
but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house--whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end. -- hebrews 3:6
.
Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, -- hebrews 3:7
.
DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME, AS IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS, -- hebrews 3:8
.
WHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED Me BY TESTING Me, AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS. -- hebrews 3:9
.
"THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION, AND SAID, 'THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART, AND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS'; -- hebrews 3:10
.
AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, 'THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.'" -- hebrews 3:11
.
Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. -- hebrews 3:12
.
But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called "Today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. -- hebrews 3:13
.
For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end, -- hebrews 3:14
.
while it is said, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME." -- hebrews 3:15
.
For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? -- hebrews 3:16
.
And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? -- hebrews 3:17
.
And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient? -- hebrews 3:18
.
So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief. -- hebrews 3:19
.
Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. -- hebrews 4:1
.
For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. -- hebrews 4:2
.
For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, "AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST," although His works were finished from the foundation of the world. -- hebrews 4:3
.
For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: "AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS"; -- hebrews 4:4
.
and again in this passage, "THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST." -- hebrews 4:5
.
Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience, -- hebrews 4:6
.
He again fixes a certain day, "Today," saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS." -- hebrews 4:7
.
For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that. -- hebrews 4:8
.
So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. -- hebrews 4:9
.
For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His. -- hebrews 4:10
.
Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience. -- hebrews 4:11
.
For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. -- hebrews 4:12
.
And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. -- hebrews 4:13
.
Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. -- hebrews 4:14
.
For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin. -- hebrews 4:15
.
Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. -- hebrews 4:16
.
For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; -- hebrews 5:1
.
he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness; -- hebrews 5:2
.
and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself. -- hebrews 5:3
.
And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was. -- hebrews 5:4
.
So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, "YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU"; -- hebrews 5:5
.
just as He says also in another passage, "YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK." -- hebrews 5:6
.
In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety. -- hebrews 5:7
.
Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. -- hebrews 5:8
.
And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation, -- hebrews 5:9
.
being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. -- hebrews 5:10
.
Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. -- hebrews 5:11
.
For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food. -- hebrews 5:12
.
For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant. -- hebrews 5:13
.
But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil. -- hebrews 5:14
.
Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, -- hebrews 6:1
.
of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment. -- hebrews 6:2
.
And this we will do, if God permits. -- hebrews 6:3
.
For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, -- hebrews 6:4
.
and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, -- hebrews 6:5
.
and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame. -- hebrews 6:6
.
For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God; -- hebrews 6:7
.
but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned. -- hebrews 6:8
.
But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way. -- hebrews 6:9
.
For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints. -- hebrews 6:10
.
And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, -- hebrews 6:11
.
so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. -- hebrews 6:12
.
For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself, -- hebrews 6:13
.
saying, "I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOU." -- hebrews 6:14
.
And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise. -- hebrews 6:15
.
For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute. -- hebrews 6:16
.
In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath, -- hebrews 6:17
.
so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us. -- hebrews 6:18
.
This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil, -- hebrews 6:19
.
where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. -- hebrews 6:20
.
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, -- hebrews 7:1
.
to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. -- hebrews 7:2
.
Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually. -- hebrews 7:3
.
Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. -- hebrews 7:4
.
And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. -- hebrews 7:5
.
But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. -- hebrews 7:6
.
But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. -- hebrews 7:7
.
In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. -- hebrews 7:8
.
And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, -- hebrews 7:9
.
for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. -- hebrews 7:10
.
Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? -- hebrews 7:11
.
For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. -- hebrews 7:12
.
For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. -- hebrews 7:13
.
For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. -- hebrews 7:14
.
And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, -- hebrews 7:15
.
who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. -- hebrews 7:16
.
For it is attested of Him, "YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK." -- hebrews 7:17
.
For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness -- hebrews 7:18
.
(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. -- hebrews 7:19
.
And inasmuch as it was not without an oath -- hebrews 7:20
.
(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, "THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, 'YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER'"); -- hebrews 7:21
.
so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. -- hebrews 7:22
.
The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, -- hebrews 7:23
.
but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. -- hebrews 7:24
.
Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. -- hebrews 7:25
.
For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; -- hebrews 7:26
.
who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. -- hebrews 7:27
.
For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever. -- hebrews 7:28
.
Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, -- hebrews 8:1
.
a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. -- hebrews 8:2
.
For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer. -- hebrews 8:3
.
Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law; -- hebrews 8:4
.
who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "SEE," He says, "THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN." -- hebrews 8:5
.
But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises. -- hebrews 8:6
.
For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second. -- hebrews 8:7
.
For finding fault with them, He says, "BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD, WHEN I WILL EFFECT A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH; -- hebrews 8:8
.
NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT, AND I DID NOT CARE FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD. -- hebrews 8:9
.
"FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS, AND I WILL WRITE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS. AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE. -- hebrews 8:10
.
"AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH EVERYONE HIS FELLOW CITIZEN, AND EVERYONE HIS BROTHER, SAYING, 'KNOW THE LORD,' FOR ALL WILL KNOW ME, FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM. -- hebrews 8:11
.
"FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO THEIR INIQUITIES, AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS NO MORE." -- hebrews 8:12
.
When He said, "A new covenant," He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear. -- hebrews 8:13
.
Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary. -- hebrews 9:1
.
For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place. -- hebrews 9:2
.
Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, -- hebrews 9:3
.
having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant; -- hebrews 9:4
.
and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail. -- hebrews 9:5
.
Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship, -- hebrews 9:6
.
but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance. -- hebrews 9:7
.
The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing, -- hebrews 9:8
.
which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience, -- hebrews 9:9
.
since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation. -- hebrews 9:10
.
But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation; -- hebrews 9:11
.
and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. -- hebrews 9:12
.
For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, -- hebrews 9:13
.
how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? -- hebrews 9:14
.
For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. -- hebrews 9:15
.
For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it. -- hebrews 9:16
.
For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives. -- hebrews 9:17
.
Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood. -- hebrews 9:18
.
For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, -- hebrews 9:19
.
saying, "THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU." -- hebrews 9:20
.
And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood. -- hebrews 9:21
.
And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. -- hebrews 9:22
.
Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. -- hebrews 9:23
.
For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; -- hebrews 9:24
.
nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own. -- hebrews 9:25
.
Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. -- hebrews 9:26
.
And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment, -- hebrews 9:27
.
so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him. -- hebrews 9:28
.
For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near. -- hebrews 10:1
.
Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins? -- hebrews 10:2
.
But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year. -- hebrews 10:3
.
For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. -- hebrews 10:4
.
Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, "SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME; -- hebrews 10:5
.
IN WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE. -- hebrews 10:6
.
"THEN I SAID, 'BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.'" -- hebrews 10:7
.
After saying above, "SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE in them" (which are offered according to the Law), -- hebrews 10:8
.
then He said, "BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL." He takes away the first in order to establish the second. -- hebrews 10:9
.
By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. -- hebrews 10:10
.
Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; -- hebrews 10:11
.
but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, -- hebrews 10:12
.
waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. -- hebrews 10:13
.
For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. -- hebrews 10:14
.
And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, -- hebrews 10:15
.
"THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM," He then says, -- hebrews 10:16
.
"AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE." -- hebrews 10:17
.
Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin. -- hebrews 10:18
.
Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, -- hebrews 10:19
.
by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh, -- hebrews 10:20
.
and since we have a great priest over the house of God, -- hebrews 10:21
.
let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. -- hebrews 10:22
.
Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; -- hebrews 10:23
.
and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, -- hebrews 10:24
.
not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near. -- hebrews 10:25
.
For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, -- hebrews 10:26
.
but a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES. -- hebrews 10:27
.
Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. -- hebrews 10:28
.
How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? -- hebrews 10:29
.
For we know Him who said, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY." And again, "THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE." -- hebrews 10:30
.
It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God. -- hebrews 10:31
.
But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings, -- hebrews 10:32
.
partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated. -- hebrews 10:33
.
For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one. -- hebrews 10:34
.
Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. -- hebrews 10:35
.
For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised. -- hebrews 10:36
.
FOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE, HE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY. -- hebrews 10:37
.
BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH; AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM. -- hebrews 10:38
.
But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul. -- hebrews 10:39
.
Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. -- hebrews 11:1
.
For by it the men of old gained approval. -- hebrews 11:2
.
By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. -- hebrews 11:3
.
By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. -- hebrews 11:4
.
By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. -- hebrews 11:5
.
And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. -- hebrews 11:6
.
By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. -- hebrews 11:7
.
By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. -- hebrews 11:8
.
By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; -- hebrews 11:9
.
for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. -- hebrews 11:10
.
By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. -- hebrews 11:11
.
Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN IN NUMBER, AND INNUMERABLE AS THE SAND WHICH IS BY THE SEASHORE. -- hebrews 11:12
.
All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. -- hebrews 11:13
.
For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. -- hebrews 11:14
.
And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. -- hebrews 11:15
.
But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them. -- hebrews 11:16
.
By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; -- hebrews 11:17
.
it was he to whom it was said, "IN ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE CALLED." -- hebrews 11:18
.
He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. -- hebrews 11:19
.
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. -- hebrews 11:20
.
By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. -- hebrews 11:21
.
By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones. -- hebrews 11:22
.
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's edict. -- hebrews 11:23
.
By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, -- hebrews 11:24
.
choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, -- hebrews 11:25
.
considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. -- hebrews 11:26
.
By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. -- hebrews 11:27
.
By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. -- hebrews 11:28
.
By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned. -- hebrews 11:29
.
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. -- hebrews 11:30
.
By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace. -- hebrews 11:31
.
And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, -- hebrews 11:32
.
who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, -- hebrews 11:33
.
quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. -- hebrews 11:34
.
Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; -- hebrews 11:35
.
and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. -- hebrews 11:36
.
They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated -- hebrews 11:37
.
(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground. -- hebrews 11:38
.
And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, -- hebrews 11:39
.
because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect. -- hebrews 11:40
.
Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, -- hebrews 12:1
.
fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. -- hebrews 12:2
.
For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. -- hebrews 12:3
.
You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin; -- hebrews 12:4
.
and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, "MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM; -- hebrews 12:5
.
FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES." -- hebrews 12:6
.
It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? -- hebrews 12:7
.
But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. -- hebrews 12:8
.
Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? -- hebrews 12:9
.
For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness. -- hebrews 12:10
.
All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. -- hebrews 12:11
.
Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble, -- hebrews 12:12
.
and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed. -- hebrews 12:13
.
Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord. -- hebrews 12:14
.
See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled; -- hebrews 12:15
.
that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal. -- hebrews 12:16
.
For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears. -- hebrews 12:17
.
For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind, -- hebrews 12:18
.
and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them. -- hebrews 12:19
.
For they could not bear the command, "IF EVEN A BEAST TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN, IT WILL BE STONED." -- hebrews 12:20
.
And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, "I AM FULL OF FEAR and trembling." -- hebrews 12:21
.
But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, -- hebrews 12:22
.
to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, -- hebrews 12:23
.
and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel. -- hebrews 12:24
.
See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven. -- hebrews 12:25
.
And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, "YET ONCE MORE I WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH, BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN." -- hebrews 12:26
.
This expression, "Yet once more," denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. -- hebrews 12:27
.
Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe; -- hebrews 12:28
.
for our God is a consuming fire. -- hebrews 12:29
.
Let love of the brethren continue. -- hebrews 13:1
.
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it. -- hebrews 13:2
.
Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves also are in the body. -- hebrews 13:3
.
Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge. -- hebrews 13:4
.
Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, "I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU," -- hebrews 13:5
.
so that we confidently say, "THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO ME?" -- hebrews 13:6
.
Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith. -- hebrews 13:7
.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. -- hebrews 13:8
.
Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited. -- hebrews 13:9
.
We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. -- hebrews 13:10
.
For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp. -- hebrews 13:11
.
Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate. -- hebrews 13:12
.
So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. -- hebrews 13:13
.
For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come. -- hebrews 13:14
.
Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name. -- hebrews 13:15
.
And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased. -- hebrews 13:16
.
Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you. -- hebrews 13:17
.
Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things. -- hebrews 13:18
.
And I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you the sooner. -- hebrews 13:19
.
Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord, -- hebrews 13:20
.
equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. -- hebrews 13:21
.
But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly. -- hebrews 13:22
.
Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you. -- hebrews 13:23
.
Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you. -- hebrews 13:24
.
Grace be with you all. -- hebrews 13:25
.
James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings. -- james 1:1
.
Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, -- james 1:2
.
knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. -- james 1:3
.
And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. -- james 1:4
.
But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. -- james 1:5
.
But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. -- james 1:6
.
For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, -- james 1:7
.
being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. -- james 1:8
.
But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position; -- james 1:9
.
and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. -- james 1:10
.
For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away. -- james 1:11
.
Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. -- james 1:12
.
Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. -- james 1:13
.
But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. -- james 1:14
.
Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. -- james 1:15
.
Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. -- james 1:16
.
Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow. -- james 1:17
.
In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures. -- james 1:18
.
This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger; -- james 1:19
.
for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. -- james 1:20
.
Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls. -- james 1:21
.
But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves. -- james 1:22
.
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; -- james 1:23
.
for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was. -- james 1:24
.
But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does. -- james 1:25
.
If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless. -- james 1:26
.
Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world. -- james 1:27
.
My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism. -- james 2:1
.
For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes, -- james 2:2
.
and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, "You sit here in a good place," and you say to the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool," -- james 2:3
.
have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives? -- james 2:4
.
Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? -- james 2:5
.
But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court? -- james 2:6
.
Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called? -- james 2:7
.
If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF," you are doing well. -- james 2:8
.
But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. -- james 2:9
.
For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. -- james 2:10
.
For He who said, "DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY," also said, "DO NOT COMMIT MURDER." Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. -- james 2:11
.
So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty. -- james 2:12
.
For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment. -- james 2:13
.
What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? -- james 2:14
.
If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, -- james 2:15
.
and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and be filled," and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? -- james 2:16
.
Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself. -- james 2:17
.
But someone may well say, "You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works." -- james 2:18
.
You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. -- james 2:19
.
But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? -- james 2:20
.
Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? -- james 2:21
.
You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; -- james 2:22
.
and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS," and he was called the friend of God. -- james 2:23
.
You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. -- james 2:24
.
In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? -- james 2:25
.
For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. -- james 2:26
.
Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment. -- james 3:1
.
For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well. -- james 3:2
.
Now if we put the bits into the horses' mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well. -- james 3:3
.
Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires. -- james 3:4
.
So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire! -- james 3:5
.
And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell. -- james 3:6
.
For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race. -- james 3:7
.
But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison. -- james 3:8
.
With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God; -- james 3:9
.
from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way. -- james 3:10
.
Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? -- james 3:11
.
Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh. -- james 3:12
.
Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. -- james 3:13
.
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. -- james 3:14
.
This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. -- james 3:15
.
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. -- james 3:16
.
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. -- james 3:17
.
And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. -- james 3:18
.
What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? -- james 4:1
.
You lust and do not have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. -- james 4:2
.
You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. -- james 4:3
.
You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. -- james 4:4
.
Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: "He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us"? -- james 4:5
.
But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, "GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE." -- james 4:6
.
Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. -- james 4:7
.
Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. -- james 4:8
.
Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom. -- james 4:9
.
Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you. -- james 4:10
.
Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it. -- james 4:11
.
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor? -- james 4:12
.
Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit." -- james 4:13
.
Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away. -- james 4:14
.
Instead, you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that." -- james 4:15
.
But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil. -- james 4:16
.
Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin. -- james 4:17
.
Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you. -- james 5:1
.
Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten. -- james 5:2
.
Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure! -- james 5:3
.
Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. -- james 5:4
.
You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. -- james 5:5
.
You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does not resist you. -- james 5:6
.
Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains. -- james 5:7
.
You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. -- james 5:8
.
Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door. -- james 5:9
.
As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. -- james 5:10
.
We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful. -- james 5:11
.
But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment. -- james 5:12
.
Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises. -- james 5:13
.
Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; -- james 5:14
.
and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him. -- james 5:15
.
Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much. -- james 5:16
.
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. -- james 5:17
.
Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit. -- james 5:18
.
My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back, -- james 5:19
.
let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins. -- james 5:20
.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen -- 1 peter 1:1
.
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. -- 1 peter 1:2
.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, -- 1 peter 1:3
.
to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, -- 1 peter 1:4
.
who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. -- 1 peter 1:5
.
In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, -- 1 peter 1:6
.
so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; -- 1 peter 1:7
.
and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, -- 1 peter 1:8
.
obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. -- 1 peter 1:9
.
As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, -- 1 peter 1:10
.
seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. -- 1 peter 1:11
.
It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven--things into which angels long to look. -- 1 peter 1:12
.
Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. -- 1 peter 1:13
.
As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, -- 1 peter 1:14
.
but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; -- 1 peter 1:15
.
because it is written, "YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY." -- 1 peter 1:16
.
If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; -- 1 peter 1:17
.
knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, -- 1 peter 1:18
.
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. -- 1 peter 1:19
.
For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you -- 1 peter 1:20
.
who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. -- 1 peter 1:21
.
Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, -- 1 peter 1:22
.
for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. -- 1 peter 1:23
.
For, "ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, -- 1 peter 1:24
.
BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER." And this is the word which was preached to you. -- 1 peter 1:25
.
Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, -- 1 peter 2:1
.
like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, -- 1 peter 2:2
.
if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. -- 1 peter 2:3
.
And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, -- 1 peter 2:4
.
you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. -- 1 peter 2:5
.
For this is contained in Scripture: "BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED." -- 1 peter 2:6
.
This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, "THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone," -- 1 peter 2:7
.
and, "A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE"; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. -- 1 peter 2:8
.
But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; -- 1 peter 2:9
.
for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY. -- 1 peter 2:10
.
Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. -- 1 peter 2:11
.
Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation. -- 1 peter 2:12
.
Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, -- 1 peter 2:13
.
or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. -- 1 peter 2:14
.
For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. -- 1 peter 2:15
.
Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God. -- 1 peter 2:16
.
Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. -- 1 peter 2:17
.
Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. -- 1 peter 2:18
.
For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. -- 1 peter 2:19
.
For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God. -- 1 peter 2:20
.
For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, -- 1 peter 2:21
.
WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH; -- 1 peter 2:22
.
and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously; -- 1 peter 2:23
.
and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed. -- 1 peter 2:24
.
For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls. -- 1 peter 2:25
.
In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, -- 1 peter 3:1
.
as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior. -- 1 peter 3:2
.
Your adornment must not be merely external--braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; -- 1 peter 3:3
.
but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. -- 1 peter 3:4
.
For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands; -- 1 peter 3:5
.
just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear. -- 1 peter 3:6
.
You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. -- 1 peter 3:7
.
To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit; -- 1 peter 3:8
.
not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. -- 1 peter 3:9
.
For, "THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT. -- 1 peter 3:10
.
"HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT. -- 1 peter 3:11
.
"FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL." -- 1 peter 3:12
.
Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? -- 1 peter 3:13
.
But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED, -- 1 peter 3:14
.
but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; -- 1 peter 3:15
.
and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. -- 1 peter 3:16
.
For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong. -- 1 peter 3:17
.
For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; -- 1 peter 3:18
.
in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, -- 1 peter 3:19
.
who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water. -- 1 peter 3:20
.
Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you--not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, -- 1 peter 3:21
.
who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him. -- 1 peter 3:22
.
Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, -- 1 peter 4:1
.
so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. -- 1 peter 4:2
.
For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries. -- 1 peter 4:3
.
In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you; -- 1 peter 4:4
.
but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. -- 1 peter 4:5
.
For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God. -- 1 peter 4:6
.
The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer. -- 1 peter 4:7
.
Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. -- 1 peter 4:8
.
Be hospitable to one another without complaint. -- 1 peter 4:9
.
As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. -- 1 peter 4:10
.
Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. -- 1 peter 4:11
.
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; -- 1 peter 4:12
.
but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation. -- 1 peter 4:13
.
If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. -- 1 peter 4:14
.
Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; -- 1 peter 4:15
.
but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name. -- 1 peter 4:16
.
For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? -- 1 peter 4:17
.
AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER? -- 1 peter 4:18
.
Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right. -- 1 peter 4:19
.
Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, -- 1 peter 5:1
.
shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; -- 1 peter 5:2
.
nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. -- 1 peter 5:3
.
And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. -- 1 peter 5:4
.
You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE. -- 1 peter 5:5
.
Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, -- 1 peter 5:6
.
casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. -- 1 peter 5:7
.
Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. -- 1 peter 5:8
.
But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. -- 1 peter 5:9
.
After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. -- 1 peter 5:10
.
To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen. -- 1 peter 5:11
.
Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! -- 1 peter 5:12
.
She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. -- 1 peter 5:13
.
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ. -- 1 peter 5:14
.
Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ: -- 2 peter 1:1
.
Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; -- 2 peter 1:2
.
seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence. -- 2 peter 1:3
.
For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust. -- 2 peter 1:4
.
Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence, knowledge, -- 2 peter 1:5
.
and in your knowledge, self-control, and in your self-control, perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness, -- 2 peter 1:6
.
and in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, love. -- 2 peter 1:7
.
For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 2 peter 1:8
.
For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins. -- 2 peter 1:9
.
Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble; -- 2 peter 1:10
.
for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you. -- 2 peter 1:11
.
Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you already know them, and have been established in the truth which is present with you. -- 2 peter 1:12
.
I consider it right, as long as I am in this earthly dwelling, to stir you up by way of reminder, -- 2 peter 1:13
.
knowing that the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. -- 2 peter 1:14
.
And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call these things to mind. -- 2 peter 1:15
.
For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. -- 2 peter 1:16
.
For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, "This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased"-- -- 2 peter 1:17
.
and we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. -- 2 peter 1:18
.
So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts. -- 2 peter 1:19
.
But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, -- 2 peter 1:20
.
for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. -- 2 peter 1:21
.
But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves. -- 2 peter 2:1
.
Many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned; -- 2 peter 2:2
.
and in their greed they will exploit you with false words; their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep. -- 2 peter 2:3
.
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment; -- 2 peter 2:4
.
and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; -- 2 peter 2:5
.
and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter; -- 2 peter 2:6
.
and if He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men -- 2 peter 2:7
.
(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds), -- 2 peter 2:8
.
then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment, -- 2 peter 2:9
.
and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties, -- 2 peter 2:10
.
whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord. -- 2 peter 2:11
.
But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed, -- 2 peter 2:12
.
suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you, -- 2 peter 2:13
.
having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children; -- 2 peter 2:14
.
forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; -- 2 peter 2:15
.
but he received a rebuke for his own transgression, for a mute donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet. -- 2 peter 2:16
.
These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black darkness has been reserved. -- 2 peter 2:17
.
For speaking out arrogant words of vanity they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error, -- 2 peter 2:18
.
promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved. -- 2 peter 2:19
.
For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. -- 2 peter 2:20
.
For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them. -- 2 peter 2:21
.
It has happened to them according to the true proverb, "A DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT," and, "A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mire." -- 2 peter 2:22
.
This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder, -- 2 peter 3:1
.
that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles. -- 2 peter 3:2
.
Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts, -- 2 peter 3:3
.
and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation." -- 2 peter 3:4
.
For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water, -- 2 peter 3:5
.
through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water. -- 2 peter 3:6
.
But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. -- 2 peter 3:7
.
But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. -- 2 peter 3:8
.
The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance. -- 2 peter 3:9
.
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up. -- 2 peter 3:10
.
Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, -- 2 peter 3:11
.
looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat! -- 2 peter 3:12
.
But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells. -- 2 peter 3:13
.
Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless, -- 2 peter 3:14
.
and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you, -- 2 peter 3:15
.
as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. -- 2 peter 3:16
.
You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and fall from your own steadfastness, -- 2 peter 3:17
.
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen. -- 2 peter 3:18
.
What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life-- -- 1 john 1:1
.
and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us-- -- 1 john 1:2
.
what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. -- 1 john 1:3
.
These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete. -- 1 john 1:4
.
This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. -- 1 john 1:5
.
If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; -- 1 john 1:6
.
but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. -- 1 john 1:7
.
If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. -- 1 john 1:8
.
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. -- 1 john 1:9
.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. -- 1 john 1:10
.
My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; -- 1 john 2:1
.
and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. -- 1 john 2:2
.
By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. -- 1 john 2:3
.
The one who says, "I have come to know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; -- 1 john 2:4
.
but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him: -- 1 john 2:5
.
the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked. -- 1 john 2:6
.
Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard. -- 1 john 2:7
.
On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining. -- 1 john 2:8
.
The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now. -- 1 john 2:9
.
The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him. -- 1 john 2:10
.
But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. -- 1 john 2:11
.
I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name's sake. -- 1 john 2:12
.
I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father. -- 1 john 2:13
.
I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. -- 1 john 2:14
.
Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. -- 1 john 2:15
.
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. -- 1 john 2:16
.
The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever. -- 1 john 2:17
.
Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour. -- 1 john 2:18
.
They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, so that it would be shown that they all are not of us. -- 1 john 2:19
.
But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. -- 1 john 2:20
.
I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth. -- 1 john 2:21
.
Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. -- 1 john 2:22
.
Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. -- 1 john 2:23
.
As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. -- 1 john 2:24
.
This is the promise which He Himself made to us: eternal life. -- 1 john 2:25
.
These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. -- 1 john 2:26
.
As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him. -- 1 john 2:27
.
Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming. -- 1 john 2:28
.
If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him. -- 1 john 2:29
.
See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. -- 1 john 3:1
.
Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. -- 1 john 3:2
.
And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. -- 1 john 3:3
.
Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. -- 1 john 3:4
.
You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin. -- 1 john 3:5
.
No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. -- 1 john 3:6
.
Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; -- 1 john 3:7
.
the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. -- 1 john 3:8
.
No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. -- 1 john 3:9
.
By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother. -- 1 john 3:10
.
For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another; -- 1 john 3:11
.
not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother's were righteous. -- 1 john 3:12
.
Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you. -- 1 john 3:13
.
We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. -- 1 john 3:14
.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. -- 1 john 3:15
.
We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. -- 1 john 3:16
.
But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? -- 1 john 3:17
.
Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth. -- 1 john 3:18
.
We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before Him -- 1 john 3:19
.
in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things. -- 1 john 3:20
.
Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; -- 1 john 3:21
.
and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight. -- 1 john 3:22
.
This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us. -- 1 john 3:23
.
The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us. -- 1 john 3:24
.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. -- 1 john 4:1
.
By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; -- 1 john 4:2
.
and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. -- 1 john 4:3
.
You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. -- 1 john 4:4
.
They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them. -- 1 john 4:5
.
We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. -- 1 john 4:6
.
Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. -- 1 john 4:7
.
The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. -- 1 john 4:8
.
By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. -- 1 john 4:9
.
In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. -- 1 john 4:10
.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. -- 1 john 4:11
.
No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. -- 1 john 4:12
.
By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. -- 1 john 4:13
.
We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. -- 1 john 4:14
.
Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. -- 1 john 4:15
.
We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. -- 1 john 4:16
.
By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. -- 1 john 4:17
.
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. -- 1 john 4:18
.
We love, because He first loved us. -- 1 john 4:19
.
If someone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. -- 1 john 4:20
.
And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. -- 1 john 4:21
.
Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him. -- 1 john 5:1
.
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments. -- 1 john 5:2
.
For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome. -- 1 john 5:3
.
For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world--our faith. -- 1 john 5:4
.
Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? -- 1 john 5:5
.
This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. -- 1 john 5:6
.
For there are three that testify: -- 1 john 5:7
.
the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. -- 1 john 5:8
.
If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son. -- 1 john 5:9
.
The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. -- 1 john 5:10
.
And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. -- 1 john 5:11
.
He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. -- 1 john 5:12
.
These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. -- 1 john 5:13
.
This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. -- 1 john 5:14
.
And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him. -- 1 john 5:15
.
If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make request for this. -- 1 john 5:16
.
All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death. -- 1 john 5:17
.
We know that no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. -- 1 john 5:18
.
We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. -- 1 john 5:19
.
And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. -- 1 john 5:20
.
Little children, guard yourselves from idols. -- 1 john 5:21
.
The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth, -- 2 john 1:1
.
for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever: -- 2 john 1:2
.
Grace, mercy and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. -- 2 john 1:3
.
I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father. -- 2 john 1:4
.
Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. -- 2 john 1:5
.
And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. -- 2 john 1:6
.
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. -- 2 john 1:7
.
Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. -- 2 john 1:8
.
Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. -- 2 john 1:9
.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a greeting; -- 2 john 1:10
.
for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds. -- 2 john 1:11
.
Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that your joy may be made full. -- 2 john 1:12
.
The children of your chosen sister greet you. -- 2 john 1:13
.
The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. -- 3 john 1:1
.
Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers. -- 3 john 1:2
.
For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth. -- 3 john 1:3
.
I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth. -- 3 john 1:4
.
Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers; -- 3 john 1:5
.
and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. -- 3 john 1:6
.
For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. -- 3 john 1:7
.
Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth. -- 3 john 1:8
.
I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say. -- 3 john 1:9
.
For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church. -- 3 john 1:10
.
Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God. -- 3 john 1:11
.
Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true. -- 3 john 1:12
.
I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink; -- 3 john 1:13
.
but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face. -- 3 john 1:14
.
Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ: -- jude 1:1
.
May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you. -- jude 1:2
.
Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints. -- jude 1:3
.
For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. -- jude 1:4
.
Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe. -- jude 1:5
.
And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day, -- jude 1:6
.
just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire. -- jude 1:7
.
Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties. -- jude 1:8
.
But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!" -- jude 1:9
.
But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed. -- jude 1:10
.
Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah. -- jude 1:11
.
These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted; -- jude 1:12
.
wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever. -- jude 1:13
.
It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones, -- jude 1:14
.
to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him." -- jude 1:15
.
These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their own lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage. -- jude 1:16
.
But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- jude 1:17
.
that they were saying to you, "In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts." -- jude 1:18
.
These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit. -- jude 1:19
.
But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, -- jude 1:20
.
keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. -- jude 1:21
.
And have mercy on some, who are doubting; -- jude 1:22
.
save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh. -- jude 1:23
.
Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, -- jude 1:24
.
to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen. -- jude 1:25
.
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John, -- revelation 1:1
.
who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. -- revelation 1:2
.
Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near. -- revelation 1:3
.
John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, -- revelation 1:4
.
and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood-- -- revelation 1:5
.
and He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father--to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. -- revelation 1:6
.
BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen. -- revelation 1:7
.
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty." -- revelation 1:8
.
I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. -- revelation 1:9
.
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet, -- revelation 1:10
.
saying, "Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea." -- revelation 1:11
.
Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands; -- revelation 1:12
.
and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash. -- revelation 1:13
.
His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire. -- revelation 1:14
.
His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. -- revelation 1:15
.
In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength. -- revelation 1:16
.
When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, "Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, -- revelation 1:17
.
and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. -- revelation 1:18
.
"Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things. -- revelation 1:19
.
"As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. -- revelation 1:20
.
"To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, says this: -- revelation 2:1
.
'I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false; -- revelation 2:2
.
and you have perseverance and have endured for My name's sake, and have not grown weary. -- revelation 2:3
.
'But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. -- revelation 2:4
.
'Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place--unless you repent. -- revelation 2:5
.
'Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. -- revelation 2:6
.
'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.' -- revelation 2:7
.
"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life, says this: -- revelation 2:8
.
'I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. -- revelation 2:9
.
'Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. -- revelation 2:10
.
'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.' -- revelation 2:11
.
"And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: The One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this: -- revelation 2:12
.
'I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. -- revelation 2:13
.
'But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality. -- revelation 2:14
.
'So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. -- revelation 2:15
.
'Therefore repent; or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth. -- revelation 2:16
.
'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.' -- revelation 2:17
.
"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: The Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like burnished bronze, says this: -- revelation 2:18
.
'I know your deeds, and your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first. -- revelation 2:19
.
'But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. -- revelation 2:20
.
'I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality. -- revelation 2:21
.
'Behold, I will throw her on a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds. -- revelation 2:22
.
'And I will kill her children with pestilence, and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds. -- revelation 2:23
.
'But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them--I place no other burden on you. -- revelation 2:24
.
'Nevertheless what you have, hold fast until I come. -- revelation 2:25
.
'He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, TO HIM I WILL GIVE AUTHORITY OVER THE NATIONS; -- revelation 2:26
.
AND HE SHALL RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON, AS THE VESSELS OF THE POTTER ARE BROKEN TO PIECES, as I also have received authority from My Father; -- revelation 2:27

"To the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: 'I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead. -- revelation 3:1
.
'Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God. -- revelation 3:2

.
"To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God, says this: -- revelation 3:14
.
'I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. -- revelation 3:15
.
'So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth. -- revelation 3:16
.
'Because you say, "I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing," and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked, -- revelation 3:17
.
I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see. -- revelation 3:18
.
'Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent. -- revelation 3:19

.
'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'" -- revelation 3:22
.
After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things." -- revelation 4:1
.
Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne. -- revelation 4:2
.
And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance. -- revelation 4:3
.
Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads. -- revelation 4:4
.
Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God; -- revelation 4:5
.
and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind. -- revelation 4:6
.
The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. -- revelation 4:7
.
And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME." -- revelation 4:8
.
And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, -- revelation 4:9
.
the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying, -- revelation 4:10
.
"Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created." -- revelation 4:11
.
I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. -- revelation 5:1
.
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?" -- revelation 5:2
.
And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it. -- revelation 5:3
.
Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it; -- revelation 5:4
.
and one of the elders *said to me, "Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals." -- revelation 5:5
.
And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth. -- revelation 5:6
.
And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. -- revelation 5:7
.
When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. -- revelation 5:8
.
And they *sang a new song, saying, "Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. -- revelation 5:9
.
"You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth." -- revelation 5:10
.
Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands, -- revelation 5:11
.
saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing." -- revelation 5:12
.
And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, "To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever." -- revelation 5:13
.
And the four living creatures kept saying, "Amen." And the elders fell down and worshiped. -- revelation 5:14
.
Then I saw when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, "Come." -- revelation 6:1
.
I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer. -- revelation 6:2
.
When He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come." -- revelation 6:3
.
And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him. -- revelation 6:4
.
When He broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come." I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. -- revelation 6:5
.
And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine." -- revelation 6:6
.
When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, "Come." -- revelation 6:7
.
I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth. -- revelation 6:8
.
When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained; -- revelation 6:9
.
and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" -- revelation 6:10
.
And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been, would be completed also. -- revelation 6:11
.
I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood; -- revelation 6:12
.
and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind. -- revelation 6:13
.
The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. -- revelation 6:14
.
Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains; -- revelation 6:15
.
and they *said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; -- revelation 6:16
.
for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?" -- revelation 6:17
.
After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree. -- revelation 7:1
.
And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, -- revelation 7:2
.
saying, "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads." -- revelation 7:3
.
And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel: -- revelation 7:4
.
from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand, -- revelation 7:5
.
from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand, -- revelation 7:6
.
from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand, -- revelation 7:7
.
from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed. -- revelation 7:8
.
After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches were in their hands; -- revelation 7:9
.
and they cry out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb." -- revelation 7:10
.
And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, -- revelation 7:11
.
saying, "Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen." -- revelation 7:12
.
Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?" -- revelation 7:13
.
I said to him, "My lord, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. -- revelation 7:14
.
"For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them. -- revelation 7:15
.
"They will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore; nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat; -- revelation 7:16
.
for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of the water of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes." -- revelation 7:17
.
When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. -- revelation 8:1
.
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. -- revelation 8:2
.
Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne. -- revelation 8:3
.
And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand. -- revelation 8:4
.
Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake. -- revelation 8:5
.
And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them. -- revelation 8:6
.
The first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. -- revelation 8:7
.
The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood, -- revelation 8:8
.
and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed. -- revelation 8:9
.
The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters. -- revelation 8:10
.
The name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter. -- revelation 8:11
.
The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way. -- revelation 8:12
.
Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!" -- revelation 8:13
.
Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him. -- revelation 9:1
.
He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. -- revelation 9:2
.
Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. -- revelation 9:3
.
They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. -- revelation 9:4
.
And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man. -- revelation 9:5
.
And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them. -- revelation 9:6
.
The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men. -- revelation 9:7
.
They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions. -- revelation 9:8
.
They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle. -- revelation 9:9
.
They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months. -- revelation 9:10
.
They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon. -- revelation 9:11
.
The first woe is past; behold, two woes are still coming after these things. -- revelation 9:12
.
Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, -- revelation 9:13
.
one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates." -- revelation 9:14
.
And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind. -- revelation 9:15
.
The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them. -- revelation 9:16
.
And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: the riders had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone. -- revelation 9:17
.
A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths. -- revelation 9:18
.
For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm. -- revelation 9:19
.
The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk; -- revelation 9:20
.
and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts. -- revelation 9:21
.
I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire; -- revelation 10:1
.
and he had in his hand a little book which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land; -- revelation 10:2
.
and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices. -- revelation 10:3
.
When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them." -- revelation 10:4
.
Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven, -- revelation 10:5
.
and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there will be delay no longer, -- revelation 10:6
.
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets. -- revelation 10:7
.
Then the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land." -- revelation 10:8
.
So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he *said to me, "Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey." -- revelation 10:9
.
I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. -- revelation 10:10
.
And they *said to me, "You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." -- revelation 10:11
.
Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, "Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it. -- revelation 11:1
.
"Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months. -- revelation 11:2
.
"And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth." -- revelation 11:3
.
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. -- revelation 11:4
.
And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. -- revelation 11:5
.
These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. -- revelation 11:6
.
When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them. -- revelation 11:7
.
And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. -- revelation 11:8
.
Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. -- revelation 11:9
.
And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth. -- revelation 11:10
.
But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them. -- revelation 11:11
.
And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them. -- revelation 11:12
.
And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. -- revelation 11:13
.
The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly. -- revelation 11:14
.
Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever." -- revelation 11:15
.
And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, -- revelation 11:16
.
saying, "We give You thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who are and who were, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign. -- revelation 11:17
.
"And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth." -- revelation 11:18
.
And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm. -- revelation 11:19
.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; -- revelation 12:1
.
and she was with child; and she *cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth. -- revelation 12:2
.
Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems. -- revelation 12:3
.
And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child. -- revelation 12:4
.
And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne. -- revelation 12:5
.
Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days. -- revelation 12:6
.
And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, -- revelation 12:7
.
and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. -- revelation 12:8
.
And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. -- revelation 12:9
.
Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night. -- revelation 12:10
.
"And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death. -- revelation 12:11
.
"For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time." -- revelation 12:12
.
And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child. -- revelation 12:13
.
But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. -- revelation 12:14
.
And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood. -- revelation 12:15
.
But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth. -- revelation 12:16
.
So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus. -- revelation 12:17
.
And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names. -- revelation 13:1
.
And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. -- revelation 13:2
.
I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast; -- revelation 13:3
.
they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?" -- revelation 13:4
.
There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him. -- revelation 13:5
.
And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven. -- revelation 13:6
.
It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him. -- revelation 13:7
.
All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain. -- revelation 13:8
.
If anyone has an ear, let him hear. -- revelation 13:9
.
If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints. -- revelation 13:10
.
Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon. -- revelation 13:11
.
He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. -- revelation 13:12
.
He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men. -- revelation 13:13
.
And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life. -- revelation 13:14
.
And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed. -- revelation 13:15
.
And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, -- revelation 13:16
.
and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name. -- revelation 13:17
.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. -- revelation 13:18
.
Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. -- revelation 14:1
.
And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps. -- revelation 14:2
.
And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth. -- revelation 14:3
.
These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb. -- revelation 14:4
.
And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless. -- revelation 14:5
.
And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people; -- revelation 14:6
.
and he said with a loud voice, "Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters." -- revelation 14:7
.
And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality." -- revelation 14:8
.
Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, -- revelation 14:9
.
he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. -- revelation 14:10
.
"And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name." -- revelation 14:11
.
Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus. -- revelation 14:12
.
And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!'" "Yes," says the Spirit, "so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them." -- revelation 14:13
.
Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand. -- revelation 14:14
.
And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe." -- revelation 14:15
.
Then He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped. -- revelation 14:16
.
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. -- revelation 14:17
.
Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe." -- revelation 14:18
.
So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God. -- revelation 14:19
.
And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses' bridles, for a distance of two hundred miles. -- revelation 14:20
.
Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished. -- revelation 15:1
.
And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God. -- revelation 15:2
.
And they *sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations! -- revelation 15:3
.
"Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; For ALL THE NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU, FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED." -- revelation 15:4
.
After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened, -- revelation 15:5
.
and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes. -- revelation 15:6
.
Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. -- revelation 15:7
.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. -- revelation 15:8
.
Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God." -- revelation 16:1
.
So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image. -- revelation 16:2
.
The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died. -- revelation 16:3
.
Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood. -- revelation 16:4
.
And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "Righteous are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things; -- revelation 16:5
.
for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it." -- revelation 16:6
.
And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments." -- revelation 16:7
.
The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire. -- revelation 16:8
.
Men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory. -- revelation 16:9
.
Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain, -- revelation 16:10
.
and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds. -- revelation 16:11
.
The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east. -- revelation 16:12
.
And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs; -- revelation 16:13
.
for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. -- revelation 16:14
.
("Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.") -- revelation 16:15
.
And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon. -- revelation 16:16
.
Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is done." -- revelation 16:17
.
And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty. -- revelation 16:18
.
The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath. -- revelation 16:19
.
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. -- revelation 16:20
.
And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, *came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague *was extremely severe. -- revelation 16:21
.
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters, -- revelation 17:1
.
with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality." -- revelation 17:2
.
And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns. -- revelation 17:3
.
The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality, -- revelation 17:4
.
and on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." -- revelation 17:5
.
And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly. -- revelation 17:6
.
And the angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. -- revelation 17:7
.
"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come. -- revelation 17:8
.
"Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits, -- revelation 17:9
.
and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while. -- revelation 17:10
.
"The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction. -- revelation 17:11
.
"The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour. -- revelation 17:12
.
"These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast. -- revelation 17:13
.
"These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful." -- revelation 17:14
.
And he *said to me, "The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. -- revelation 17:15
.
"And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire. -- revelation 17:16
.
"For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled. -- revelation 17:17
.
"The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth." -- revelation 17:18
.
After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory. -- revelation 18:1
.
And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird. -- revelation 18:2
.
"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality." -- revelation 18:3
.
I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues; -- revelation 18:4
.
for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. -- revelation 18:5
.
"Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back to her double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her. -- revelation 18:6
.
"To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, 'I SIT as A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.' -- revelation 18:7
.
"For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong. -- revelation 18:8
.
"And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning, -- revelation 18:9
.
standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.' -- revelation 18:10
.
"And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more-- -- revelation 18:11
.
cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble, -- revelation 18:12
.
and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargoes of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives. -- revelation 18:13
.
"The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and men will no longer find them. -- revelation 18:14
.
"The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, -- revelation 18:15
.
saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls; -- revelation 18:16
.
for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!' And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance, -- revelation 18:17
.
and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What city is like the great city?' -- revelation 18:18
.
"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!' -- revelation 18:19
.
"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her." -- revelation 18:20
.
Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer. -- revelation 18:21
.
"And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer; -- revelation 18:22
.
and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery. -- revelation 18:23
.
"And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth." -- revelation 18:24
.
After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God; -- revelation 19:1
.
BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her immorality, and HE HAS AVENGED THE BLOOD OF HIS BOND-SERVANTS ON HER." -- revelation 19:2
.
And a second time they said, "Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER." -- revelation 19:3
.
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, "Amen. Hallelujah!" -- revelation 19:4
.
And a voice came from the throne, saying, "Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants, you who fear Him, the small and the great." -- revelation 19:5
.
Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns. -- revelation 19:6
.
"Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready." -- revelation 19:7
.
It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. -- revelation 19:8
.
Then he *said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" And he *said to me, "These are true words of God." -- revelation 19:9
.
Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he *said to me, "Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." -- revelation 19:10
.
And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war. -- revelation 19:11
.
His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself. -- revelation 19:12
.
He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. -- revelation 19:13
.
And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses. -- revelation 19:14
.
From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty. -- revelation 19:15
.
And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS." -- revelation 19:16
.
Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, "Come, assemble for the great supper of God, -- revelation 19:17
.
so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great." -- revelation 19:18
.
And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army. -- revelation 19:19
.
And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone. -- revelation 19:20
.
And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh. -- revelation 19:21
.
Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. -- revelation 20:1
.
And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; -- revelation 20:2
.
and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time. -- revelation 20:3
.
Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. -- revelation 20:4
.
The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. -- revelation 20:5
.
Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years. -- revelation 20:6
.
When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, -- revelation 20:7
.
and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. -- revelation 20:8
.
And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. -- revelation 20:9
.
And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. -- revelation 20:10
.
Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. -- revelation 20:11
.
And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds. -- revelation 20:12
.
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds. -- revelation 20:13
.
Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. -- revelation 20:14
.
And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. -- revelation 20:15
.
Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea. -- revelation 21:1
.
And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. -- revelation 21:2
.
And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them, -- revelation 21:3
.
and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away." -- revelation 21:4
.
And He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He *said, "Write, for these words are faithful and true." -- revelation 21:5
.
Then He said to me, "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost. -- revelation 21:6
.
"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. -- revelation 21:7
.
"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." -- revelation 21:8
.
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." -- revelation 21:9
.
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, -- revelation 21:10
.
having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper. -- revelation 21:11
.
It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names were written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. -- revelation 21:12
.
There were three gates on the east and three gates on the north and three gates on the south and three gates on the west. -- revelation 21:13
.
And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. -- revelation 21:14
.
The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall. -- revelation 21:15
.
The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal. -- revelation 21:16
.
And he measured its wall, seventy-two yards, according to human measurements, which are also angelic measurements. -- revelation 21:17
.
The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass. -- revelation 21:18
.
The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; -- revelation 21:19
.
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. -- revelation 21:20
.
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. -- revelation 21:21
.
I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. -- revelation 21:22
.
And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb. -- revelation 21:23
.
The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. -- revelation 21:24
.
In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed; -- revelation 21:25
.
and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it; -- revelation 21:26
.
and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life. -- revelation 21:27
.
Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb, -- revelation 22:1
.
in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. -- revelation 22:2
.
There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him; -- revelation 22:3
.
they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. -- revelation 22:4
.
And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever. -- revelation 22:5
.
And he said to me, "These words are faithful and true"; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place. -- revelation 22:6
.
"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book." -- revelation 22:7
.
I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things. -- revelation 22:8
.
But he *said to me, "Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book. Worship God." -- revelation 22:9
.
And he *said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. -- revelation 22:10
.
"Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy." -- revelation 22:11
.
"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done. -- revelation 22:12
.
"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end." -- revelation 22:13
.
Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city. -- revelation 22:14
.
Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying. -- revelation 22:15
.
"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star." -- revelation 22:16
.
The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost. -- revelation 22:17
.
I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book; -- revelation 22:18
.
and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book. -- revelation 22:19
.
He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. -- revelation 22:20
.
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen. -- revelation 22:21
.
