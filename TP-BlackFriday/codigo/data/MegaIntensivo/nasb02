'Let me, I pray, cross over and see the fair land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.' -- deuteronomy 3:25
.
"But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me; and the LORD said to me, 'Enough! Speak to Me no more of this matter. -- deuteronomy 3:26
.
'Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan. -- deuteronomy 3:27
.
'But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he will give them as an inheritance the land which you will see.' -- deuteronomy 3:28
.
"So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor. -- deuteronomy 3:29
.
"Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. -- deuteronomy 4:1
.
"You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. -- deuteronomy 4:2
.
"Your eyes have seen what the LORD has done in the case of Baal-peor, for all the men who followed Baal-peor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you. -- deuteronomy 4:3
.
"But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you. -- deuteronomy 4:4
.
"See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it. -- deuteronomy 4:5
.
"So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.' -- deuteronomy 4:6
.
"For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him? -- deuteronomy 4:7
.
"Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole law which I am setting before you today? -- deuteronomy 4:8
.
"Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and your grandsons. -- deuteronomy 4:9
.
"Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, 'Assemble the people to Me, that I may let them hear My words so they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.' -- deuteronomy 4:10
.
"You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the very heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud and thick gloom. -- deuteronomy 4:11
.
"Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form--only a voice. -- deuteronomy 4:12
.
"So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. -- deuteronomy 4:13
.
"The LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might perform them in the land where you are going over to possess it. -- deuteronomy 4:14
.
"So watch yourselves carefully, since you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire, -- deuteronomy 4:15
.
so that you do not act corruptly and make a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, -- deuteronomy 4:16
.
the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky, -- deuteronomy 4:17
.
the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water below the earth. -- deuteronomy 4:18
.
"And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. -- deuteronomy 4:19
.
"But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be a people for His own possession, as today. -- deuteronomy 4:20
.
"Now the LORD was angry with me on your account, and swore that I would not cross the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. -- deuteronomy 4:21
.
"For I will die in this land, I shall not cross the Jordan, but you shall cross and take possession of this good land. -- deuteronomy 4:22
.
"So watch yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything against which the LORD your God has commanded you. -- deuteronomy 4:23
.
"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. -- deuteronomy 4:24
.
"When you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land, and act corruptly, and make an idol in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD your God so as to provoke Him to anger, -- deuteronomy 4:25
.
I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it. You shall not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed. -- deuteronomy 4:26
.
"The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD drives you. -- deuteronomy 4:27
.
"There you will serve gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell. -- deuteronomy 4:28
.
"But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul. -- deuteronomy 4:29
.
"When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice. -- deuteronomy 4:30
.
"For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them. -- deuteronomy 4:31
.
"Indeed, ask now concerning the former days which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and inquire from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything been done like this great thing, or has anything been heard like it? -- deuteronomy 4:32
.
"Has any people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard it, and survived? -- deuteronomy 4:33
.
"Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? -- deuteronomy 4:34
.
"To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him. -- deuteronomy 4:35
.
"Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; and on earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire. -- deuteronomy 4:36
.
"Because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them. And He personally brought you from Egypt by His great power, -- deuteronomy 4:37
.
driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in and to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today. -- deuteronomy 4:38
.
"Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other. -- deuteronomy 4:39
.
"So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time." -- deuteronomy 4:40
.
Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east, -- deuteronomy 4:41
.
that a manslayer might flee there, who unintentionally slew his neighbor without having enmity toward him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live: -- deuteronomy 4:42
.
Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites. -- deuteronomy 4:43
.
Now this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel; -- deuteronomy 4:44
.
these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out from Egypt, -- deuteronomy 4:45
.
across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt. -- deuteronomy 4:46
.
They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan to the east, -- deuteronomy 4:47
.
from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon), -- deuteronomy 4:48
.
with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah. -- deuteronomy 4:49
.
Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I am speaking today in your hearing, that you may learn them and observe them carefully. -- deuteronomy 5:1
.
"The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. -- deuteronomy 5:2
.
"The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, with all those of us alive here today. -- deuteronomy 5:3
.
"The LORD spoke to you face to face at the mountain from the midst of the fire, -- deuteronomy 5:4
.
while I was standing between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain. He said, -- deuteronomy 5:5
.
'I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. -- deuteronomy 5:6
.
'You shall have no other gods before Me. -- deuteronomy 5:7
.
'You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. -- deuteronomy 5:8
.
'You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, -- deuteronomy 5:9
.
but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. -- deuteronomy 5:10
.
'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain. -- deuteronomy 5:11
.
'Observe the sabbath day to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you. -- deuteronomy 5:12
.
'Six days you shall labor and do all your work, -- deuteronomy 5:13
.
but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you, so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. -- deuteronomy 5:14
.
'You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day. -- deuteronomy 5:15
.
'Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you on the land which the LORD your God gives you. -- deuteronomy 5:16
.
'You shall not murder. -- deuteronomy 5:17
.
'You shall not commit adultery. -- deuteronomy 5:18
.
'You shall not steal. -- deuteronomy 5:19
.
'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. -- deuteronomy 5:20
.
'You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, and you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field or his male servant or his female servant, his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.' -- deuteronomy 5:21
.
"These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, of the cloud and of the thick gloom, with a great voice, and He added no more. He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me. -- deuteronomy 5:22
.
"And when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders. -- deuteronomy 5:23
.
"You said, 'Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire; we have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he lives. -- deuteronomy 5:24
.
'Now then why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, then we will die. -- deuteronomy 5:25
.
'For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? -- deuteronomy 5:26
.
'Go near and hear all that the LORD our God says; then speak to us all that the LORD our God speaks to you, and we will hear and do it.' -- deuteronomy 5:27
.
"The LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken. -- deuteronomy 5:28
.
'Oh that they had such a heart in them, that they would fear Me and keep all My commandments always, that it may be well with them and with their sons forever! -- deuteronomy 5:29
.
'Go, say to them, "Return to your tents." -- deuteronomy 5:30
.
'But as for you, stand here by Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may observe them in the land which I give them to possess.' -- deuteronomy 5:31
.
"So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left. -- deuteronomy 5:32
.
"You shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you will possess. -- deuteronomy 5:33
.
"Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess it, -- deuteronomy 6:1
.
so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged. -- deuteronomy 6:2
.
"O Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it, that it may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. -- deuteronomy 6:3
.
"Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one! -- deuteronomy 6:4
.
"You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. -- deuteronomy 6:5
.
"These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. -- deuteronomy 6:6
.
"You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. -- deuteronomy 6:7
.
"You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. -- deuteronomy 6:8
.
"You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. -- deuteronomy 6:9
.
"Then it shall come about when the LORD your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you, great and splendid cities which you did not build, -- deuteronomy 6:10
.
and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you eat and are satisfied, -- deuteronomy 6:11
.
then watch yourself, that you do not forget the LORD who brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. -- deuteronomy 6:12
.
"You shall fear only the LORD your God; and you shall worship Him and swear by His name. -- deuteronomy 6:13
.
"You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who surround you, -- deuteronomy 6:14
.
for the LORD your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth. -- deuteronomy 6:15
.
"You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested Him at Massah. -- deuteronomy 6:16
.
"You should diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies and His statutes which He has commanded you. -- deuteronomy 6:17
.
"You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to give your fathers, -- deuteronomy 6:18
.
by driving out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken. -- deuteronomy 6:19
.
"When your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What do the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments mean which the LORD our God commanded you?' -- deuteronomy 6:20
.
then you shall say to your son, 'We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the LORD brought us from Egypt with a mighty hand. -- deuteronomy 6:21
.
'Moreover, the LORD showed great and distressing signs and wonders before our eyes against Egypt, Pharaoh and all his household; -- deuteronomy 6:22
.
He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land which He had sworn to our fathers.' -- deuteronomy 6:23
.
"So the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God for our good always and for our survival, as it is today. -- deuteronomy 6:24
.
"It will be righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all this commandment before the LORD our God, just as He commanded us. -- deuteronomy 6:25
.
"When the LORD your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and stronger than you, -- deuteronomy 7:1
.
and when the LORD your God delivers them before you and you defeat them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them. -- deuteronomy 7:2
.
"Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons. -- deuteronomy 7:3
.
"For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods; then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you and He will quickly destroy you. -- deuteronomy 7:4
.
"But thus you shall do to them: you shall tear down their altars, and smash their sacred pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire. -- deuteronomy 7:5
.
"For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. -- deuteronomy 7:6
.
"The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples, -- deuteronomy 7:7
.
but because the LORD loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers, the LORD brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. -- deuteronomy 7:8
.
"Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments; -- deuteronomy 7:9
.
but repays those who hate Him to their faces, to destroy them; He will not delay with him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face. -- deuteronomy 7:10
.
"Therefore, you shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them. -- deuteronomy 7:11
.
"Then it shall come about, because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them, that the LORD your God will keep with you His covenant and His lovingkindness which He swore to your forefathers. -- deuteronomy 7:12
.
"He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you. -- deuteronomy 7:13
.
"You shall be blessed above all peoples; there will be no male or female barren among you or among your cattle. -- deuteronomy 7:14
.
"The LORD will remove from you all sickness; and He will not put on you any of the harmful diseases of Egypt which you have known, but He will lay them on all who hate you. -- deuteronomy 7:15
.
"You shall consume all the peoples whom the LORD your God will deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you. -- deuteronomy 7:16
.
"If you should say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?' -- deuteronomy 7:17
.
you shall not be afraid of them; you shall well remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: -- deuteronomy 7:18
.
the great trials which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. So shall the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. -- deuteronomy 7:19
.
"Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet against them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you perish. -- deuteronomy 7:20
.
"You shall not dread them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God. -- deuteronomy 7:21
.
"The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little; you will not be able to put an end to them quickly, for the wild beasts would grow too numerous for you. -- deuteronomy 7:22
.
"But the LORD your God will deliver them before you, and will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed. -- deuteronomy 7:23
.
"He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you will make their name perish from under heaven; no man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them. -- deuteronomy 7:24
.
"The graven images of their gods you are to burn with fire; you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, or you will be snared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God. -- deuteronomy 7:25
.
"You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and like it come under the ban; you shall utterly detest it and you shall utterly abhor it, for it is something banned. -- deuteronomy 7:26
.
"All the commandments that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your forefathers. -- deuteronomy 8:1
.
"You shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. -- deuteronomy 8:2
.
"He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD. -- deuteronomy 8:3
.
"Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years. -- deuteronomy 8:4
.
"Thus you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son. -- deuteronomy 8:5
.
"Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him. -- deuteronomy 8:6
.
"For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills; -- deuteronomy 8:7
.
a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey; -- deuteronomy 8:8
.
a land where you will eat food without scarcity, in which you will not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. -- deuteronomy 8:9
.
"When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you. -- deuteronomy 8:10
.
"Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you today; -- deuteronomy 8:11
.
otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and lived in them, -- deuteronomy 8:12
.
and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and gold multiply, and all that you have multiplies, -- deuteronomy 8:13
.
then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. -- deuteronomy 8:14
.
"He led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water; He brought water for you out of the rock of flint. -- deuteronomy 8:15
.
"In the wilderness He fed you manna which your fathers did not know, that He might humble you and that He might test you, to do good for you in the end. -- deuteronomy 8:16
.
"Otherwise, you may say in your heart, 'My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.' -- deuteronomy 8:17
.
"But you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day. -- deuteronomy 8:18
.
"It shall come about if you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish. -- deuteronomy 8:19
.
"Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you would not listen to the voice of the LORD your God. -- deuteronomy 8:20
.
"Hear, O Israel! You are crossing over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, great cities fortified to heaven, -- deuteronomy 9:1
.
a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?' -- deuteronomy 9:2
.
"Know therefore today that it is the LORD your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly, just as the LORD has spoken to you. -- deuteronomy 9:3
.
"Do not say in your heart when the LORD your God has driven them out before you, 'Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,' but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is dispossessing them before you. -- deuteronomy 9:4
.
"It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm the oath which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. -- deuteronomy 9:5
.
"Know, then, it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people. -- deuteronomy 9:6
.
"Remember, do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD. -- deuteronomy 9:7
.
"Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that He would have destroyed you. -- deuteronomy 9:8
.
"When I went up to the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the LORD had made with you, then I remained on the mountain forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water. -- deuteronomy 9:9
.
"The LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God; and on them were all the words which the LORD had spoken with you at the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. -- deuteronomy 9:10
.
"It came about at the end of forty days and nights that the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. -- deuteronomy 9:11
.
"Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made a molten image for themselves.' -- deuteronomy 9:12
.
"The LORD spoke further to me, saying, 'I have seen this people, and indeed, it is a stubborn people. -- deuteronomy 9:13
.
'Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.' -- deuteronomy 9:14
.
"So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. -- deuteronomy 9:15
.
"And I saw that you had indeed sinned against the LORD your God. You had made for yourselves a molten calf; you had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you. -- deuteronomy 9:16
.
"I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands and smashed them before your eyes. -- deuteronomy 9:17
.
"I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger. -- deuteronomy 9:18
.
"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wrathful against you in order to destroy you, but the LORD listened to me that time also. -- deuteronomy 9:19
.
"The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I also prayed for Aaron at the same time. -- deuteronomy 9:20
.
"I took your sinful thing, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that came down from the mountain. -- deuteronomy 9:21
.
"Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath. -- deuteronomy 9:22
.
"When the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and possess the land which I have given you,' then you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice. -- deuteronomy 9:23
.
"You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day I knew you. -- deuteronomy 9:24
.
"So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and nights, which I did because the LORD had said He would destroy you. -- deuteronomy 9:25
.
"I prayed to the LORD and said, 'O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, even Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. -- deuteronomy 9:26
.
'Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin. -- deuteronomy 9:27
.
'Otherwise the land from which You brought us may say, "Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which He had promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness." -- deuteronomy 9:28
.
'Yet they are Your people, even Your inheritance, whom You have brought out by Your great power and Your outstretched arm.' -- deuteronomy 9:29
.
"At that time the LORD said to me, 'Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood for yourself. -- deuteronomy 10:1
.
'I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered, and you shall put them in the ark.' -- deuteronomy 10:2
.
"So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. -- deuteronomy 10:3
.
"He wrote on the tablets, like the former writing, the Ten Commandments which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them to me. -- deuteronomy 10:4
.
"Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me." -- deuteronomy 10:5
.
(Now the sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place. -- deuteronomy 10:6
.
From there they set out to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. -- deuteronomy 10:7
.
At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him and to bless in His name until this day. -- deuteronomy 10:8
.
Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, just as the LORD your God spoke to him.) -- deuteronomy 10:9
.
"I, moreover, stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time, and the LORD listened to me that time also; the LORD was not willing to destroy you. -- deuteronomy 10:10
.
"Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, proceed on your journey ahead of the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.' -- deuteronomy 10:11
.
"Now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, -- deuteronomy 10:12
.
and to keep the LORD'S commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good? -- deuteronomy 10:13
.
"Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it. -- deuteronomy 10:14
.
"Yet on your fathers did the LORD set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants after them, even you above all peoples, as it is this day. -- deuteronomy 10:15
.
"So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer. -- deuteronomy 10:16
.
"For the LORD your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe. -- deuteronomy 10:17
.
"He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing. -- deuteronomy 10:18
.
"So show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt. -- deuteronomy 10:19
.
"You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him, and you shall swear by His name. -- deuteronomy 10:20
.
"He is your praise and He is your God, who has done these great and awesome things for you which your eyes have seen. -- deuteronomy 10:21
.
"Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven. -- deuteronomy 10:22
.
"You shall therefore love the LORD your God, and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments. -- deuteronomy 11:1
.
"Know this day that I am not speaking with your sons who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of the LORD your God--His greatness, His mighty hand and His outstretched arm, -- deuteronomy 11:2
.
and His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land; -- deuteronomy 11:3
.
and what He did to Egypt's army, to its horses and its chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea to engulf them while they were pursuing you, and the LORD completely destroyed them; -- deuteronomy 11:4
.
and what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place; -- deuteronomy 11:5
.
and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, among all Israel-- -- deuteronomy 11:6
.
but your own eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which He did. -- deuteronomy 11:7
.
"You shall therefore keep every commandment which I am commanding you today, so that you may be strong and go in and possess the land into which you are about to cross to possess it; -- deuteronomy 11:8
.
so that you may prolong your days on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. -- deuteronomy 11:9
.
"For the land, into which you are entering to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you used to sow your seed and water it with your foot like a vegetable garden. -- deuteronomy 11:10
.
"But the land into which you are about to cross to possess it, a land of hills and valleys, drinks water from the rain of heaven, -- deuteronomy 11:11
.
a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning even to the end of the year. -- deuteronomy 11:12
.
"It shall come about, if you listen obediently to my commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and all your soul, -- deuteronomy 11:13
.
that He will give the rain for your land in its season, the early and late rain, that you may gather in your grain and your new wine and your oil. -- deuteronomy 11:14
.
"He will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. -- deuteronomy 11:15
.
"Beware that your hearts are not deceived, and that you do not turn away and serve other gods and worship them. -- deuteronomy 11:16
.
"Or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its fruit; and you will perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you. -- deuteronomy 11:17
.
"You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul; and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. -- deuteronomy 11:18
.
"You shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up. -- deuteronomy 11:19
.
"You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, -- deuteronomy 11:20
.
so that your days and the days of your sons may be multiplied on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens remain above the earth. -- deuteronomy 11:21
.
"For if you are careful to keep all this commandment which I am commanding you to do, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and hold fast to Him, -- deuteronomy 11:22
.
then the LORD will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you. -- deuteronomy 11:23
.
"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours; your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea. -- deuteronomy 11:24
.
"No man will be able to stand before you; the LORD your God will lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land on which you set foot, as He has spoken to you. -- deuteronomy 11:25
.
"See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: -- deuteronomy 11:26
.
the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am commanding you today; -- deuteronomy 11:27
.
and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following other gods which you have not known. -- deuteronomy 11:28
.
"It shall come about, when the LORD your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, that you shall place the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. -- deuteronomy 11:29
.
"Are they not across the Jordan, west of the way toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? -- deuteronomy 11:30
.
"For you are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and live in it, -- deuteronomy 11:31
.
and you shall be careful to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you today. -- deuteronomy 11:32
.
"These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall carefully observe in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess as long as you live on the earth. -- deuteronomy 12:1
.
"You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree. -- deuteronomy 12:2
.
"You shall tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and burn their Asherim with fire, and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place. -- deuteronomy 12:3
.
"You shall not act like this toward the LORD your God. -- deuteronomy 12:4
.
"But you shall seek the LORD at the place which the LORD your God will choose from all your tribes, to establish His name there for His dwelling, and there you shall come. -- deuteronomy 12:5
.
"There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution of your hand, your votive offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock. -- deuteronomy 12:6
.
"There also you and your households shall eat before the LORD your God, and rejoice in all your undertakings in which the LORD your God has blessed you. -- deuteronomy 12:7
.
"You shall not do at all what we are doing here today, every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes; -- deuteronomy 12:8
.
for you have not as yet come to the resting place and the inheritance which the LORD your God is giving you. -- deuteronomy 12:9
.
"When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security, -- deuteronomy 12:10
.
then it shall come about that the place in which the LORD your God will choose for His name to dwell, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution of your hand, and all your choice votive offerings which you will vow to the LORD. -- deuteronomy 12:11
.
"And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance with you. -- deuteronomy 12:12
.
"Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every cultic place you see, -- deuteronomy 12:13
.
but in the place which the LORD chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you. -- deuteronomy 12:14
.
"However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, whatever you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the deer. -- deuteronomy 12:15
.
"Only you shall not eat the blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water. -- deuteronomy 12:16
.
"You are not allowed to eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, or the firstborn of your herd or flock, or any of your votive offerings which you vow, or your freewill offerings, or the contribution of your hand. -- deuteronomy 12:17
.
"But you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God will choose, you and your son and daughter, and your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all your undertakings. -- deuteronomy 12:18
.
"Be careful that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land. -- deuteronomy 12:19
.
"When the LORD your God extends your border as He has promised you, and you say, 'I will eat meat,' because you desire to eat meat, then you may eat meat, whatever you desire. -- deuteronomy 12:20
.
"If the place which the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you may slaughter of your herd and flock which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates whatever you desire. -- deuteronomy 12:21
.
"Just as a gazelle or a deer is eaten, so you will eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat of it. -- deuteronomy 12:22
.
"Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh. -- deuteronomy 12:23
.
"You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water. -- deuteronomy 12:24
.
"You shall not eat it, so that it may be well with you and your sons after you, for you will be doing what is right in the sight of the LORD. -- deuteronomy 12:25
.
"Only your holy things which you may have and your votive offerings, you shall take and go to the place which the LORD chooses. -- deuteronomy 12:26
.
"And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh. -- deuteronomy 12:27
.
"Be careful to listen to all these words which I command you, so that it may be well with you and your sons after you forever, for you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God. -- deuteronomy 12:28
.
"When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations which you are going in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land, -- deuteronomy 12:29
.
beware that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, 'How do these nations serve their gods, that I also may do likewise?' -- deuteronomy 12:30
.
"You shall not behave thus toward the LORD your God, for every abominable act which the LORD hates they have done for their gods; for they even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods. -- deuteronomy 12:31
.
"Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to nor take away from it. -- deuteronomy 12:32
.
"If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, -- deuteronomy 13:1
.
and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, 'Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,' -- deuteronomy 13:2
.
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to find out if you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. -- deuteronomy 13:3
.
"You shall follow the LORD your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him. -- deuteronomy 13:4
.
"But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from among you. -- deuteronomy 13:5
.
"If your brother, your mother's son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' (whom neither you nor your fathers have known, -- deuteronomy 13:6
.
of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other end), -- deuteronomy 13:7
.
you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him. -- deuteronomy 13:8
.
"But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. -- deuteronomy 13:9
.
"So you shall stone him to death because he has sought to seduce you from the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. -- deuteronomy 13:10
.
"Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you. -- deuteronomy 13:11
.
"If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to live in, anyone saying that -- deuteronomy 13:12
.
some worthless men have gone out from among you and have seduced the inhabitants of their city, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' (whom you have not known), -- deuteronomy 13:13
.
then you shall investigate and search out and inquire thoroughly. If it is true and the matter established that this abomination has been done among you, -- deuteronomy 13:14
.
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its cattle with the edge of the sword. -- deuteronomy 13:15
.
"Then you shall gather all its booty into the middle of its open square and burn the city and all its booty with fire as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God; and it shall be a ruin forever. It shall never be rebuilt. -- deuteronomy 13:16
.
"Nothing from that which is put under the ban shall cling to your hand, in order that the LORD may turn from His burning anger and show mercy to you, and have compassion on you and make you increase, just as He has sworn to your fathers, -- deuteronomy 13:17
.
if you will listen to the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all His commandments which I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God. -- deuteronomy 13:18
.
"You are the sons of the LORD your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead. -- deuteronomy 14:1
.
"For you are a holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. -- deuteronomy 14:2
.
"You shall not eat any detestable thing. -- deuteronomy 14:3
.
"These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, -- deuteronomy 14:4

the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep. -- deuteronomy 14:5
.
"Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat. -- deuteronomy 14:6
.
"Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these among those which chew the cud, or among those that divide the hoof in two: the camel and the rabbit and the shaphan, for though they chew the cud, they do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you. -- deuteronomy 14:7
.
"The pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, it is unclean for you. You shall not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses. -- deuteronomy 14:8
.
"These you may eat of all that are in water: anything that has fins and scales you may eat, -- deuteronomy 14:9
.
but anything that does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you. -- deuteronomy 14:10
.
"You may eat any clean bird. -- deuteronomy 14:11
.
"But these are the ones which you shall not eat: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard, -- deuteronomy 14:12
.
and the red kite, the falcon, and the kite in their kinds, -- deuteronomy 14:13
.
and every raven in its kind, -- deuteronomy 14:14

the pelican, the carrion vulture, the cormorant, -- deuteronomy 14:17

the stork, and the heron in their kinds, and the hoopoe and the bat. -- deuteronomy 14:18
.
"And all the teeming life with wings are unclean to you; they shall not be eaten. -- deuteronomy 14:19
.
"You may eat any clean bird. -- deuteronomy 14:20
.
"You shall not eat anything which dies of itself. You may give it to the alien who is in your town, so that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk. -- deuteronomy 14:21
.
"You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes out of the field every year. -- deuteronomy 14:22
.
"You shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God, at the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always. -- deuteronomy 14:23
.
"If the distance is so great for you that you are not able to bring the tithe, since the place where the LORD your God chooses to set His name is too far away from you when the LORD your God blesses you, -- deuteronomy 14:24
.
then you shall exchange it for money, and bind the money in your hand and go to the place which the LORD your God chooses. -- deuteronomy 14:25
.
"You may spend the money for whatever your heart desires: for oxen, or sheep, or wine, or strong drink, or whatever your heart desires; and there you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice, you and your household. -- deuteronomy 14:26
.
"Also you shall not neglect the Levite who is in your town, for he has no portion or inheritance among you. -- deuteronomy 14:27
.
"At the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year, and shall deposit it in your town. -- deuteronomy 14:28
.
"The Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance among you, and the alien, the orphan and the widow who are in your town, shall come and eat and be satisfied, in order that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do. -- deuteronomy 14:29
.
"At the end of every seven years you shall grant a remission of debts. -- deuteronomy 15:1
.
"This is the manner of remission: every creditor shall release what he has loaned to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother, because the LORD'S remission has been proclaimed. -- deuteronomy 15:2
.
"From a foreigner you may exact it, but your hand shall release whatever of yours is with your brother. -- deuteronomy 15:3
.
"However, there will be no poor among you, since the LORD will surely bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, -- deuteronomy 15:4
.
if only you listen obediently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all this commandment which I am commanding you today. -- deuteronomy 15:5
.
"For the LORD your God will bless you as He has promised you, and you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you. -- deuteronomy 15:6
.
"If there is a poor man with you, one of your brothers, in any of your towns in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother; -- deuteronomy 15:7
.
but you shall freely open your hand to him, and shall generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks. -- deuteronomy 15:8
.
"Beware that there is no base thought in your heart, saying, 'The seventh year, the year of remission, is near,' and your eye is hostile toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing; then he may cry to the LORD against you, and it will be a sin in you. -- deuteronomy 15:9
.
"You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings. -- deuteronomy 15:10
.
"For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you, saying, 'You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.' -- deuteronomy 15:11
.
"If your kinsman, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, then he shall serve you six years, but in the seventh year you shall set him free. -- deuteronomy 15:12
.
"When you set him free, you shall not send him away empty-handed. -- deuteronomy 15:13
.

.
"It shall come about if he says to you, 'I will not go out from you,' because he loves you and your household, since he fares well with you; -- deuteronomy 15:16
.
then you shall take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also you shall do likewise to your maidservant. -- deuteronomy 15:17
.
"It shall not seem hard to you when you set him free, for he has given you six years with double the service of a hired man; so the LORD your God will bless you in whatever you do. -- deuteronomy 15:18
.
"You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock; you shall not work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. -- deuteronomy 15:19

"Moreover, the LORD will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone, which you or your fathers have not known. -- deuteronomy 28:64
.
"Among those nations you shall find no rest, and there will be no resting place for the sole of your foot; but there the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and despair of soul. -- deuteronomy 28:65
.
"So your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you will be in dread night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life. -- deuteronomy 28:66
.
"In the morning you shall say, 'Would that it were evening!' And at evening you shall say, 'Would that it were morning!' because of the dread of your heart which you dread, and for the sight of your eyes which you will see. -- deuteronomy 28:67
.
"The LORD will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by the way about which I spoke to you, 'You will never see it again!' And there you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer." -- deuteronomy 28:68
.
These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb. -- deuteronomy 29:1
.
And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land; -- deuteronomy 29:2
.
the great trials which your eyes have seen, those great signs and wonders. -- deuteronomy 29:3
.
"Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a heart to know, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear. -- deuteronomy 29:4
.
"I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandal has not worn out on your foot. -- deuteronomy 29:5
.
"You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, in order that you might know that I am the LORD your God. -- deuteronomy 29:6
.
"When you reached this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us for battle, but we defeated them; -- deuteronomy 29:7
.
and we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites. -- deuteronomy 29:8
.
"So keep the words of this covenant to do them, that you may prosper in all that you do. -- deuteronomy 29:9
.
"You stand today, all of you, before the LORD your God: your chiefs, your tribes, your elders and your officers, even all the men of Israel, -- deuteronomy 29:10
.
your little ones, your wives, and the alien who is within your camps, from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water, -- deuteronomy 29:11
.
that you may enter into the covenant with the LORD your God, and into His oath which the LORD your God is making with you today, -- deuteronomy 29:12
.
in order that He may establish you today as His people and that He may be your God, just as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. -- deuteronomy 29:13
.
"Now not with you alone am I making this covenant and this oath, -- deuteronomy 29:14
.
but both with those who stand here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God and with those who are not with us here today -- deuteronomy 29:15
.
(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed; -- deuteronomy 29:16
.
moreover, you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which they had with them); -- deuteronomy 29:17
.
so that there will not be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations; that there will not be among you a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood. -- deuteronomy 29:18
.
"It shall be when he hears the words of this curse, that he will boast, saying, 'I have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart in order to destroy the watered land with the dry.' -- deuteronomy 29:19
.
"The LORD shall never be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of the LORD and His jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse which is written in this book will rest on him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven. -- deuteronomy 29:20
.
"Then the LORD will single him out for adversity from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant which are written in this book of the law. -- deuteronomy 29:21
.
"Now the generation to come, your sons who rise up after you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of the land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it, will say, -- deuteronomy 29:22
.
'All its land is brimstone and salt, a burning waste, unsown and unproductive, and no grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His anger and in His wrath.' -- deuteronomy 29:23
.
"All the nations will say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?' -- deuteronomy 29:24
.
"Then men will say, 'Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. -- deuteronomy 29:25
.
'They went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they have not known and whom He had not allotted to them. -- deuteronomy 29:26
.
'Therefore, the anger of the LORD burned against that land, to bring upon it every curse which is written in this book; -- deuteronomy 29:27
.
and the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger and in fury and in great wrath, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.' -- deuteronomy 29:28
.
"The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law. -- deuteronomy 29:29
.
"So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind in all nations where the LORD your God has banished you, -- deuteronomy 30:1
.
and you return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons, -- deuteronomy 30:2
.
then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you. -- deuteronomy 30:3
.
"If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you back. -- deuteronomy 30:4
.
"The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers. -- deuteronomy 30:5
.
"Moreover the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live. -- deuteronomy 30:6
.
"The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. -- deuteronomy 30:7
.
"And you shall again obey the LORD, and observe all His commandments which I command you today. -- deuteronomy 30:8
.
"Then the LORD your God will prosper you abundantly in all the work of your hand, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your ground, for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, just as He rejoiced over your fathers; -- deuteronomy 30:9
.
if you obey the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law, if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul. -- deuteronomy 30:10
.
"For this commandment which I command you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it out of reach. -- deuteronomy 30:11
.
"It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?' -- deuteronomy 30:12
.
"Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?' -- deuteronomy 30:13
.
"But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may observe it. -- deuteronomy 30:14
.
"See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and adversity; -- deuteronomy 30:15
.
in that I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you in the land where you are entering to possess it. -- deuteronomy 30:16
.
"But if your heart turns away and you will not obey, but are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them, -- deuteronomy 30:17
.
I declare to you today that you shall surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it. -- deuteronomy 30:18
.
"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, -- deuteronomy 30:19
.
by loving the LORD your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding fast to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them." -- deuteronomy 30:20
.
So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. -- deuteronomy 31:1
.
And he said to them, "I am a hundred and twenty years old today; I am no longer able to come and go, and the LORD has said to me, 'You shall not cross this Jordan.' -- deuteronomy 31:2
.
"It is the LORD your God who will cross ahead of you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, just as the LORD has spoken. -- deuteronomy 31:3
.
"The LORD will do to them just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them. -- deuteronomy 31:4
.
"The LORD will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you. -- deuteronomy 31:5
.
"Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you." -- deuteronomy 31:6
.
Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance. -- deuteronomy 31:7
.
"The LORD is the one who goes ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed." -- deuteronomy 31:8
.
So Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel. -- deuteronomy 31:9
.
Then Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, at the time of the year of remission of debts, at the Feast of Booths, -- deuteronomy 31:10
.
when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place which He will choose, you shall read this law in front of all Israel in their hearing. -- deuteronomy 31:11
.
"Assemble the people, the men and the women and children and the alien who is in your town, so that they may hear and learn and fear the LORD your God, and be careful to observe all the words of this law. -- deuteronomy 31:12
.
"Their children, who have not known, will hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live on the land which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess." -- deuteronomy 31:13
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, the time for you to die is near; call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting. -- deuteronomy 31:14
.
The LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the doorway of the tent. -- deuteronomy 31:15
.
The LORD said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers; and this people will arise and play the harlot with the strange gods of the land, into the midst of which they are going, and will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them. -- deuteronomy 31:16
.
"Then My anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed, and many evils and troubles will come upon them; so that they will say in that day, 'Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us?' -- deuteronomy 31:17
.
"But I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they will do, for they will turn to other gods. -- deuteronomy 31:18
.
"Now therefore, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel. -- deuteronomy 31:19
.
"For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn Me and break My covenant. -- deuteronomy 31:20
.
"Then it shall come about, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants); for I know their intent which they are developing today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore." -- deuteronomy 31:21
.
So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel. -- deuteronomy 31:22
.
Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with you." -- deuteronomy 31:23
.
It came about, when Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book until they were complete, -- deuteronomy 31:24
.
that Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, -- deuteronomy 31:25
.
"Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may remain there as a witness against you. -- deuteronomy 31:26
.
"For I know your rebellion and your stubbornness; behold, while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more, then, after my death? -- deuteronomy 31:27
.
"Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them. -- deuteronomy 31:28
.
"For I know that after my death you will act corruptly and turn from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, for you will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands." -- deuteronomy 31:29
.
Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were complete: -- deuteronomy 31:30
.
"Give ear, O heavens, and let me speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth. -- deuteronomy 32:1
.
"Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As the droplets on the fresh grass And as the showers on the herb. -- deuteronomy 32:2
.
"For I proclaim the name of the LORD; Ascribe greatness to our God! -- deuteronomy 32:3
.
"The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He. -- deuteronomy 32:4
.
"They have acted corruptly toward Him, They are not His children, because of their defect; But are a perverse and crooked generation. -- deuteronomy 32:5
.
"Do you thus repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is not He your Father who has bought you? He has made you and established you. -- deuteronomy 32:6
.
"Remember the days of old, Consider the years of all generations. Ask your father, and he will inform you, Your elders, and they will tell you. -- deuteronomy 32:7
.
"When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When He separated the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel. -- deuteronomy 32:8
.
"For the LORD'S portion is His people; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance. -- deuteronomy 32:9
.
"He found him in a desert land, And in the howling waste of a wilderness; He encircled him, He cared for him, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye. -- deuteronomy 32:10
.
"Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, That hovers over its young, He spread His wings and caught them, He carried them on His pinions. -- deuteronomy 32:11
.
"The LORD alone guided him, And there was no foreign god with him. -- deuteronomy 32:12
.
"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he ate the produce of the field; And He made him suck honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock, -- deuteronomy 32:13
.
Curds of cows, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams, the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat-- And of the blood of grapes you drank wine. -- deuteronomy 32:14
.
"But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked-- You are grown fat, thick, and sleek-- Then he forsook God who made him, And scorned the Rock of his salvation. -- deuteronomy 32:15
.
"They made Him jealous with strange gods; With abominations they provoked Him to anger. -- deuteronomy 32:16
.
"They sacrificed to demons who were not God, To gods whom they have not known, New gods who came lately, Whom your fathers did not dread. -- deuteronomy 32:17
.
"You neglected the Rock who begot you, And forgot the God who gave you birth. -- deuteronomy 32:18
.
"The LORD saw this, and spurned them Because of the provocation of His sons and daughters. -- deuteronomy 32:19
.
"Then He said, 'I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end shall be; For they are a perverse generation, Sons in whom is no faithfulness. -- deuteronomy 32:20
.
'They have made Me jealous with what is not God; They have provoked Me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation, -- deuteronomy 32:21
.
For a fire is kindled in My anger, And burns to the lowest part of Sheol, And consumes the earth with its yield, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. -- deuteronomy 32:22
.
'I will heap misfortunes on them; I will use My arrows on them. -- deuteronomy 32:23
.
'They will be wasted by famine, and consumed by plague And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, With the venom of crawling things of the dust. -- deuteronomy 32:24
.
'Outside the sword will bereave, And inside terror-- Both young man and virgin, The nursling with the man of gray hair. -- deuteronomy 32:25
.
'I would have said, "I will cut them to pieces, I will remove the memory of them from men," -- deuteronomy 32:26
.
Had I not feared the provocation by the enemy, That their adversaries would misjudge, That they would say, "Our hand is triumphant, And the LORD has not done all this."' -- deuteronomy 32:27
.
"For they are a nation lacking in counsel, And there is no understanding in them. -- deuteronomy 32:28
.
"Would that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would discern their future! -- deuteronomy 32:29
.
"How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had given them up? -- deuteronomy 32:30
.
"Indeed their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves judge this. -- deuteronomy 32:31
.
"For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of poison, Their clusters, bitter. -- deuteronomy 32:32
.
"Their wine is the venom of serpents, And the deadly poison of cobras. -- deuteronomy 32:33
.
'Is it not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up in My treasuries? -- deuteronomy 32:34
.
'Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.' -- deuteronomy 32:35
.
"For the LORD will vindicate His people, And will have compassion on His servants, When He sees that their strength is gone, And there is none remaining, bond or free. -- deuteronomy 32:36
.
"And He will say, 'Where are their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge? -- deuteronomy 32:37
.
'Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your hiding place! -- deuteronomy 32:38
.
'See now that I, I am He, And there is no god besides Me; It is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded and it is I who heal, And there is no one who can deliver from My hand. -- deuteronomy 32:39
.
'Indeed, I lift up My hand to heaven, And say, as I live forever, -- deuteronomy 32:40
.
If I sharpen My flashing sword, And My hand takes hold on justice, I will render vengeance on My adversaries, And I will repay those who hate Me. -- deuteronomy 32:41
.
'I will make My arrows drunk with blood, And My sword will devour flesh, With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the long-haired leaders of the enemy.' -- deuteronomy 32:42
.
"Rejoice, O nations, with His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And will render vengeance on His adversaries, And will atone for His land and His people." -- deuteronomy 32:43
.
Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he, with Joshua the son of Nun. -- deuteronomy 32:44
.
When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, -- deuteronomy 32:45
.
he said to them, "Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today, which you shall command your sons to observe carefully, even all the words of this law. -- deuteronomy 32:46
.
"For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your life. And by this word you will prolong your days in the land, which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess." -- deuteronomy 32:47
.
The LORD spoke to Moses that very same day, saying, -- deuteronomy 32:48
.
"Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho, and look at the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession. -- deuteronomy 32:49
.
"Then die on the mountain where you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people, -- deuteronomy 32:50
.
because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not treat Me as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel. -- deuteronomy 32:51
.
"For you shall see the land at a distance, but you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving the sons of Israel." -- deuteronomy 32:52
.
Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death. -- deuteronomy 33:1
.
He said, "The LORD came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came from the midst of ten thousand holy ones; At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them. -- deuteronomy 33:2
.
"Indeed, He loves the people; All Your holy ones are in Your hand, And they followed in Your steps; Everyone receives of Your words. -- deuteronomy 33:3
.
"Moses charged us with a law, A possession for the assembly of Jacob. -- deuteronomy 33:4
.
"And He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, The tribes of Israel together. -- deuteronomy 33:5
.
"May Reuben live and not die, Nor his men be few." -- deuteronomy 33:6
.
And this regarding Judah; so he said, "Hear, O LORD, the voice of Judah, And bring him to his people. With his hands he contended for them, And may You be a help against his adversaries." -- deuteronomy 33:7
.
Of Levi he said, "Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to Your godly man, Whom You proved at Massah, With whom You contended at the waters of Meribah; -- deuteronomy 33:8
.
Who said of his father and his mother, 'I did not consider them'; And he did not acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he regard his own sons, For they observed Your word, And kept Your covenant. -- deuteronomy 33:9
.
"They shall teach Your ordinances to Jacob, And Your law to Israel. They shall put incense before You, And whole burnt offerings on Your altar. -- deuteronomy 33:10
.
"O LORD, bless his substance, And accept the work of his hands; Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him, And those who hate him, so that they will not rise again." -- deuteronomy 33:11
.
Of Benjamin he said, "May the beloved of the LORD dwell in security by Him, Who shields him all the day, And he dwells between His shoulders." -- deuteronomy 33:12
.
Of Joseph he said, "Blessed of the LORD be his land, With the choice things of heaven, with the dew, And from the deep lying beneath, -- deuteronomy 33:13
.
And with the choice yield of the sun, And with the choice produce of the months. -- deuteronomy 33:14
.
"And with the best things of the ancient mountains, And with the choice things of the everlasting hills, -- deuteronomy 33:15
.
And with the choice things of the earth and its fullness, And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let it come to the head of Joseph, And to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers. -- deuteronomy 33:16
.
"As the firstborn of his ox, majesty is his, And his horns are the horns of the wild ox; With them he will push the peoples, All at once, to the ends of the earth. And those are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And those are the thousands of Manasseh." -- deuteronomy 33:17
.
Of Zebulun he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going forth, And, Issachar, in your tents. -- deuteronomy 33:18
.
"They will call peoples to the mountain; There they will offer righteous sacrifices; For they will draw out the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand." -- deuteronomy 33:19
.
Of Gad he said, "Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad; He lies down as a lion, And tears the arm, also the crown of the head. -- deuteronomy 33:20
.
"Then he provided the first part for himself, For there the ruler's portion was reserved; And he came with the leaders of the people; He executed the justice of the LORD, And His ordinances with Israel." -- deuteronomy 33:21
.
Of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's whelp, That leaps forth from Bashan." -- deuteronomy 33:22
.
Of Naphtali he said, "O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full of the blessing of the LORD, Take possession of the sea and the south." -- deuteronomy 33:23
.
Of Asher he said, "More blessed than sons is Asher; May he be favored by his brothers, And may he dip his foot in oil. -- deuteronomy 33:24
.
"Your locks will be iron and bronze, And according to your days, so will your leisurely walk be. -- deuteronomy 33:25
.
"There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Who rides the heavens to your help, And through the skies in His majesty. -- deuteronomy 33:26
.
"The eternal God is a dwelling place, And underneath are the everlasting arms; And He drove out the enemy from before you, And said, 'Destroy!' -- deuteronomy 33:27
.
"So Israel dwells in security, The fountain of Jacob secluded, In a land of grain and new wine; His heavens also drop down dew. -- deuteronomy 33:28
.
"Blessed are you, O Israel; Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, Who is the shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you, And you will tread upon their high places." -- deuteronomy 33:29
.
Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan, -- deuteronomy 34:1
.
and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, -- deuteronomy 34:2
.
and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. -- deuteronomy 34:3
.
Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants'; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there." -- deuteronomy 34:4
.
So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. -- deuteronomy 34:5
.
And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this day. -- deuteronomy 34:6
.
Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated. -- deuteronomy 34:7
.
So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end. -- deuteronomy 34:8
.
Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; and the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- deuteronomy 34:9
.
Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, -- deuteronomy 34:10
.
for all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land, -- deuteronomy 34:11
.
and for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel. -- deuteronomy 34:12
.
Now it came about after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying, -- joshua 1:1
.
"Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel. -- joshua 1:2
.
"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses. -- joshua 1:3
.
"From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory. -- joshua 1:4
.
"No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you. -- joshua 1:5
.
"Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. -- joshua 1:6
.
"Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go. -- joshua 1:7
.
"This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success. -- joshua 1:8
.
"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go." -- joshua 1:9
.
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, -- joshua 1:10
.
"Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, 'Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, to possess it.'" -- joshua 1:11
.
To the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, -- joshua 1:12
.
"Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, 'The LORD your God gives you rest and will give you this land.' -- joshua 1:13
.
"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross before your brothers in battle array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help them, -- joshua 1:14
.
until the LORD gives your brothers rest, as He gives you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land, and possess that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise." -- joshua 1:15
.
They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. -- joshua 1:16
.
"Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses. -- joshua 1:17
.
"Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous." -- joshua 1:18
.
Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." So they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there. -- joshua 2:1
.
It was told the king of Jericho, saying, "Behold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land." -- joshua 2:2
.
And the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land." -- joshua 2:3
.
But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. -- joshua 2:4
.
"It came about when it was time to shut the gate at dark, that the men went out; I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them." -- joshua 2:5
.
But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof. -- joshua 2:6
.
So the men pursued them on the road to the Jordan to the fords; and as soon as those who were pursuing them had gone out, they shut the gate. -- joshua 2:7
.
Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, -- joshua 2:8
.
and said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before you. -- joshua 2:9
.
"For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. -- joshua 2:10
.
"When we heard it, our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath. -- joshua 2:11
.
"Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father's household, and give me a pledge of truth, -- joshua 2:12
.
and spare my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, with all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death." -- joshua 2:13
.
So the men said to her, "Our life for yours if you do not tell this business of ours; and it shall come about when the LORD gives us the land that we will deal kindly and faithfully with you." -- joshua 2:14
.
Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall, so that she was living on the wall. -- joshua 2:15
.
She said to them, "Go to the hill country, so that the pursuers will not happen upon you, and hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return. Then afterward you may go on your way." -- joshua 2:16
.
The men said to her, "We shall be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear, -- joshua 2:17
.
unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather to yourself into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father's household. -- joshua 2:18
.
"It shall come about that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be free; but anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him. -- joshua 2:19
.
"But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath which you have made us swear." -- joshua 2:20
.
She said, "According to your words, so be it." So she sent them away, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window. -- joshua 2:21
.
They departed and came to the hill country, and remained there for three days until the pursuers returned. Now the pursuers had sought them all along the road, but had not found them. -- joshua 2:22
.
Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they related to him all that had happened to them. -- joshua 2:23
.
They said to Joshua, "Surely the LORD has given all the land into our hands; moreover, all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before us." -- joshua 2:24
.
Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they lodged there before they crossed. -- joshua 3:1
.
At the end of three days the officers went through the midst of the camp; -- joshua 3:2
.
and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God with the Levitical priests carrying it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it. -- joshua 3:3
.
"However, there shall be between you and it a distance of about 2,cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before." -- joshua 3:4
.
Then Joshua said to the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you." -- joshua 3:5
.
And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people. -- joshua 3:6
.
Now the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you. -- joshua 3:7
.
"You shall, moreover, command the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'" -- joshua 3:8
.
Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, "Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God." -- joshua 3:9
.
Joshua said, "By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will assuredly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite. -- joshua 3:10
.
"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan. -- joshua 3:11
.
"Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe. -- joshua 3:12
.
"It shall come about when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, and the waters which are flowing down from above will stand in one heap." -- joshua 3:13
.
So when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people, -- joshua 3:14
.
and when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest), -- joshua 3:15
.
the waters which were flowing down from above stood and rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those which were flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho. -- joshua 3:16
.
And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan. -- joshua 3:17
.
Now when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, -- joshua 4:1
.
"Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe, -- joshua 4:2
.
and command them, saying, 'Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet are standing firm, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight.'" -- joshua 4:3
.
So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe; -- joshua 4:4
.
and Joshua said to them, "Cross again to the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel. -- joshua 4:5
.
"Let this be a sign among you, so that when your children ask later, saying, 'What do these stones mean to you?' -- joshua 4:6
.
then you shall say to them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.' So these stones shall become a memorial to the sons of Israel forever." -- joshua 4:7
.
Thus the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging place and put them down there. -- joshua 4:8
.
Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day. -- joshua 4:9
.
For the priests who carried the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed; -- joshua 4:10
.
and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed before the people. -- joshua 4:11
.
The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them; -- joshua 4:12
.
about 40,equipped for war, crossed for battle before the LORD to the desert plains of Jericho. -- joshua 4:13
.
On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; so that they revered him, just as they had revered Moses all the days of his life. -- joshua 4:14
.
Now the LORD said to Joshua, -- joshua 4:15
.
"Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony that they come up from the Jordan." -- joshua 4:16
.
So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, "Come up from the Jordan." -- joshua 4:17
.
It came about when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks as before. -- joshua 4:18
.
Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho. -- joshua 4:19
.
Those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal. -- joshua 4:20
.
He said to the sons of Israel, "When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What are these stones?' -- joshua 4:21
.
then you shall inform your children, saying, 'Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.' -- joshua 4:22
.
"For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed, just as the LORD your God had done to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed; -- joshua 4:23
.
that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, so that you may fear the LORD your God forever." -- joshua 4:24
.
Now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until they had crossed, that their hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the sons of Israel. -- joshua 5:1
.
At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time." -- joshua 5:2
.
So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. -- joshua 5:3
.
This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt. -- joshua 5:4
.
For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised. -- joshua 5:5
.
For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, that is, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD, to whom the LORD had sworn that He would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. -- joshua 5:6
.
Their children whom He raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them along the way. -- joshua 5:7
.
Now when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed. -- joshua 5:8
.
Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day. -- joshua 5:9
.
While the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal they observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho. -- joshua 5:10
.
On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. -- joshua 5:11
.
The manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of the land of Canaan during that year. -- joshua 5:12
.
Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us or for our adversaries?" -- joshua 5:13
.
He said, "No; rather I indeed come now as captain of the host of the LORD." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said to him, "What has my lord to say to his servant?" -- joshua 5:14
.
The captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, "Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so. -- joshua 5:15
.
Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out and no one came in. -- joshua 6:1
.
The LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the valiant warriors. -- joshua 6:2
.
"You shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days. -- joshua 6:3
.
"Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. -- joshua 6:4
.
"It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up every man straight ahead." -- joshua 6:5
.
So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD." -- joshua 6:6
.
Then he said to the people, "Go forward, and march around the city, and let the armed men go on before the ark of the LORD." -- joshua 6:7
.
And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. -- joshua 6:8
.
The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets. -- joshua 6:9
.
But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard nor let a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, 'Shout!' Then you shall shout!" -- joshua 6:10
.
So he had the ark of the LORD taken around the city, circling it once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp. -- joshua 6:11
.
Now Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. -- joshua 6:12
.
The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets; and the armed men went before them and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while they continued to blow the trumpets. -- joshua 6:13
.
Thus the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did so for six days. -- joshua 6:14
.
Then on the seventh day they rose early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times. -- joshua 6:15
.
At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city. -- joshua 6:16
.
"The city shall be under the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. -- joshua 6:17
.
"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things under the ban, so that you do not covet them and take some of the things under the ban, and make the camp of Israel accursed and bring trouble on it. -- joshua 6:18
.
"But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD." -- joshua 6:19
.
So the people shouted, and priests blew the trumpets; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight ahead, and they took the city. -- joshua 6:20
.
They utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword. -- joshua 6:21
.
Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the harlot's house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, as you have sworn to her." -- joshua 6:22
.
So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives and placed them outside the camp of Israel. -- joshua 6:23
.
They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. -- joshua 6:24
.
However, Rahab the harlot and her father's household and all she had, Joshua spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. -- joshua 6:25
.
Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho; with the loss of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up its gates." -- joshua 6:26
.
So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land. -- joshua 6:27
.
But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban, for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the things under the ban, therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the sons of Israel. -- joshua 7:1
.
Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." So the men went up and spied out Ai. -- joshua 7:2
.
They returned to Joshua and said to him, "Do not let all the people go up; only about two or three thousand men need go up to Ai; do not make all the people toil up there, for they are few." -- joshua 7:3
.
So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai. -- joshua 7:4
.
The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men, and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the descent, so the hearts of the people melted and became as water. -- joshua 7:5
.
Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, both he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. -- joshua 7:6
.
Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why did You ever bring this people over the Jordan, only to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been willing to dwell beyond the Jordan! -- joshua 7:7
.
"O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies? -- joshua 7:8
.
"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?" -- joshua 7:9
.
So the LORD said to Joshua, "Rise up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face? -- joshua 7:10
.
"Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived. Moreover, they have also put them among their own things. -- joshua 7:11
.
"Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from your midst. -- joshua 7:12
.
"Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus the LORD, the God of Israel, has said, "There are things under the ban in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you have removed the things under the ban from your midst." -- joshua 7:13
.
'In the morning then you shall come near by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes by lot shall come near by families, and the family which the LORD takes shall come near by households, and the household which the LORD takes shall come near man by man. -- joshua 7:14
.
'It shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.'" -- joshua 7:15
.
So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. -- joshua 7:16
.
He brought the family of Judah near, and he took the family of the Zerahites; and he brought the family of the Zerahites near man by man, and Zabdi was taken. -- joshua 7:17
.
He brought his household near man by man; and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was taken. -- joshua 7:18
.
Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, I implore you, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him; and tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me." -- joshua 7:19
.
So Achan answered Joshua and said, "Truly, I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and this is what I did: -- joshua 7:20
.
when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it." -- joshua 7:21
.
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it. -- joshua 7:22
.
They took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and they poured them out before the LORD. -- joshua 7:23
.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the mantle, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor. -- joshua 7:24
.
Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day." And all Israel stoned them with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones. -- joshua 7:25
.
They raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day, and the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of Achor to this day. -- joshua 7:26
.
Now the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. -- joshua 8:1
.
"You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it." -- joshua 8:2
.
So Joshua rose with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose 30,men, valiant warriors, and sent them out at night. -- joshua 8:3
.
He commanded them, saying, "See, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready. -- joshua 8:4
.
"Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out to meet us as at the first, we will flee before them. -- joshua 8:5
.
"They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are fleeing before us as at the first.' So we will flee before them. -- joshua 8:6
.
"And you shall rise from your ambush and take possession of the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. -- joshua 8:7
.
"Then it will be when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do it according to the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you." -- joshua 8:8
.
So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people. -- joshua 8:9
.
Now Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai. -- joshua 8:10
.
Then all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near and arrived in front of the city, and camped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai. -- joshua 8:11
.
And he took about 5,men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. -- joshua 8:12
.
So they stationed the people, all the army that was on the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua spent that night in the midst of the valley. -- joshua 8:13
.
It came about when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and rose up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. -- joshua 8:14
.
Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. -- joshua 8:15
.
And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city. -- joshua 8:16
.
So not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel, and they left the city unguarded and pursued Israel. -- joshua 8:17
.
Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. -- joshua 8:18
.
The men in ambush rose quickly from their place, and when he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it, and they quickly set the city on fire. -- joshua 8:19
.
When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned against the pursuers. -- joshua 8:20
.
When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and slew the men of Ai. -- joshua 8:21
.
The others came out from the city to encounter them, so that they were trapped in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; and they slew them until no one was left of those who survived or escaped. -- joshua 8:22
.
But they took alive the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua. -- joshua 8:23
.
Now when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them were fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. -- joshua 8:24
.
All who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000--all the people of Ai. -- joshua 8:25
.
For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. -- joshua 8:26
.
Israel took only the cattle and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua. -- joshua 8:27
.
So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation until this day. -- joshua 8:28
.
He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua gave command and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the city gate, and raised over it a great heap of stones that stands to this day. -- joshua 8:29
.
Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal, -- joshua 8:30
.
just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones on which no man had wielded an iron tool; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings. -- joshua 8:31
.
He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the sons of Israel. -- joshua 8:32
.
All Israel with their elders and officers and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as the native. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had given command at first to bless the people of Israel. -- joshua 8:33
.
Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. -- joshua 8:34
.
There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers who were living among them. -- joshua 8:35
.
Now it came about when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of it, -- joshua 9:1
.
that they gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel. -- joshua 9:2
.
When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, -- joshua 9:3
.
they also acted craftily and set out as envoys, and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins worn-out and torn and mended, -- joshua 9:4
.
and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and had become crumbled. -- joshua 9:5
.
They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us." -- joshua 9:6
.
The men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you are living within our land; how then shall we make a covenant with you?" -- joshua 9:7
.
But they said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Then Joshua said to them, "Who are you and where do you come from?" -- joshua 9:8
.
They said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far country because of the fame of the LORD your God; for we have heard the report of Him and all that He did in Egypt, -- joshua 9:9
.
and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth. -- joshua 9:10
.
"So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them and say to them, "We are your servants; now then, make a covenant with us."' -- joshua 9:11
.
"This our bread was warm when we took it for our provisions out of our houses on the day that we left to come to you; but now behold, it is dry and has become crumbled. -- joshua 9:12
.
"These wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey." -- joshua 9:13
.
So the men of Israel took some of their provisions, and did not ask for the counsel of the LORD. -- joshua 9:14
.
Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them. -- joshua 9:15
.
It came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were neighbors and that they were living within their land. -- joshua 9:16
.
Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim. -- joshua 9:17
.
The sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders. -- joshua 9:18
.
But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them. -- joshua 9:19
.
"This we will do to them, even let them live, so that wrath will not be upon us for the oath which we swore to them." -- joshua 9:20
.
The leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them. -- joshua 9:21
.
Then Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you are living within our land? -- joshua 9:22
.
"Now therefore, you are cursed, and you shall never cease being slaves, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God." -- joshua 9:23
.
So they answered Joshua and said, "Because it was certainly told your servants that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. -- joshua 9:24
.
"Now behold, we are in your hands; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us." -- joshua 9:25
.
Thus he did to them, and delivered them from the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them. -- joshua 9:26
.
But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place which He would choose. -- joshua 9:27
.
Now it came about when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were within their land, -- joshua 10:1
.
that he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. -- joshua 10:2
.
Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king of Jarmuth and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, -- joshua 10:3
.
"Come up to me and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel." -- joshua 10:4
.
So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they with all their armies, and camped by Gibeon and fought against it. -- joshua 10:5
.
Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, "Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that live in the hill country have assembled against us." -- joshua 10:6
.
So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors. -- joshua 10:7
.
The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands; not one of them shall stand before you." -- joshua 10:8
.
So Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilgal. -- joshua 10:9
.
And the LORD confounded them before Israel, and He slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. -- joshua 10:10
.
As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword. -- joshua 10:11
.
Then Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, "O sun, stand still at Gibeon, And O moon in the valley of Aijalon." -- joshua 10:12
.
So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day. -- joshua 10:13
.
There was no day like that before it or after it, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel. -- joshua 10:14
.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp to Gilgal. -- joshua 10:15
.
Now these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah. -- joshua 10:16
.
It was told Joshua, saying, "The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah." -- joshua 10:17
.
Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and assign men by it to guard them, -- joshua 10:18
.
but do not stay there yourselves; pursue your enemies and attack them in the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand." -- joshua 10:19
.
It came about when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were destroyed, and the survivors who remained of them had entered the fortified cities, -- joshua 10:20
.
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one uttered a word against any of the sons of Israel. -- joshua 10:21
.
Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring these five kings out to me from the cave." -- joshua 10:22
.
They did so, and brought these five kings out to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. -- joshua 10:23
.
When they brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came near and put their feet on their necks. -- joshua 10:24
.
Joshua then said to them, "Do not fear or be dismayed! Be strong and courageous, for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies with whom you fight." -- joshua 10:25
.
So afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees; and they hung on the trees until evening. -- joshua 10:26
.
It came about at sunset that Joshua gave a command, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and put large stones over the mouth of the cave, to this very day. -- joshua 10:27
.
Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Thus he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho. -- joshua 10:28
.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah. -- joshua 10:29
.
The LORD gave it also with its king into the hands of Israel, and he struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor in it. Thus he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho. -- joshua 10:30
.
And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it. -- joshua 10:31
.
The LORD gave Lachish into the hands of Israel; and he captured it on the second day, and struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah. -- joshua 10:32
.
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua defeated him and his people until he had left him no survivor. -- joshua 10:33
.
And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it. -- joshua 10:34
.
They captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and he utterly destroyed that day every person who was in it, according to all that he had done to Lachish. -- joshua 10:35
.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it. -- joshua 10:36
.
They captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who were in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon. And he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it. -- joshua 10:37
.
Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and they fought against it. -- joshua 10:38
.
He captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had also done to Libnah and its king. -- joshua 10:39
.
Thus Joshua struck all the land, the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings. He left no survivor, but he utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. -- joshua 10:40
.
Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon. -- joshua 10:41
.
Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. -- joshua 10:42
.
So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal. -- joshua 10:43
.
Then it came about, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph, -- joshua 11:1
.
and to the kings who were of the north in the hill country, and in the Arabah--south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and on the heights of Dor on the west-- -- joshua 11:2
.
to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. -- joshua 11:3
.
They came out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. -- joshua 11:4
.
So all of these kings having agreed to meet, came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. -- joshua 11:5
.
Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire." -- joshua 11:6
.
So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them. -- joshua 11:7
.
The LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, so that they defeated them, and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they struck them until no survivor was left to them. -- joshua 11:8
.
Joshua did to them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire. -- joshua 11:9
.
Then Joshua turned back at that time, and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms. -- joshua 11:10
.
They struck every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was no one left who breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire. -- joshua 11:11
.
Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded. -- joshua 11:12
.
However, Israel did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned. -- joshua 11:13
.
All the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the sons of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left no one who breathed. -- joshua 11:14
.
Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses. -- joshua 11:15
.
Thus Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negev, all that land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland -- joshua 11:16
.
from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death. -- joshua 11:17
.
Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings. -- joshua 11:18
.
There was not a city which made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took them all in battle. -- joshua 11:19
.
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to meet Israel in battle in order that he might utterly destroy them, that they might receive no mercy, but that he might destroy them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. -- joshua 11:20
.
Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. -- joshua 11:21
.
There were no Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained. -- joshua 11:22
.
So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war. -- joshua 11:23
.
Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east: -- joshua 12:1
.
Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, both the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, even as far as the brook Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon; -- joshua 12:2
.
and the Arabah as far as the Sea of Chinneroth toward the east, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward toward Beth-jeshimoth, and on the south, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah; -- joshua 12:3
.
and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, -- joshua 12:4
.
and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, as far as the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. -- joshua 12:5
.
Moses the servant of the LORD and the sons of Israel defeated them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh as a possession. -- joshua 12:6
.
Now these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated beyond the Jordan toward the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even as far as Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions, -- joshua 12:7
.
in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, on the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the Negev; the Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite: -- joshua 12:8
.
the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; -- joshua 12:9
.
the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; -- joshua 12:10
.
the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; -- joshua 12:11
.
the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; -- joshua 12:12
.
the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; -- joshua 12:13
.
the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; -- joshua 12:14
.
the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; -- joshua 12:15
.
the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; -- joshua 12:16
.
the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; -- joshua 12:17
.
the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; -- joshua 12:18
.
the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; -- joshua 12:19
.
the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; -- joshua 12:20
.
the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; -- joshua 12:21
.
the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; -- joshua 12:22
.
the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; -- joshua 12:23
.
the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings. -- joshua 12:24
.
Now Joshua was old and advanced in years when the LORD said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and very much of the land remains to be possessed. -- joshua 13:1
.
"This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites; -- joshua 13:2
.
from the Shihor which is east of Egypt, even as far as the border of Ekron to the north (it is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite -- joshua 13:3
.
to the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite; -- joshua 13:4
.
and the land of the Gebalite, and all of Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. -- joshua 13:5
.
"All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you. -- joshua 13:6
.
"Now therefore, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh." -- joshua 13:7
.
With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave to them; -- joshua 13:8
.
from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon; -- joshua 13:9
.
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the sons of Ammon; -- joshua 13:10
.
and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah; -- joshua 13:11
.
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses struck them and dispossessed them. -- joshua 13:12
.
But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel until this day. -- joshua 13:13
.
Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He spoke to him. -- joshua 13:14
.
So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families. -- joshua 13:15
.
Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba; -- joshua 13:16
.
Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon, -- joshua 13:17
.
and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath, -- joshua 13:18
.
and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, -- joshua 13:19
.
and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth, -- joshua 13:20
.
even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land. -- joshua 13:21
.
The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword among the rest of their slain. -- joshua 13:22
.
The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages. -- joshua 13:23
.
Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families. -- joshua 13:24
.
Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah; -- joshua 13:25
.
and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir; -- joshua 13:26
.
and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan to the east. -- joshua 13:27
.
This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages. -- joshua 13:28
.
Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families. -- joshua 13:29
.
Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities; -- joshua 13:30
.
also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families. -- joshua 13:31
.
These are the territories which Moses apportioned for an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east. -- joshua 13:32
.
But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He had promised to them. -- joshua 13:33
.
Now these are the territories which the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them for an inheritance, -- joshua 14:1
.
by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. -- joshua 14:2
.
For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them. -- joshua 14:3
.
For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property. -- joshua 14:4
.
Thus the sons of Israel did just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land. -- joshua 14:5
.
Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know the word which the LORD spoke to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea. -- joshua 14:6
.
"I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him as it was in my heart. -- joshua 14:7
.
"Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the LORD my God fully. -- joshua 14:8
.
"So Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God fully.' -- joshua 14:9
.
"Now behold, the LORD has let me live, just as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness; and now behold, I am eighty-five years old today. -- joshua 14:10
.
"I am still as strong today as I was in the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in. -- joshua 14:11
.
"Now then, give me this hill country about which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; perhaps the LORD will be with me, and I will drive them out as the LORD has spoken." -- joshua 14:12
.
So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. -- joshua 14:13
.
Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day, because he followed the LORD God of Israel fully. -- joshua 14:14
.
Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; for Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war. -- joshua 14:15
.
Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south. -- joshua 15:1
.
Their south border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that turns to the south. -- joshua 15:2
.
Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka. -- joshua 15:3
.
It continued to Azmon and proceeded to the brook of Egypt, and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border. -- joshua 15:4
.
The east border was the Salt Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. -- joshua 15:5
.
Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. -- joshua 15:6
.
The border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south of the valley; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and it ended at En-rogel. -- joshua 15:7
.
Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north. -- joshua 15:8
.
From the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). -- joshua 15:9
.
The border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and continued through Timnah. -- joshua 15:10
.
The border proceeded to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel, and the border ended at the sea. -- joshua 15:11
.
The west border was at the Great Sea, even its coastline. This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families. -- joshua 15:12
.
Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the command of the LORD to Joshua, namely, Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron). -- joshua 15:13
.
Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak. -- joshua 15:14
.
Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher. -- joshua 15:15
.
And Caleb said, "The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife." -- joshua 15:16
.
Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife. -- joshua 15:17
.
It came about that when she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. So she alighted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?" -- joshua 15:18
.
Then she said, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water." So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. -- joshua 15:19
.
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families. -- joshua 15:20
.
Now the cities at the extremity of the tribe of the sons of Judah toward the border of Edom in the south were Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur, -- joshua 15:21
.
and Kinah and Dimonah and Adadah, -- joshua 15:22
.
and Kedesh and Hazor and Ithnan, -- joshua 15:23
.
Ziph and Telem and Bealoth, -- joshua 15:24
.
and Hazor-hadattah and Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor), -- joshua 15:25
.
Amam and Shema and Moladah, -- joshua 15:26
.
and Hazar-gaddah and Heshmon and Beth-pelet, -- joshua 15:27
.
and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Biziothiah, -- joshua 15:28
.
Baalah and Iim and Ezem, -- joshua 15:29
.
and Eltolad and Chesil and Hormah, -- joshua 15:30
.
and Ziklag and Madmannah and Sansannah, -- joshua 15:31
.
and Lebaoth and Shilhim and Ain and Rimmon; in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:32
.
In the lowland: Eshtaol and Zorah and Ashnah, -- joshua 15:33
.
and Zanoah and En-gannim, Tappuah and Enam, -- joshua 15:34
.
Jarmuth and Adullam, Socoh and Azekah, -- joshua 15:35
.
and Shaaraim and Adithaim and Gederah and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:36
.
Zenan and Hadashah and Migdal-gad, -- joshua 15:37
.
and Dilean and Mizpeh and Joktheel, -- joshua 15:38
.
Lachish and Bozkath and Eglon, -- joshua 15:39
.
and Cabbon and Lahmas and Chitlish, -- joshua 15:40
.
and Gederoth, Beth-dagon and Naamah and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:41
.
Libnah and Ether and Ashan, -- joshua 15:42
.
and Iphtah and Ashnah and Nezib, -- joshua 15:43
.
and Keilah and Achzib and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:44
.
Ekron, with its towns and its villages; -- joshua 15:45
.
from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages. -- joshua 15:46
.
Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; as far as the brook of Egypt and the Great Sea, even its coastline. -- joshua 15:47
.
In the hill country: Shamir and Jattir and Socoh, -- joshua 15:48
.
and Dannah and Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), -- joshua 15:49
.
and Anab and Eshtemoh and Anim, -- joshua 15:50
.
and Goshen and Holon and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:51
.
Arab and Dumah and Eshan, -- joshua 15:52
.
and Janum and Beth-tappuah and Aphekah, -- joshua 15:53
.
and Humtah and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:54
.
Maon, Carmel and Ziph and Juttah, -- joshua 15:55
.
and Jezreel and Jokdeam and Zanoah, -- joshua 15:56
.
Kain, Gibeah and Timnah; ten cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:57
.
Halhul, Beth-zur and Gedor, -- joshua 15:58
.
and Maarath and Beth-anoth and Eltekon; six cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:59
.
Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:60
.
In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin and Secacah, -- joshua 15:61
.
and Nibshan and the City of Salt and Engedi; six cities with their villages. -- joshua 15:62
.
Now as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah at Jerusalem until this day. -- joshua 15:63
.
Then the lot for the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel. -- joshua 16:1
.
It went from Bethel to Luz, and continued to the border of the Archites at Ataroth. -- joshua 16:2
.
It went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of lower Beth-horon even to Gezer, and it ended at the sea. -- joshua 16:3
.
The sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance. -- joshua 16:4
.
Now this was the territory of the sons of Ephraim according to their families: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon. -- joshua 16:5
.
Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh and continued beyond it to the east of Janoah. -- joshua 16:6
.
It went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan. -- joshua 16:7
.
From Tappuah the border continued westward to the brook of Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families, -- joshua 16:8
.
together with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. -- joshua 16:9
.
But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers. -- joshua 16:10
.
Now this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war. -- joshua 17:1
.
So the lot was made for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida; these were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. -- joshua 17:2
.
However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. -- joshua 17:3
.
They came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders, saying, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers." So according to the command of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among their father's brothers. -- joshua 17:4
.
Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan, -- joshua 17:5
.
because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh. -- joshua 17:6
.
The border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. -- joshua 17:7
.
The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim. -- joshua 17:8
.
The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook (these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh), and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and it ended at the sea. -- joshua 17:9
.
The south side belonged to Ephraim and the north side to Manasseh, and the sea was their border; and they reached to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east. -- joshua 17:10
.
In Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, the third is Napheth. -- joshua 17:11
.
But the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land. -- joshua 17:12
.
It came about when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely. -- joshua 17:13
.
Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me only one lot and one portion for an inheritance, since I am a numerous people whom the LORD has thus far blessed?" -- joshua 17:14
.
Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you." -- joshua 17:15
.
The sons of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley land have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those who are in the valley of Jezreel." -- joshua 17:16
.
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, "You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have one lot only, -- joshua 17:17
.
but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it, and to its farthest borders it shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have chariots of iron and though they are strong." -- joshua 17:18
.
Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them. -- joshua 18:1
.
There remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance. -- joshua 18:2
.
So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, "How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? -- joshua 18:3
.
"Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe that I may send them, and that they may arise and walk through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance; then they shall return to me. -- joshua 18:4
.
"They shall divide it into seven portions; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north. -- joshua 18:5
.
"You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring the description here to me. I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. -- joshua 18:6
.
"For the Levites have no portion among you, because the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them." -- joshua 18:7
.
Then the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, "Go and walk through the land and describe it, and return to me; then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh." -- joshua 18:8
.
So the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. -- joshua 18:9
.
And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions. -- joshua 18:10
.
Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. -- joshua 18:11
.
Their border on the north side was from the Jordan, then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven. -- joshua 18:12
.
From there the border continued to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill which lies on the south of lower Beth-horon. -- joshua 18:13
.
The border extended from there and turned round on the west side southward, from the hill which lies before Beth-horon southward; and it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side. -- joshua 18:14
.
Then the south side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went westward and went to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah. -- joshua 18:15
.
The border went down to the edge of the hill which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel. -- joshua 18:16
.
It extended northward and went to En-shemesh and went to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. -- joshua 18:17
.
It continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward and went down to the Arabah. -- joshua 18:18
.
The border continued to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border. -- joshua 18:19
.
Moreover, the Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families and according to its borders all around. -- joshua 18:20
.
Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz, -- joshua 18:21
.
and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel, -- joshua 18:22
.
and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah, -- joshua 18:23
.
and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni and Geba; twelve cities with their villages. -- joshua 18:24
.
Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth, -- joshua 18:25
.
and Mizpeh and Chephirah and Mozah, -- joshua 18:26
.
and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah, -- joshua 18:27
.
and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families. -- joshua 18:28
.
Then the second lot fell to Simeon, to the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah. -- joshua 19:1
.
So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah, -- joshua 19:2
.
and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem, -- joshua 19:3
.
and Eltolad and Bethul and Hormah, -- joshua 19:4
.
and Ziklag and Beth-marcaboth and Hazar-susah, -- joshua 19:5
.
and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages; -- joshua 19:6
.
Ain, Rimmon and Ether and Ashan; four cities with their villages; -- joshua 19:7
.
and all the villages which were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families. -- joshua 19:8
.
The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was taken from the portion of the sons of Judah, for the share of the sons of Judah was too large for them; so the sons of Simeon received an inheritance in the midst of Judah's inheritance. -- joshua 19:9
.
Now the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families. And the territory of their inheritance was as far as Sarid. -- joshua 19:10
.
Then their border went up to the west and to Maralah, it then touched Dabbesheth and reached to the brook that is before Jokneam. -- joshua 19:11
.
Then it turned from Sarid to the east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it proceeded to Daberath and up to Japhia. -- joshua 19:12
.
From there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and it proceeded to Rimmon which stretches to Neah. -- joshua 19:13
.
The border circled around it on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the valley of Iphtahel. -- joshua 19:14
.
Included also were Kattah and Nahalal and Shimron and Idalah and Bethlehem; twelve cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:15
.
This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:16
.
The fourth lot fell to Issachar, to the sons of Issachar according to their families. -- joshua 19:17
.
Their territory was to Jezreel and included Chesulloth and Shunem, -- joshua 19:18
.
and Hapharaim and Shion and Anaharath, -- joshua 19:19
.
and Rabbith and Kishion and Ebez, -- joshua 19:20
.
and Remeth and En-gannim and En-haddah and Beth-pazzez. -- joshua 19:21
.
The border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:22
.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:23
.
Now the fifth lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families. -- joshua 19:24
.
Their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph, -- joshua 19:25
.
and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel on the west and to Shihor-libnath. -- joshua 19:26
.
It turned toward the east to Beth-dagon and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it proceeded on north to Cabul, -- joshua 19:27
.
and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon. -- joshua 19:28
.
The border turned to Ramah and to the fortified city of Tyre; then the border turned to Hosah, and it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib. -- joshua 19:29
.
Included also were Ummah, and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:30
.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:31
.
The sixth lot fell to the sons of Naphtali; to the sons of Naphtali according to their families. -- joshua 19:32
.
Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan. -- joshua 19:33
.
Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and proceeded from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south and touched Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east. -- joshua 19:34
.
The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer and Hammath, Rakkath and Chinnereth, -- joshua 19:35
.
and Adamah and Ramah and Hazor, -- joshua 19:36
.
and Kedesh and Edrei and En-hazor, -- joshua 19:37
.
and Yiron and Migdal-el, Horem and Beth-anath and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:38
.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:39
.
The seventh lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families. -- joshua 19:40
.
The territory of their inheritance was Zorah and Eshtaol and Ir-shemesh, -- joshua 19:41
.
and Shaalabbin and Aijalon and Ithlah, -- joshua 19:42
.
and Elon and Timnah and Ekron, -- joshua 19:43
.
and Eltekeh and Gibbethon and Baalath, -- joshua 19:44
.
and Jehud and Bene-berak and Gath-rimmon, -- joshua 19:45
.
and Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the territory over against Joppa. -- joshua 19:46
.
The territory of the sons of Dan proceeded beyond them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan after the name of Dan their father. -- joshua 19:47
.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages. -- joshua 19:48
.
When they finished apportioning the land for inheritance by its borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance in their midst to Joshua the son of Nun. -- joshua 19:49
.
In accordance with the command of the LORD they gave him the city for which he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. So he built the city and settled in it. -- joshua 19:50
.
These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land. -- joshua 19:51
.
Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, -- joshua 20:1
.
"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'Designate the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses, -- joshua 20:2
.
that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become your refuge from the avenger of blood. -- joshua 20:3
.
'He shall flee to one of these cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city to them and give him a place, so that he may dwell among them. -- joshua 20:4
.
'Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand. -- joshua 20:5
.
'He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the manslayer shall return to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled.'" -- joshua 20:6
.
So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. -- joshua 20:7
.
Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. -- joshua 20:8
.
These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally may flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation. -- joshua 20:9
.
Then the heads of households of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of households of the tribes of the sons of Israel. -- joshua 21:1
.
They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, "The LORD commanded through Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasture lands for our cattle." -- joshua 21:2
.
So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these cities with their pasture lands, according to the command of the LORD. -- joshua 21:3
.
Then the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonites and from the tribe of Benjamin. -- joshua 21:4
.
The rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh. -- joshua 21:5
.
The sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. -- joshua 21:6
.
The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun. -- joshua 21:7
.
Now the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. -- joshua 21:8
.
They gave these cities which are here mentioned by name from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon; -- joshua 21:9
.
and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, for the lot was theirs first. -- joshua 21:10
.
Thus they gave them Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, with its surrounding pasture lands. -- joshua 21:11
.
But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession. -- joshua 21:12
.
So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Libnah with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:13
.
and Jattir with its pasture lands and Eshtemoa with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:14
.
and Holon with its pasture lands and Debir with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:15
.
and Ain with its pasture lands and Juttah with its pasture lands and Beth-shemesh with its pasture lands; nine cities from these two tribes. -- joshua 21:16
.
From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:17
.
Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands; four cities. -- joshua 21:18
.
All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands. -- joshua 21:19
.
Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, even to the rest of the sons of Kohath. -- joshua 21:20
.
They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Gezer with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:21
.
and Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands; four cities. -- joshua 21:22
.
From the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:23
.
Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; four cities. -- joshua 21:24
.
From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they allotted Taanach with its pasture lands and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; two cities. -- joshua 21:25
.
All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath were ten. -- joshua 21:26
.
To the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands; two cities. -- joshua 21:27
.
From the tribe of Issachar, they gave Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:28
.
Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-gannim with its pasture lands; four cities. -- joshua 21:29
.
From the tribe of Asher, they gave Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:30
.
Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands; four cities. -- joshua 21:31
.
From the tribe of Naphtali, they gave Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands and Kartan with its pasture lands; three cities. -- joshua 21:32
.
All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands. -- joshua 21:33
.
To the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, they gave from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasture lands and Kartah with its pasture lands. -- joshua 21:34
.
Dimnah with its pasture lands, Nahalal with its pasture lands; four cities. -- joshua 21:35
.
From the tribe of Reuben, they gave Bezer with its pasture lands and Jahaz with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:36
.
Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands; four cities. -- joshua 21:37
.
From the tribe of Gad, they gave Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Mahanaim with its pasture lands, -- joshua 21:38
.
Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands; four cities in all. -- joshua 21:39
.
All these were the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities. -- joshua 21:40
.
All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands. -- joshua 21:41
.
These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; thus it was with all these cities. -- joshua 21:42
.
So the LORD gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and lived in it. -- joshua 21:43
.
And the LORD gave them rest on every side, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers, and no one of all their enemies stood before them; the LORD gave all their enemies into their hand. -- joshua 21:44
.
Not one of the good promises which the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass. -- joshua 21:45
.
Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, -- joshua 22:1
.
and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you. -- joshua 22:2
.
"You have not forsaken your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God. -- joshua 22:3
.
"And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them; therefore turn now and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan. -- joshua 22:4
.
"Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God and walk in all His ways and keep His commandments and hold fast to Him and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul." -- joshua 22:5
.
So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents. -- joshua 22:6
.
Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave a possession among their brothers westward beyond the Jordan. So when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them, -- joshua 22:7
.
and said to them, "Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers." -- joshua 22:8
.
The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed from the sons of Israel at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession which they had possessed, according to the command of the LORD through Moses. -- joshua 22:9
.
When they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance. -- joshua 22:10
.
And the sons of Israel heard it said, "Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the sons of Israel." -- joshua 22:11
.
When the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves at Shiloh to go up against them in war. -- joshua 22:12
.
Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, -- joshua 22:13
.
and with him ten chiefs, one chief for each father's household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one of them was the head of his father's household among the thousands of Israel. -- joshua 22:14
.
They came to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them saying, -- joshua 22:15
.
"Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, 'What is this unfaithful act which you have committed against the God of Israel, turning away from following the LORD this day, by building yourselves an altar, to rebel against the LORD this day? -- joshua 22:16
.
'Is not the iniquity of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although a plague came on the congregation of the LORD, -- joshua 22:17
.
that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? If you rebel against the LORD today, He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow. -- joshua 22:18
.
'If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of the LORD, where the LORD'S tabernacle stands, and take possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD, or rebel against us by building an altar for yourselves, besides the altar of the LORD our God. -- joshua 22:19
.
'Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.'" -- joshua 22:20
.
Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke to the heads of the families of Israel. -- joshua 22:21
.
"The Mighty One, God, the LORD, the Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If it was in rebellion, or if in an unfaithful act against the LORD do not save us this day! -- joshua 22:22
.
"If we have built us an altar to turn away from following the LORD, or if to offer a burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may the LORD Himself require it. -- joshua 22:23
.
"But truly we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, 'In time to come your sons may say to our sons, "What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? -- joshua 22:24
.
"For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no portion in the LORD." So your sons may make our sons stop fearing the LORD.' -- joshua 22:25
.
"Therefore we said, 'Let us build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; -- joshua 22:26
.
rather it shall be a witness between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your sons will not say to our sons in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD."' -- joshua 22:27
.
"Therefore we said, 'It shall also come about if they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, then we shall say, "See the copy of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; rather it is a witness between us and you."' -- joshua 22:28
.
"Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away from following the LORD this day, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle." -- joshua 22:29
.
So when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, even the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them. -- joshua 22:30
.
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this unfaithful act against the LORD; now you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the LORD." -- joshua 22:31
.
Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them. -- joshua 22:32
.
The word pleased the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak of going up against them in war to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living. -- joshua 22:33
.
The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Witness; "For," they said, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God." -- joshua 22:34
.
Now it came about after many days, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on every side, and Joshua was old, advanced in years, -- joshua 23:1
.
that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, "I am old, advanced in years. -- joshua 23:2
.
"And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you, for the LORD your God is He who has been fighting for you. -- joshua 23:3
.
"See, I have apportioned to you these nations which remain as an inheritance for your tribes, with all the nations which I have cut off, from the Jordan even to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun. -- joshua 23:4
.
"The LORD your God, He will thrust them out from before you and drive them from before you; and you will possess their land, just as the LORD your God promised you. -- joshua 23:5
.
"Be very firm, then, to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you may not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left, -- joshua 23:6
.
so that you will not associate with these nations, these which remain among you, or mention the name of their gods, or make anyone swear by them, or serve them, or bow down to them. -- joshua 23:7
.
"But you are to cling to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day. -- joshua 23:8
.
"For the LORD has driven out great and strong nations from before you; and as for you, no man has stood before you to this day. -- joshua 23:9
.
"One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you. -- joshua 23:10
.
"So take diligent heed to yourselves to love the LORD your God. -- joshua 23:11
.
"For if you ever go back and cling to the rest of these nations, these which remain among you, and intermarry with them, so that you associate with them and they with you, -- joshua 23:12
.
know with certainty that the LORD your God will not continue to drive these nations out from before you; but they will be a snare and a trap to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you. -- joshua 23:13
.
"Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the LORD your God spoke concerning you has failed; all have been fulfilled for you, not one of them has failed. -- joshua 23:14
.
"It shall come about that just as all the good words which the LORD your God spoke to you have come upon you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the threats, until He has destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you. -- joshua 23:15
.
"When you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which He has given you." -- joshua 23:16
.
Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and their judges and their officers; and they presented themselves before God. -- joshua 24:1
.
Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'From ancient times your fathers lived beyond the River, namely, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods. -- joshua 24:2
.
'Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac. -- joshua 24:3
.
'To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. -- joshua 24:4
.
'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. -- joshua 24:5
.
'I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. -- joshua 24:6
.
'But when they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness for a long time. -- joshua 24:7
.
'Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you. -- joshua 24:8
.
'Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. -- joshua 24:9
.
'But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you, and I delivered you from his hand. -- joshua 24:10
.
'You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. Thus I gave them into your hand. -- joshua 24:11
.
'Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, but not by your sword or your bow. -- joshua 24:12
.
'I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them; you are eating of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.' -- joshua 24:13
.
"Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. -- joshua 24:14
.
"If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD." -- joshua 24:15
.
The people answered and said, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods; -- joshua 24:16
.
for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did these great signs in our sight and preserved us through all the way in which we went and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed. -- joshua 24:17
.
"The LORD drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. We also will serve the LORD, for He is our God." -- joshua 24:18
.
Then Joshua said to the people, "You will not be able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgression or your sins. -- joshua 24:19
.
"If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you after He has done good to you." -- joshua 24:20
.
The people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the LORD." -- joshua 24:21
.
Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the LORD, to serve Him." And they said, "We are witnesses." -- joshua 24:22
.
"Now therefore, put away the foreign gods which are in your midst, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel." -- joshua 24:23
.
The people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God and we will obey His voice." -- joshua 24:24
.
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. -- joshua 24:25
.
And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. -- joshua 24:26
.
Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be for a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us; thus it shall be for a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God." -- joshua 24:27
.
Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his inheritance. -- joshua 24:28
.
It came about after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old. -- joshua 24:29
.
And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash. -- joshua 24:30
.
Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, and had known all the deeds of the LORD which He had done for Israel. -- joshua 24:31
.
Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph's sons. -- joshua 24:32
.
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim. -- joshua 24:33
.
Now it came about after the death of Joshua that the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD, saying, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?" -- judges 1:1
.
The LORD said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand." -- judges 1:2
.
Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I in turn will go with you into the territory allotted you." So Simeon went with him. -- judges 1:3
.
Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek. -- judges 1:4
.
They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. -- judges 1:5
.
But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. -- judges 1:6
.
Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to gather up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me." So they brought him to Jerusalem and he died there. -- judges 1:7
.
Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. -- judges 1:8
.
Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country and in the Negev and in the lowland. -- judges 1:9
.
So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba); and they struck Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai. -- judges 1:10
.
Then from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir (now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher). -- judges 1:11
.
And Caleb said, "The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will even give him my daughter Achsah for a wife." -- judges 1:12
.
Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for a wife. -- judges 1:13
.
Then it came about when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. Then she alighted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?" -- judges 1:14
.
She said to him, "Give me a blessing, since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. -- judges 1:15
.
The descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah, to the wilderness of Judah which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people. -- judges 1:16
.
Then Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah. -- judges 1:17
.
And Judah took Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory. -- judges 1:18
.
Now the LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots. -- judges 1:19
.
Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised; and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak. -- judges 1:20
.
But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. -- judges 1:21
.
Likewise the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them. -- judges 1:22
.
The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz). -- judges 1:23
.
The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly." -- judges 1:24
.
So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free. -- judges 1:25
.
The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz which is its name to this day. -- judges 1:26
.
But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites persisted in living in that land. -- judges 1:27
.
It came about when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely. -- judges 1:28
.
Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them. -- judges 1:29
.
Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor. -- judges 1:30
.
Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob. -- judges 1:31
.
So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out. -- judges 1:32
.
Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them. -- judges 1:33
.
Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the valley; -- judges 1:34
.
yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house of Joseph grew strong, they became forced labor. -- judges 1:35
.
The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward. -- judges 1:36
.
Now the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I have sworn to your fathers; and I said, 'I will never break My covenant with you, -- judges 2:1
.
and as for you, you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.' But you have not obeyed Me; what is this you have done? -- judges 2:2
.
"Therefore I also said, 'I will not drive them out before you; but they will become as thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.'" -- judges 2:3
.
When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept. -- judges 2:4
.
So they named that place Bochim; and there they sacrificed to the LORD. -- judges 2:5
.
When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel went each to his inheritance to possess the land. -- judges 2:6
.
The people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD which He had done for Israel. -- judges 2:7
.
Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten. -- judges 2:8
.
And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. -- judges 2:9
.
All that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD, nor yet the work which He had done for Israel. -- judges 2:10
.
Then the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals, -- judges 2:11
.
and they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; thus they provoked the LORD to anger. -- judges 2:12
.
So they forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. -- judges 2:13
.
The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies. -- judges 2:14
.
Wherever they went, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had spoken and as the LORD had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed. -- judges 2:15
.
Then the LORD raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them. -- judges 2:16
.
Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do as their fathers. -- judges 2:17
.
When the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them. -- judges 2:18
.
But it came about when the judge died, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them; they did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways. -- judges 2:19
.
So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, "Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice, -- judges 2:20
.
I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died, -- judges 2:21
.
in order to test Israel by them, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it as their fathers did, or not." -- judges 2:22
.
So the LORD allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out quickly; and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua. -- judges 2:23
.
Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them (that is, all who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan; -- judges 3:1
.
only in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war, those who had not experienced it formerly). -- judges 3:2
.
These nations are: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. -- judges 3:3
.
They were for testing Israel, to find out if they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He had commanded their fathers through Moses. -- judges 3:4
.
The sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; -- judges 3:5
.
and they took their daughters for themselves as wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. -- judges 3:6
.
The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. -- judges 3:7
.
Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, so that He sold them into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. -- judges 3:8
.
When the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. -- judges 3:9
.
The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. When he went out to war, the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, so that he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. -- judges 3:10
.
Then the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. -- judges 3:11
.
Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. -- judges 3:12
.
And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and defeated Israel, and they possessed the city of the palm trees. -- judges 3:13
.
The sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. -- judges 3:14
.
But when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. -- judges 3:15
.
Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his cloak. -- judges 3:16
.
He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. -- judges 3:17
.
It came about when he had finished presenting the tribute, that he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. -- judges 3:18
.
But he himself turned back from the idols which were at Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he said, "Keep silence." And all who attended him left him. -- judges 3:19
.
Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat. -- judges 3:20
.
Ehud stretched out his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly. -- judges 3:21
.
The handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out. -- judges 3:22
.
Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the roof chamber behind him, and locked them. -- judges 3:23
.
When he had gone out, his servants came and looked, and behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked; and they said, "He is only relieving himself in the cool room." -- judges 3:24
.
They waited until they became anxious; but behold, he did not open the doors of the roof chamber. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their master had fallen to the floor dead. -- judges 3:25
.
Now Ehud escaped while they were delaying, and he passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah. -- judges 3:26
.
It came about when he had arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was in front of them. -- judges 3:27
.
He said to them, "Pursue them, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hands." So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross. -- judges 3:28
.
They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men; and no one escaped. -- judges 3:29
.
So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land was undisturbed for eighty years. -- judges 3:30
.
After him came Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad; and he also saved Israel. -- judges 3:31
.
Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died. -- judges 4:1
.
And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. -- judges 4:2
.
The sons of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the sons of Israel severely for twenty years. -- judges 4:3
.
Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. -- judges 4:4
.
She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment. -- judges 4:5
.
Now she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, "Behold, the LORD, the God of Israel, has commanded, 'Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun. -- judges 4:6
.
'I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his many troops to the river Kishon, and I will give him into your hand.'" -- judges 4:7
.
Then Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go." -- judges 4:8
.
She said, "I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours on the journey that you are about to take, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hands of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. -- judges 4:9
.
Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up with him; Deborah also went up with him. -- judges 4:10
.
Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh. -- judges 4:11
.
Then they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. -- judges 4:12
.
Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. -- judges 4:13
.
Deborah said to Barak, "Arise! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hands; behold, the LORD has gone out before you." So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. -- judges 4:14
.
The LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot. -- judges 4:15
.
But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not even one was left. -- judges 4:16
.
Now Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. -- judges 4:17
.
Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, "Turn aside, my master, turn aside to me! Do not be afraid." And he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. -- judges 4:18
.
He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a bottle of milk and gave him a drink; then she covered him. -- judges 4:19
.
He said to her, "Stand in the doorway of the tent, and it shall be if anyone comes and inquires of you, and says, 'Is there anyone here?' that you shall say, 'No.'" -- judges 4:20
.
But Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and seized a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died. -- judges 4:21
.
And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." And he entered with her, and behold Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple. -- judges 4:22
.
So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel. -- judges 4:23
.
The hand of the sons of Israel pressed heavier and heavier upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan. -- judges 4:24
.
Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying, -- judges 5:1
.
"That the leaders led in Israel, That the people volunteered, Bless the LORD! -- judges 5:2
.
"Hear, O kings; give ear, O rulers! I--to the LORD, I will sing, I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel. -- judges 5:3
.
"LORD, when You went out from Seir, When You marched from the field of Edom, The earth quaked, the heavens also dripped, Even the clouds dripped water. -- judges 5:4
.
"The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD, This Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel. -- judges 5:5
.
"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, the highways were deserted, And travelers went by roundabout ways. -- judges 5:6
.
"The peasantry ceased, they ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Until I arose, a mother in Israel. -- judges 5:7
.
"New gods were chosen; Then war was in the gates. Not a shield or a spear was seen Among forty thousand in Israel. -- judges 5:8
.
"My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel, The volunteers among the people; Bless the LORD! -- judges 5:9
.
"You who ride on white donkeys, You who sit on rich carpets, And you who travel on the road--sing! -- judges 5:10
.
"At the sound of those who divide flocks among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous deeds of the LORD, The righteous deeds for His peasantry in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates. -- judges 5:11
.
"Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and take away your captives, O son of Abinoam. -- judges 5:12
.
"Then survivors came down to the nobles; The people of the LORD came down to me as warriors. -- judges 5:13
.
"From Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek came down, Following you, Benjamin, with your peoples; From Machir commanders came down, And from Zebulun those who wield the staff of office. -- judges 5:14
.
"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed at his heels; Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart. -- judges 5:15
.
"Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the piping for the flocks? Among the divisions of Reuben There were great searchings of heart. -- judges 5:16
.
"Gilead remained across the Jordan; And why did Dan stay in ships? Asher sat at the seashore, And remained by its landings. -- judges 5:17
.
"Zebulun was a people who despised their lives even to death, And Naphtali also, on the high places of the field. -- judges 5:18
.
"The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan At Taanach near the waters of Megiddo; They took no plunder in silver. -- judges 5:19
.
"The stars fought from heaven, From their courses they fought against Sisera. -- judges 5:20
.
"The torrent of Kishon swept them away, The ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength. -- judges 5:21
.
"Then the horses' hoofs beat From the dashing, the dashing of his valiant steeds. -- judges 5:22
.
'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD, 'Utterly curse its inhabitants; Because they did not come to the help of the LORD, To the help of the LORD against the warriors.' -- judges 5:23
.
"Most blessed of women is Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Most blessed is she of women in the tent. -- judges 5:24
.
"He asked for water and she gave him milk; In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds. -- judges 5:25
.
"She reached out her hand for the tent peg, And her right hand for the workmen's hammer. Then she struck Sisera, she smashed his head; And she shattered and pierced his temple. -- judges 5:26
.
"Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell dead. -- judges 5:27
.
"Out of the window she looked and lamented, The mother of Sisera through the lattice, 'Why does his chariot delay in coming? Why do the hoofbeats of his chariots tarry?' -- judges 5:28
.
"Her wise princesses would answer her, Indeed she repeats her words to herself, -- judges 5:29
.
'Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil? A maiden, two maidens for every warrior; To Sisera a spoil of dyed work, A spoil of dyed work embroidered, Dyed work of double embroidery on the neck of the spoiler?' -- judges 5:30
.
"Thus let all Your enemies perish, O LORD; But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might." And the land was undisturbed for forty years. -- judges 5:31
.
Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD gave them into the hands of Midian seven years. -- judges 6:1
.
The power of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which were in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. -- judges 6:2
.
For it was when Israel had sown, that the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the sons of the east and go against them. -- judges 6:3
.
So they would camp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey. -- judges 6:4
.
For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, they would come in like locusts for number, both they and their camels were innumerable; and they came into the land to devastate it. -- judges 6:5
.
So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried to the LORD. -- judges 6:6
.
Now it came about when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD on account of Midian, -- judges 6:7
.
that the LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel, and he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'It was I who brought you up from Egypt and brought you out from the house of slavery. -- judges 6:8
.
'I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians and from the hands of all your oppressors, and dispossessed them before you and gave you their land, -- judges 6:9
.
and I said to you, "I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live. But you have not obeyed Me."'" -- judges 6:10
.
Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press in order to save it from the Midianites. -- judges 6:11
.
The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, O valiant warrior." -- judges 6:12
.
Then Gideon said to him, "O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian." -- judges 6:13
.
The LORD looked at him and said, "Go in this your strength and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?" -- judges 6:14
.
He said to Him, "O Lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the least in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father's house." -- judges 6:15
.
But the LORD said to him, "Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat Midian as one man." -- judges 6:16
.
So Gideon said to Him, "If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who speak with me. -- judges 6:17
.
"Please do not depart from here, until I come back to You, and bring out my offering and lay it before You." And He said, "I will remain until you return." -- judges 6:18
.
Then Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour; he put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them out to him under the oak and presented them. -- judges 6:19
.
The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so. -- judges 6:20
.
Then the angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. -- judges 6:21
.
When Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD, he said, "Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face." -- judges 6:22
.
The LORD said to him, "Peace to you, do not fear; you shall not die." -- judges 6:23
.
Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and named it The LORD is Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. -- judges 6:24
.
Now on the same night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull and a second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal which belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it; -- judges 6:25
.
and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold in an orderly manner, and take a second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down." -- judges 6:26
.
Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had spoken to him; and because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it by night. -- judges 6:27
.
When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah which was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built. -- judges 6:28
.
They said to one another, "Who did this thing?" And when they searched about and inquired, they said, "Gideon the son of Joash did this thing." -- judges 6:29
.
Then the men of the city said to Joash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal, and indeed, he has cut down the Asherah which was beside it." -- judges 6:30
.
But Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal, or will you deliver him? Whoever will plead for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has torn down his altar." -- judges 6:31
.
Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, that is to say, "Let Baal contend against him," because he had torn down his altar. -- judges 6:32
.
Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves; and they crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel. -- judges 6:33
.
So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together to follow him. -- judges 6:34
.
He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them. -- judges 6:35
.
Then Gideon said to God, "If You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken, -- judges 6:36
.
behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I will know that You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken." -- judges 6:37
.
And it was so. When he arose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he drained the dew from the fleece, a bowl full of water. -- judges 6:38
.
Then Gideon said to God, "Do not let Your anger burn against me that I may speak once more; please let me make a test once more with the fleece, let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground." -- judges 6:39
.
God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and dew was on all the ground. -- judges 6:40
.
Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley. -- judges 7:1
.
The LORD said to Gideon, "The people who are with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hands, for Israel would become boastful, saying, 'My own power has delivered me.' -- judges 7:2
.
"Now therefore come, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, 'Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.'" So 22,people returned, but 10,000 remained. -- judges 7:3
.
Then the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go." -- judges 7:4
.
So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, "You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink." -- judges 7:5
.
Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water. -- judges 7:6
.
The LORD said to Gideon, "I will deliver you with the men who lapped and will give the Midianites into your hands; so let all the other people go, each man to his home." -- judges 7:7
.
So the men took the people's provisions and their trumpets into their hands. And Gideon sent all the other men of Israel, each to his tent, but retained the 300 men; and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley. -- judges 7:8
.
Now the same night it came about that the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hands. -- judges 7:9
.
"But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp, -- judges 7:10
.
and you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened that you may go down against the camp." So he went with Purah his servant down to the outposts of the army that was in the camp. -- judges 7:11
.
Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. -- judges 7:12
.
When Gideon came, behold, a man was relating a dream to his friend. And he said, "Behold, I had a dream; a loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat." -- judges 7:13
.
His friend replied, "This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand." -- judges 7:14
.
When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise, for the LORD has given the camp of Midian into your hands." -- judges 7:15
.
He divided the men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers. -- judges 7:16
.
He said to them, "Look at me and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. -- judges 7:17
.
"When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, then you also blow the trumpets all around the camp and say, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'" -- judges 7:18
.
So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands. -- judges 7:19
.
When the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing, and cried, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!" -- judges 7:20
.
Each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran, crying out as they fled. -- judges 7:21
.
When they blew trumpets, the LORD set the sword of one against another even throughout the whole army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. -- judges 7:22
.
The men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian. -- judges 7:23
.
Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against Midian and take the waters before them, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and they took the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. -- judges 7:24
.
They captured the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan. -- judges 7:25
.
Then the men of Ephraim said to him, "What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?" And they contended with him vigorously. -- judges 8:1
.
But he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? -- judges 8:2
.
"God has given the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb into your hands; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that. -- judges 8:3
.
Then Gideon and the men who were with him came to the Jordan and crossed over, weary yet pursuing. -- judges 8:4
.
He said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are weary, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian." -- judges 8:5
.
The leaders of Succoth said, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?" -- judges 8:6
.
Gideon said, "All right, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will thrash your bodies with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers." -- judges 8:7
.
He went up from there to Penuel and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered. -- judges 8:8
.
So he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, "When I return safely, I will tear down this tower." -- judges 8:9
.
Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about 15,men, all who were left of the entire army of the sons of the east; for the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen. -- judges 8:10
.
Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the camp when the camp was unsuspecting. -- judges 8:11
.
When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army. -- judges 8:12
.
Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. -- judges 8:13
.
And he captured a youth from Succoth and questioned him. Then the youth wrote down for him the princes of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men. -- judges 8:14
.
He came to the men of Succoth and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?'" -- judges 8:15
.
He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them. -- judges 8:16
.
He tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city. -- judges 8:17
.
Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?" And they said, "They were like you, each one resembling the son of a king." -- judges 8:18
.
He said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if only you had let them live, I would not kill you." -- judges 8:19
.
So he said to Jether his firstborn, "Rise, kill them." But the youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a youth. -- judges 8:20
.
Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise up yourself, and fall on us; for as the man, so is his strength." So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments which were on their camels' necks. -- judges 8:21
.
Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you and your son, also your son's son, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian." -- judges 8:22
.
But Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you." -- judges 8:23
.
Yet Gideon said to them, "I would request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his spoil." (For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) -- judges 8:24
.
They said, "We will surely give them." So they spread out a garment, and every one of them threw an earring there from his spoil. -- judges 8:25
.
The weight of the gold earrings that he requested was 1,shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the neck bands that were on their camels' necks. -- judges 8:26
.
Gideon made it into an ephod, and placed it in his city, Ophrah, and all Israel played the harlot with it there, so that it became a snare to Gideon and his household. -- judges 8:27
.
So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they did not lift up their heads anymore. And the land was undisturbed for forty years in the days of Gideon. -- judges 8:28
.
Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house. -- judges 8:29
.
Now Gideon had seventy sons who were his direct descendants, for he had many wives. -- judges 8:30
.
His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. -- judges 8:31
.
And Gideon the son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. -- judges 8:32
.
Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the sons of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god. -- judges 8:33
.
Thus the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side; -- judges 8:34
.
nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in accord with all the good that he had done to Israel. -- judges 8:35
.
And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's relatives, and spoke to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother's father, saying, -- judges 9:1
.
"Speak, now, in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you?' Also, remember that I am your bone and your flesh." -- judges 9:2
.
And his mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem; and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our relative." -- judges 9:3
.
They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, and they followed him. -- judges 9:4
.
Then he went to his father's house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. -- judges 9:5
.
All the men of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem. -- judges 9:6
.
Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and called out. Thus he said to them, "Listen to me, O men of Shechem, that God may listen to you. -- judges 9:7
.
"Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us!' -- judges 9:8
.
"But the olive tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my fatness with which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?' -- judges 9:9
.
"Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come, reign over us!' -- judges 9:10
.
"But the fig tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?' -- judges 9:11
.
"Then the trees said to the vine, 'You come, reign over us!' -- judges 9:12
.
"But the vine said to them, 'Shall I leave my new wine, which cheers God and men, and go to wave over the trees?' -- judges 9:13
.
"Finally all the trees said to the bramble, 'You come, reign over us!' -- judges 9:14
.
"The bramble said to the trees, 'If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.' -- judges 9:15
.
"Now therefore, if you have dealt in truth and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved-- -- judges 9:16
.
for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian; -- judges 9:17
.
but you have risen against my father's house today and have killed his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your relative-- -- judges 9:18
.
if then you have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. -- judges 9:19
.
"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from Beth-millo, and consume Abimelech." -- judges 9:20
.
Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer and remained there because of Abimelech his brother. -- judges 9:21
.
Now Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. -- judges 9:22
.
Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, -- judges 9:23
.
so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. -- judges 9:24
.
The men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who might pass by them along the road; and it was told to Abimelech. -- judges 9:25
.
Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and crossed over into Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. -- judges 9:26
.
They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards and trod them, and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech. -- judges 9:27
.
Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is Zebul not his lieutenant? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? -- judges 9:28
.
"Would, therefore, that this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech." And he said to Abimelech, "Increase your army and come out." -- judges 9:29
.
When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned. -- judges 9:30
.
He sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and behold, they are stirring up the city against you. -- judges 9:31
.
"Now therefore, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. -- judges 9:32
.
"In the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them whatever you can." -- judges 9:33
.
So Abimelech and all the people who were with him arose by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. -- judges 9:34
.
Now Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate; and Abimelech and the people who were with him arose from the ambush. -- judges 9:35
.
When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains." But Zebul said to him, "You are seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were men." -- judges 9:36
.
Gaal spoke again and said, "Behold, people are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company comes by the way of the diviners' oak." -- judges 9:37
.
Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your boasting now with which you said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is this not the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them!" -- judges 9:38
.
So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. -- judges 9:39
.
Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate. -- judges 9:40
.
Then Abimelech remained at Arumah, but Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem. -- judges 9:41
.
Now it came about the next day, that the people went out to the field, and it was told to Abimelech. -- judges 9:42
.
So he took his people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; when he looked and saw the people coming out from the city, he arose against them and slew them. -- judges 9:43
.
Then Abimelech and the company who was with him dashed forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate; the other two companies then dashed against all who were in the field and slew them. -- judges 9:44
.
Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and he captured the city and killed the people who were in it; then he razed the city and sowed it with salt. -- judges 9:45
.
When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith. -- judges 9:46
.
It was told Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. -- judges 9:47
.
So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, and lifted it and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do likewise." -- judges 9:48
.
All the people also cut down each one his branch and followed Abimelech, and put them on the inner chamber and set the inner chamber on fire over those inside, so that all the men of the tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women. -- judges 9:49
.
Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he camped against Thebez and captured it. -- judges 9:50
.
But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower. -- judges 9:51
.
So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire. -- judges 9:52
.
But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, crushing his skull. -- judges 9:53
.
Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not be said of me, 'A woman slew him.'" So the young man pierced him through, and he died. -- judges 9:54
.
When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each departed to his home. -- judges 9:55
.
Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father in killing his seventy brothers. -- judges 9:56
.
Also God returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them. -- judges 9:57
.
Now after Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. -- judges 10:1
.
He judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir. -- judges 10:2
.
After him, Jair the Gileadite arose and judged Israel twenty-two years. -- judges 10:3
.
He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair to this day. -- judges 10:4
.
And Jair died and was buried in Kamon. -- judges 10:5
.
Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him. -- judges 10:6
.
The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the sons of Ammon. -- judges 10:7
.
They afflicted and crushed the sons of Israel that year; for eighteen years they afflicted all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in Gilead in the land of the Amorites. -- judges 10:8
.
The sons of Ammon crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed. -- judges 10:9
.
Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against You, for indeed, we have forsaken our God and served the Baals." -- judges 10:10
.
The LORD said to the sons of Israel, "Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the sons of Ammon, and the Philistines? -- judges 10:11
.
"Also when the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hands. -- judges 10:12
.
"Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore I will no longer deliver you. -- judges 10:13
.
"Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress." -- judges 10:14
.
The sons of Israel said to the LORD, "We have sinned, do to us whatever seems good to You; only please deliver us this day." -- judges 10:15
.
So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD; and He could bear the misery of Israel no longer. -- judges 10:16
.
Then the sons of Ammon were summoned and they camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel gathered together and camped in Mizpah. -- judges 10:17
.
The people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead." -- judges 10:18
.
Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior, but he was the son of a harlot. And Gilead was the father of Jephthah. -- judges 11:1
.
Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, "You shall not have an inheritance in our father's house, for you are the son of another woman." -- judges 11:2
.
So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; and worthless fellows gathered themselves about Jephthah, and they went out with him. -- judges 11:3
.
It came about after a while that the sons of Ammon fought against Israel. -- judges 11:4
.
When the sons of Ammon fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob; -- judges 11:5
.
and they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our chief that we may fight against the sons of Ammon." -- judges 11:6
.
Then Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me and drive me from my father's house? So why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?" -- judges 11:7
.
The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "For this reason we have now returned to you, that you may go with us and fight with the sons of Ammon and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead." -- judges 11:8
.
So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you take me back to fight against the sons of Ammon and the LORD gives them up to me, will I become your head?" -- judges 11:9
.
The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD is witness between us; surely we will do as you have said." -- judges 11:10
.
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah. -- judges 11:11
.
Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, "What is between you and me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?" -- judges 11:12
.
The king of the sons of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and the Jordan; therefore, return them peaceably now." -- judges 11:13
.
But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon, -- judges 11:14
.
and they said to him, "Thus says Jephthah, 'Israel did not take away the land of Moab nor the land of the sons of Ammon. -- judges 11:15
.
'For when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh, -- judges 11:16
.
then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, "Please let us pass through your land," but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh. -- judges 11:17
.
'Then they went through the wilderness and around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. -- judges 11:18
.
'And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, "Please let us pass through your land to our place." -- judges 11:19
.
'But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people and camped in Jahaz and fought with Israel. -- judges 11:20
.
'The LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. -- judges 11:21
.
'So they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan. -- judges 11:22
.
'Since now the LORD, the God of Israel, drove out the Amorites from before His people Israel, are you then to possess it? -- judges 11:23
.
'Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God has driven out before us, we will possess it. -- judges 11:24
.
'Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive with Israel, or did he ever fight against them? -- judges 11:25
.
'While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time? -- judges 11:26
.
'I therefore have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war against me; may the LORD, the Judge, judge today between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.'" -- judges 11:27
.
But the king of the sons of Ammon disregarded the message which Jephthah sent him. -- judges 11:28
.
Now the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, so that he passed through Gilead and Manasseh; then he passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he went on to the sons of Ammon. -- judges 11:29
.
Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, "If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand, -- judges 11:30
.
then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering." -- judges 11:31
.
So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD gave them into his hand. -- judges 11:32
.
He struck them with a very great slaughter from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel. -- judges 11:33
.
When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. Now she was his one and only child; besides her he had no son or daughter. -- judges 11:34
.
When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are among those who trouble me; for I have given my word to the LORD, and I cannot take it back." -- judges 11:35
.
So she said to him, "My father, you have given your word to the LORD; do to me as you have said, since the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the sons of Ammon." -- judges 11:36
.
She said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go to the mountains and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions." -- judges 11:37
.
Then he said, "Go." So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept on the mountains because of her virginity. -- judges 11:38
.
At the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her according to the vow which he had made; and she had no relations with a man. Thus it became a custom in Israel, -- judges 11:39
.
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year. -- judges 11:40
.
Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you." -- judges 12:1
.
Jephthah said to them, "I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon; when I called you, you did not deliver me from their hand. -- judges 12:2
.
"When I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?" -- judges 12:3
.
Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, O Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh." -- judges 12:4
.
The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. And it happened when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me cross over," the men of Gilead would say to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said, "No," -- judges 12:5
.
then they would say to him, "Say now, 'Shibboleth.'" But he said, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. Thus there fell at that time 42,of Ephraim. -- judges 12:6
.
Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. -- judges 12:7
.
Now Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel after him. -- judges 12:8
.
He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage outside the family, and he brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. -- judges 12:9
.
Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem. -- judges 12:10
.
Now Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel after him; and he judged Israel ten years. -- judges 12:11
.
Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. -- judges 12:12
.
Now Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel after him. -- judges 12:13
.
He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys; and he judged Israel eight years. -- judges 12:14
.
Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. -- judges 12:15
.
Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, so that the LORD gave them into the hands of the Philistines forty years. -- judges 13:1
.
There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had borne no children. -- judges 13:2
.
Then the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, "Behold now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and give birth to a son. -- judges 13:3
.
"Now therefore, be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. -- judges 13:4
.
"For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines." -- judges 13:5
.
Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him where he came from, nor did he tell me his name. -- judges 13:6
.
"But he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.'" -- judges 13:7
.
Then Manoah entreated the LORD and said, "O Lord, please let the man of God whom You have sent come to us again that he may teach us what to do for the boy who is to be born." -- judges 13:8
.
God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. -- judges 13:9
.
So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, "Behold, the man who came the other day has appeared to me." -- judges 13:10
.
Then Manoah arose and followed his wife, and when he came to the man he said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to the woman?" And he said, "I am." -- judges 13:11
.
Manoah said, "Now when your words come to pass, what shall be the boy's mode of life and his vocation?" -- judges 13:12
.
So the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Let the woman pay attention to all that I said. -- judges 13:13
.
"She should not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; let her observe all that I commanded." -- judges 13:14
.
Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please let us detain you so that we may prepare a young goat for you." -- judges 13:15
.
The angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD." For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD. -- judges 13:16
.
Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?" -- judges 13:17
.
But the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?" -- judges 13:18
.
So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, and He performed wonders while Manoah and his wife looked on. -- judges 13:19
.
For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground. -- judges 13:20
.
Now the angel of the LORD did not appear to Manoah or his wife again. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD. -- judges 13:21
.
So Manoah said to his wife, "We will surely die, for we have seen God." -- judges 13:22
.
But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have let us hear things like this at this time." -- judges 13:23
.
Then the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and the child grew up and the LORD blessed him. -- judges 13:24
.
And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. -- judges 13:25
.
Then Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. -- judges 14:1
.
So he came back and told his father and mother, "I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife." -- judges 14:2
.
Then his father and his mother said to him, "Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for she looks good to me." -- judges 14:3
.
However, his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD, for He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel. -- judges 14:4
.
Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion came roaring toward him. -- judges 14:5
.
The Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, so that he tore him as one tears a young goat though he had nothing in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done. -- judges 14:6
.
So he went down and talked to the woman; and she looked good to Samson. -- judges 14:7
.
When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion. -- judges 14:8
.
So he scraped the honey into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it; but he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion. -- judges 14:9
.
Then his father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men customarily did this. -- judges 14:10
.
When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him. -- judges 14:11
.
Then Samson said to them, "Let me now propound a riddle to you; if you will indeed tell it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes. -- judges 14:12
.
"But if you are unable to tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes." And they said to him, "Propound your riddle, that we may hear it." -- judges 14:13
.
So he said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet." But they could not tell the riddle in three days. -- judges 14:14
.
Then it came about on the fourth day that they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband, so that he will tell us the riddle, or we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us? Is this not so?" -- judges 14:15
.
Samson's wife wept before him and said, "You only hate me, and you do not love me; you have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told it to me." And he said to her, "Behold, I have not told it to my father or mother; so should I tell you?" -- judges 14:16
.
However she wept before him seven days while their feast lasted. And on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. She then told the riddle to the sons of her people. -- judges 14:17
.
So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have found out my riddle." -- judges 14:18
.
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of them and took their spoil and gave the changes of clothes to those who told the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father's house. -- judges 14:19
.
But Samson's wife was given to his companion who had been his friend. -- judges 14:20
.
But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat, and said, "I will go in to my wife in her room." But her father did not let him enter. -- judges 15:1
.
Her father said, "I really thought that you hated her intensely; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please let her be yours instead." -- judges 15:2
.
Samson then said to them, "This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm." -- judges 15:3
.
Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch in the middle between two tails. -- judges 15:4
.
When he had set fire to the torches, he released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning up both the shocks and the standing grain, along with the vineyards and groves. -- judges 15:5
.
Then the Philistines said, "Who did this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion." So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. -- judges 15:6
.
Samson said to them, "Since you act like this, I will surely take revenge on you, but after that I will quit." -- judges 15:7
.
He struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam. -- judges 15:8
.
Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah, and spread out in Lehi. -- judges 15:9
.
The men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" And they said, "We have come up to bind Samson in order to do to him as he did to us." -- judges 15:10
.
Then 3,men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" And he said to them, "As they did to me, so I have done to them." -- judges 15:11
.
They said to him, "We have come down to bind you so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not kill me." -- judges 15:12
.
So they said to him, "No, but we will bind you fast and give you into their hands; yet surely we will not kill you." Then they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock. -- judges 15:13
.
When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from his hands. -- judges 15:14
.
He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out and took it and killed a thousand men with it. -- judges 15:15
.
Then Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have killed a thousand men." -- judges 15:16
.
When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi. -- judges 15:17
.
Then he became very thirsty, and he called to the LORD and said, "You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant, and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?" -- judges 15:18
.
But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi so that water came out of it. When he drank, his strength returned and he revived. Therefore he named it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day. -- judges 15:19
.
So he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines. -- judges 15:20
.
Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her. -- judges 16:1
.
When it was told to the Gazites, saying, "Samson has come here," they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. And they kept silent all night, saying, "Let us wait until the morning light, then we will kill him." -- judges 16:2
.
Now Samson lay until midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts and pulled them up along with the bars; then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain which is opposite Hebron. -- judges 16:3
.
After this it came about that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. -- judges 16:4
.
The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, "Entice him, and see where his great strength lies and how we may overpower him that we may bind him to afflict him. Then we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver." -- judges 16:5
.
So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may be bound to afflict you." -- judges 16:6
.
Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have not been dried, then I will become weak and be like any other man." -- judges 16:7
.
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. -- judges 16:8
.
Now she had men lying in wait in an inner room. And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the cords as a string of tow snaps when it touches fire. So his strength was not discovered. -- judges 16:9
.
Then Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have deceived me and told me lies; now please tell me how you may be bound." -- judges 16:10
.
He said to her, "If they bind me tightly with new ropes which have not been used, then I will become weak and be like any other man." -- judges 16:11
.
So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" For the men were lying in wait in the inner room. But he snapped the ropes from his arms like a thread. -- judges 16:12
.
Then Delilah said to Samson, "Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies; tell me how you may be bound." And he said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web [and fasten it with a pin, then I will become weak and be like any other man." -- judges 16:13
.
So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web]. And she fastened it with the pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web. -- judges 16:14
.
Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have deceived me these three times and have not told me where your great strength is." -- judges 16:15
.
It came about when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that his soul was annoyed to death. -- judges 16:16
.
So he told her all that was in his heart and said to her, "A razor has never come on my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me and I will become weak and be like any other man." -- judges 16:17
.
When Delilah saw that he had told her all that was in his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up once more, for he has told me all that is in his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands. -- judges 16:18
.
She made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his hair. Then she began to afflict him, and his strength left him. -- judges 16:19
.
She said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he awoke from his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him. -- judges 16:20
.
Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he was a grinder in the prison. -- judges 16:21
.
However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off. -- judges 16:22
.
Now the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice, for they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands." -- judges 16:23
.
When the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, "Our god has given our enemy into our hands, Even the destroyer of our country, Who has slain many of us." -- judges 16:24
.
It so happened when they were in high spirits, that they said, "Call for Samson, that he may amuse us." So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. And they made him stand between the pillars. -- judges 16:25
.
Then Samson said to the boy who was holding his hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them." -- judges 16:26
.
Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And about 3,men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing them. -- judges 16:27
.
Then Samson called to the LORD and said, "O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me just this time, O God, that I may at once be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes." -- judges 16:28
.
Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left. -- judges 16:29
.
And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" And he bent with all his might so that the house fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed in his life. -- judges 16:30
.
Then his brothers and all his father's household came down, took him, brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. Thus he had judged Israel twenty years. -- judges 16:31
.
Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. -- judges 17:1
.
He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD." -- judges 17:2
.
He then returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, "I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore, I will return them to you." -- judges 17:3
.
So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made them into a graven image and a molten image, and they were in the house of Micah. -- judges 17:4
.
And the man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and household idols and consecrated one of his sons, that he might become his priest. -- judges 17:5
.
In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes. -- judges 17:6
.
Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was staying there. -- judges 17:7
.
Then the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he might find a place; and as he made his journey, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. -- judges 17:8
.
Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I may find a place." -- judges 17:9
.
Micah then said to him, "Dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a suit of clothes, and your maintenance." So the Levite went in. -- judges 17:10
.
The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. -- judges 17:11
.
So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah. -- judges 17:12
.
Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, seeing I have a Levite as priest." -- judges 17:13
.
In those days there was no king of Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for themselves to live in, for until that day an inheritance had not been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel. -- judges 18:1
.
So the sons of Dan sent from their family five men out of their whole number, valiant men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it; and they said to them, "Go, search the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. -- judges 18:2
.
When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned aside there and said to him, "Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?" -- judges 18:3
.
He said to them, "Thus and so has Micah done to me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest." -- judges 18:4
.
They said to him, "Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be prosperous." -- judges 18:5
.
The priest said to them, "Go in peace; your way in which you are going has the LORD'S approval." -- judges 18:6
.
Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were in it living in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no ruler humiliating them for anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. -- judges 18:7
.
When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, "What do you report?" -- judges 18:8
.
They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you sit still? Do not delay to go, to enter, to possess the land. -- judges 18:9
.
"When you enter, you will come to a secure people with a spacious land; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth." -- judges 18:10
.
Then from the family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out. -- judges 18:11
.
They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim. -- judges 18:12
.
They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah. -- judges 18:13
.
Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and household idols and a graven image and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you should do." -- judges 18:14
.
They turned aside there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. -- judges 18:15
.
The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. -- judges 18:16
.
Now the five men who went to spy out the land went up and entered there, and took the graven image and the ephod and household idols and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war. -- judges 18:17
.
When these went into Micah's house and took the graven image, the ephod and household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?" -- judges 18:18
.
They said to him, "Be silent, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?" -- judges 18:19
.
The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod and household idols and the graven image and went among the people. -- judges 18:20
.
Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the valuables in front of them. -- judges 18:21
.
When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house assembled and overtook the sons of Dan. -- judges 18:22
.
They cried to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, "What is the matter with you, that you have assembled together?" -- judges 18:23
.
He said, "You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what do I have besides? So how can you say to me, 'What is the matter with you?'" -- judges 18:24
.
The sons of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, or else fierce men will fall upon you and you will lose your life, with the lives of your household." -- judges 18:25
.
So the sons of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house. -- judges 18:26
.
Then they took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire. -- judges 18:27
.
And there was no one to deliver them, because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley which is near Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it. -- judges 18:28
.
They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born in Israel; however, the name of the city formerly was Laish. -- judges 18:29
.
The sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. -- judges 18:30
.
So they set up for themselves Micah's graven image which he had made, all the time that the house of God was at Shiloh. -- judges 18:31
.
Now it came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself from Bethlehem in Judah. -- judges 19:1
.
But his concubine played the harlot against him, and she went away from him to her father's house in Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months. -- judges 19:2
.
Then her husband arose and went after her to speak tenderly to her in order to bring her back, taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. So she brought him into her father's house, and when the girl's father saw him, he was glad to meet him. -- judges 19:3
.
His father-in-law, the girl's father, detained him; and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there. -- judges 19:4
.
Now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to go; and the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Sustain yourself with a piece of bread, and afterward you may go." -- judges 19:5
.
So both of them sat down and ate and drank together; and the girl's father said to the man, "Please be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry." -- judges 19:6
.
Then the man arose to go, but his father-in-law urged him so that he spent the night there again. -- judges 19:7
.
On the fifth day he arose to go early in the morning, and the girl's father said, "Please sustain yourself, and wait until afternoon"; so both of them ate. -- judges 19:8
.
When the man arose to go along with his concubine and servant, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold now, the day has drawn to a close; please spend the night. Lo, the day is coming to an end; spend the night here that your heart may be merry. Then tomorrow you may arise early for your journey so that you may go home." -- judges 19:9
.
But the man was not willing to spend the night, so he arose and departed and came to a place opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). And there were with him a pair of saddled donkeys; his concubine also was with him. -- judges 19:10
.
When they were near Jebus, the day was almost gone; and the servant said to his master, "Please come, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it." -- judges 19:11
.
However, his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners who are not of the sons of Israel; but we will go on as far as Gibeah." -- judges 19:12
.
He said to his servant, "Come and let us approach one of these places; and we will spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah." -- judges 19:13
.
So they passed along and went their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin. -- judges 19:14
.
They turned aside there in order to enter and lodge in Gibeah. When they entered, they sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night. -- judges 19:15
.
Then behold, an old man was coming out of the field from his work at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was staying in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites. -- judges 19:16
.
And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, "Where are you going, and where do you come from?" -- judges 19:17
.
He said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, for I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem in Judah. But I am now going to my house, and no man will take me into his house. -- judges 19:18
.
"Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your maidservant, and the young man who is with your servants; there is no lack of anything." -- judges 19:19
.
The old man said, "Peace to you. Only let me take care of all your needs; however, do not spend the night in the open square." -- judges 19:20
.
So he took him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank. -- judges 19:21
.
While they were celebrating, behold, the men of the city, certain worthless fellows, surrounded the house, pounding the door; and they spoke to the owner of the house, the old man, saying, "Bring out the man who came into your house that we may have relations with him." -- judges 19:22
.
Then the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my fellows, please do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not commit this act of folly. -- judges 19:23
.
"Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Please let me bring them out that you may ravish them and do to them whatever you wish. But do not commit such an act of folly against this man." -- judges 19:24
.
But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them; and they raped her and abused her all night until morning, then let her go at the approach of dawn. -- judges 19:25
.
As the day began to dawn, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man's house where her master was, until full daylight. -- judges 19:26
.
When her master arose in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, then behold, his concubine was lying at the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold. -- judges 19:27
.
He said to her, "Get up and let us go," but there was no answer. Then he placed her on the donkey; and the man arose and went to his home. -- judges 19:28
.
When he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine and cut her in twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel. -- judges 19:29
.
All who saw it said, "Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen from the day when the sons of Israel came up from the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel and speak up!" -- judges 19:30
.
Then all the sons of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, came out, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah. -- judges 20:1
.
The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, took their stand in the assembly of the people of God, 400,foot soldiers who drew the sword. -- judges 20:2
.
(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this wickedness take place?" -- judges 20:3
.
So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, "I came with my concubine to spend the night at Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin. -- judges 20:4
.
"But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me; instead, they ravished my concubine so that she died. -- judges 20:5
.
"And I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel's inheritance; for they have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. -- judges 20:6
.
"Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here." -- judges 20:7
.
Then all the people arose as one man, saying, "Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house. -- judges 20:8
.
"But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up against it by lot. -- judges 20:9
.
"And we will take men out of 100 throughout the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 1,000, and 1,000 out of 10,000 to supply food for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may punish them for all the disgraceful acts that they have committed in Israel." -- judges 20:10
.
Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man. -- judges 20:11
.
Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this wickedness that has taken place among you? -- judges 20:12
.
"Now then, deliver up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove this wickedness from Israel." But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel. -- judges 20:13
.
The sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel. -- judges 20:14
.
From the cities on that day the sons of Benjamin were numbered, 26,men who draw the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who were numbered, 700 choice men. -- judges 20:15
.
Out of all these people choice men were left-handed; each one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. -- judges 20:16
.
Then the men of Israel besides Benjamin were numbered, 400,men who draw the sword; all these were men of war. -- judges 20:17
.
Now the sons of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God and said, "Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin?" Then the LORD said, "Judah shall go up first." -- judges 20:18
.
So the sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah. -- judges 20:19
.
The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel arrayed for battle against them at Gibeah. -- judges 20:20
.
Then the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and felled to the ground on that day 22,men of Israel. -- judges 20:21
.
But the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and arrayed for battle again in the place where they had arrayed themselves the first day. -- judges 20:22
.
The sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall we again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against him." -- judges 20:23
.
Then the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day. -- judges 20:24
.
Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah the second day and felled to the ground again 18,men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword. -- judges 20:25
.
Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept; thus they remained there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. -- judges 20:26
.
The sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, -- judges 20:27
.
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, Aaron's son, stood before it to minister in those days), saying, "Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand." -- judges 20:28
.
So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. -- judges 20:29
.
The sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as at other times. -- judges 20:30
.
The sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times, on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the field, about thirty men of Israel. -- judges 20:31
.
The sons of Benjamin said, "They are struck down before us, as at the first." But the sons of Israel said, "Let us flee that we may draw them away from the city to the highways." -- judges 20:32
.
Then all the men of Israel arose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel in ambush broke out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba. -- judges 20:33
.
When ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, the battle became fierce; but Benjamin did not know that disaster was close to them. -- judges 20:34
.
And the LORD struck Benjamin before Israel, so that the sons of Israel destroyed 25,men of Benjamin that day, all who draw the sword. -- judges 20:35
.
So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah, -- judges 20:36
.
the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush also deployed and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. -- judges 20:37
.
Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city. -- judges 20:38
.
Then the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle." -- judges 20:39
.
But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them; and behold, the whole city was going up in smoke to heaven. -- judges 20:40
.
Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified; for they saw that disaster was close to them. -- judges 20:41
.
Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them while those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them. -- judges 20:42
.
They surrounded Benjamin, pursued them without rest and trod them down opposite Gibeah toward the east. -- judges 20:43
.
Thus 18,men of Benjamin fell; all these were valiant warriors. -- judges 20:44
.
The rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they caught 5,of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and killed 2,000 of them. -- judges 20:45
.
So all of Benjamin who fell that day were 25,men who draw the sword; all these were valiant warriors. -- judges 20:46
.
But men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon four months. -- judges 20:47
.
The men of Israel then turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city with the cattle and all that they found; they also set on fire all the cities which they found. -- judges 20:48
.
Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, "None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage." -- judges 21:1
.
So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. -- judges 21:2
.
They said, "Why, O LORD, God of Israel, has this come about in Israel, so that one tribe should be missing today in Israel?" -- judges 21:3
.
It came about the next day that the people arose early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. -- judges 21:4
.
Then the sons of Israel said, "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death." -- judges 21:5
.
And the sons of Israel were sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel today. -- judges 21:6
.
"What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?" -- judges 21:7
.
And they said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?" And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. -- judges 21:8
.
For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. -- judges 21:9
.
And the congregation sent 12,of the valiant warriors there, and commanded them, saying, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. -- judges 21:10
.
"This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every man and every woman who has lain with a man." -- judges 21:11
.
And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. -- judges 21:12
.
Then the whole congregation sent word and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them. -- judges 21:13
.
Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; yet they were not enough for them. -- judges 21:14
.
And the people were sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. -- judges 21:15
.
Then the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?" -- judges 21:16
.
They said, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe will not be blotted out from Israel. -- judges 21:17
.
"But we cannot give them wives of our daughters." For the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, "Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin." -- judges 21:18
.
So they said, "Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south side of Lebonah." -- judges 21:19
.
And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, -- judges 21:20
.
and watch; and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, then you shall come out of the vineyards and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. -- judges 21:21
.
"It shall come about, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we shall say to them, 'Give them to us voluntarily, because we did not take for each man of Benjamin a wife in battle, nor did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.'" -- judges 21:22
.
The sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from those who danced, whom they carried away. And they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the cities and lived in them. -- judges 21:23
.
The sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and each one of them went out from there to his inheritance. -- judges 21:24
.
In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. -- judges 21:25
.
Now it came about in the days when the judges governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons. -- ruth 1:1
.
The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. Now they entered the land of Moab and remained there. -- ruth 1:2
.
Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons. -- ruth 1:3
.
They took for themselves Moabite women as wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. And they lived there about ten years. -- ruth 1:4
.
Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was bereft of her two children and her husband. -- ruth 1:5
.
Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that the LORD had visited His people in giving them food. -- ruth 1:6
.
So she departed from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. -- ruth 1:7
.
And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me. -- ruth 1:8
.
"May the LORD grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband." Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. -- ruth 1:9
.
And they said to her, "No, but we will surely return with you to your people." -- ruth 1:10
.
But Naomi said, "Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? -- ruth 1:11
.
"Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight and also bear sons, -- ruth 1:12
.
would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is harder for me than for you, for the hand of the LORD has gone forth against me." -- ruth 1:13
.
And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. -- ruth 1:14
.
Then she said, "Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law." -- ruth 1:15
.
But Ruth said, "Do not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God. -- ruth 1:16
.
"Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Thus may the LORD do to me, and worse, if anything but death parts you and me." -- ruth 1:17
.
When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her. -- ruth 1:18
.
So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said, "Is this Naomi?" -- ruth 1:19
.
She said to them, "Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. -- ruth 1:20
.
"I went out full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has witnessed against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?" -- ruth 1:21
.
So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest. -- ruth 1:22
.
Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. -- ruth 2:1
.
And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter." -- ruth 2:2
.
So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. -- ruth 2:3
.
Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, "May the LORD be with you." And they said to him, "May the LORD bless you." -- ruth 2:4
.
Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?" -- ruth 2:5
.
The servant in charge of the reapers replied, "She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab. -- ruth 2:6
.
"And she said, 'Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.' Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has been sitting in the house for a little while." -- ruth 2:7
.
Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my maids. -- ruth 2:8
.
"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw." -- ruth 2:9
.
Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?" -- ruth 2:10
.
Boaz replied to her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know. -- ruth 2:11
.
"May the LORD reward your work, and your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge." -- ruth 2:12
.
Then she said, "I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants." -- ruth 2:13
.
At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar." So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left. -- ruth 2:14
.
When she rose to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her. -- ruth 2:15
.
"Also you shall purposely pull out for her some grain from the bundles and leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her." -- ruth 2:16
.
So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. -- ruth 2:17
.
She took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took it out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied. -- ruth 2:18
.
Her mother-in-law then said to her, "Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed." So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, "The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz." -- ruth 2:19
.
Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed of the LORD who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead." Again Naomi said to her, "The man is our relative, he is one of our closest relatives." -- ruth 2:20
.
Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "Furthermore, he said to me, 'You should stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.'" -- ruth 2:21
.
Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maids, so that others do not fall upon you in another field." -- ruth 2:22
.
So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law. -- ruth 2:23
.
Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you? -- ruth 3:1
.
"Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. -- ruth 3:2
.
"Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. -- ruth 3:3
.
"It shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do." -- ruth 3:4
.
She said to her, "All that you say I will do." -- ruth 3:5
.
So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her. -- ruth 3:6
.
When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down. -- ruth 3:7
.
It happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet. -- ruth 3:8
.
He said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth your maid. So spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative." -- ruth 3:9
.
Then he said, "May you be blessed of the LORD, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich. -- ruth 3:10
.
"Now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence. -- ruth 3:11
.
"Now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I. -- ruth 3:12
.
"Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until morning." -- ruth 3:13
.
So she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor." -- ruth 3:14
.
Again he said, "Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it." So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city. -- ruth 3:15
.
When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?" And she told her all that the man had done for her. -- ruth 3:16
.
She said, "These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, 'Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'" -- ruth 3:17
.
Then she said, "Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today." -- ruth 3:18
.
Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, "Turn aside, friend, sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down. -- ruth 4:1
.
He took ten men of the elders of the city and said, "Sit down here." So they sat down. -- ruth 4:2
.
Then he said to the closest relative, "Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has to sell the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech. -- ruth 4:3
.
"So I thought to inform you, saying, 'Buy it before those who are sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if not, tell me that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am after you.'" And he said, "I will redeem it." -- ruth 4:4
.
Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance." -- ruth 4:5
.
The closest relative said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, because I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem it for yourself; you may have my right of redemption, for I cannot redeem it." -- ruth 4:6
.
Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange of land to confirm any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave it to another; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel. -- ruth 4:7
.
So the closest relative said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself." And he removed his sandal. -- ruth 4:8
.
Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. -- ruth 4:9
.
"Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his birth place; you are witnesses today." -- ruth 4:10
.
All the people who were in the court, and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem. -- ruth 4:11
.
"Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring which the LORD will give you by this young woman." -- ruth 4:12
.
So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her. And the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. -- ruth 4:13
.
Then the women said to Naomi, "Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel. -- ruth 4:14
.
"May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him." -- ruth 4:15
.
Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse. -- ruth 4:16
.
The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi!" So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David. -- ruth 4:17
.
Now these are the generations of Perez: to Perez was born Hezron, -- ruth 4:18
.
and to Hezron was born Ram, and to Ram, Amminadab, -- ruth 4:19
.
and to Amminadab was born Nahshon, and to Nahshon, Salmon, -- ruth 4:20
.
and to Salmon was born Boaz, and to Boaz, Obed, -- ruth 4:21
.
and to Obed was born Jesse, and to Jesse, David. -- ruth 4:22
.
Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. -- 1 samuel 1:1
.
He had two wives: the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. -- 1 samuel 1:2
.
Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD there. -- 1 samuel 1:3
.
When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters; -- 1 samuel 1:4
.
but to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had closed her womb. -- 1 samuel 1:5
.
Her rival, however, would provoke her bitterly to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb. -- 1 samuel 1:6
.
It happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she would provoke her; so she wept and would not eat. -- 1 samuel 1:7
.
Then Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?" -- 1 samuel 1:8
.
Then Hannah rose after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 1:9
.
She, greatly distressed, prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly. -- 1 samuel 1:10
.
She made a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and a razor shall never come on his head." -- 1 samuel 1:11
.
Now it came about, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth. -- 1 samuel 1:12
.
As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk. -- 1 samuel 1:13
.
Then Eli said to her, "How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you." -- 1 samuel 1:14
.
But Hannah replied, "No, my lord, I am a woman oppressed in spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD. -- 1 samuel 1:15
.
"Do not consider your maidservant as a worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation." -- 1 samuel 1:16
.
Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him." -- 1 samuel 1:17
.
She said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your sight." So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad. -- 1 samuel 1:18
.
Then they arose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, and returned again to their house in Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her. -- 1 samuel 1:19
.
It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, "Because I have asked him of the LORD." -- 1 samuel 1:20
.
Then the man Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow. -- 1 samuel 1:21
.
But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "I will not go up until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD and stay there forever." -- 1 samuel 1:22
.
Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you. Remain until you have weaned him; only may the LORD confirm His word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. -- 1 samuel 1:23
.
Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull and one ephah of flour and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh, although the child was young. -- 1 samuel 1:24
.
Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the boy to Eli. -- 1 samuel 1:25
.
She said, "Oh, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the LORD. -- 1 samuel 1:26
.
"For this boy I prayed, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of Him. -- 1 samuel 1:27
.
"So I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there. -- 1 samuel 1:28
.
Then Hannah prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; My horn is exalted in the LORD, My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, Because I rejoice in Your salvation. -- 1 samuel 2:1
.
"There is no one holy like the LORD, Indeed, there is no one besides You, Nor is there any rock like our God. -- 1 samuel 2:2
.
"Boast no more so very proudly, Do not let arrogance come out of your mouth; For the LORD is a God of knowledge, And with Him actions are weighed. -- 1 samuel 2:3
.
"The bows of the mighty are shattered, But the feeble gird on strength. -- 1 samuel 2:4
.
"Those who were full hire themselves out for bread, But those who were hungry cease to hunger. Even the barren gives birth to seven, But she who has many children languishes. -- 1 samuel 2:5
.
"The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up. -- 1 samuel 2:6
.
"The LORD makes poor and rich; He brings low, He also exalts. -- 1 samuel 2:7
.
"He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the ash heap To make them sit with nobles, And inherit a seat of honor; For the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, And He set the world on them. -- 1 samuel 2:8
.
"He keeps the feet of His godly ones, But the wicked ones are silenced in darkness; For not by might shall a man prevail. -- 1 samuel 2:9
.
"Those who contend with the LORD will be shattered; Against them He will thunder in the heavens, The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; And He will give strength to His king, And will exalt the horn of His anointed." -- 1 samuel 2:10
.
Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But the boy ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest. -- 1 samuel 2:11
.
Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they did not know the LORD -- 1 samuel 2:12
.
and the custom of the priests with the people. When any man was offering a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand. -- 1 samuel 2:13
.
Then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. -- 1 samuel 2:14
.
Also, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest meat for roasting, as he will not take boiled meat from you, only raw." -- 1 samuel 2:15
.
If the man said to him, "They must surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as you desire," then he would say, "No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force." -- 1 samuel 2:16
.
Thus the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for the men despised the offering of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 2:17
.
Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD, as a boy wearing a linen ephod. -- 1 samuel 2:18
.
And his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. -- 1 samuel 2:19
.
Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, "May the LORD give you children from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD." And they went to their own home. -- 1 samuel 2:20
.
The LORD visited Hannah; and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before the LORD. -- 1 samuel 2:21
.
Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting. -- 1 samuel 2:22
.
He said to them, "Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people? -- 1 samuel 2:23
.
"No, my sons; for the report is not good which I hear the LORD'S people circulating. -- 1 samuel 2:24
.
"If one man sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?" But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for the LORD desired to put them to death. -- 1 samuel 2:25
.
Now the boy Samuel was growing in stature and in favor both with the LORD and with men. -- 1 samuel 2:26
.
Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Did I not indeed reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house? -- 1 samuel 2:27
.
'Did I not choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My priests, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod before Me; and did I not give to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel? -- 1 samuel 2:28
.
'Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling, and honor your sons above Me, by making yourselves fat with the choicest of every offering of My people Israel?' -- 1 samuel 2:29
.
"Therefore the LORD God of Israel declares, 'I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father should walk before Me forever'; but now the LORD declares, 'Far be it from Me--for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me will be lightly esteemed. -- 1 samuel 2:30
.
'Behold, the days are coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father's house so that there will not be an old man in your house. -- 1 samuel 2:31
.
'You will see the distress of My dwelling, in spite of all the good that I do for Israel; and an old man will not be in your house forever. -- 1 samuel 2:32
.
'Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar so that your eyes will fail from weeping and your soul grieve, and all the increase of your house will die in the prime of life. -- 1 samuel 2:33
.
'This will be the sign to you which will come concerning your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both of them will die. -- 1 samuel 2:34
.
'But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and in My soul; and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed always. -- 1 samuel 2:35
.
'Everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and say, "Please assign me to one of the priest's offices so that I may eat a piece of bread."'" -- 1 samuel 2:36
.
Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD before Eli. And word from the LORD was rare in those days, visions were infrequent. -- 1 samuel 3:1
.
It happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyesight had begun to grow dim and he could not see well), -- 1 samuel 3:2
.
and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was, -- 1 samuel 3:3
.
that the LORD called Samuel; and he said, "Here I am." -- 1 samuel 3:4
.
Then he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call, lie down again." So he went and lay down. -- 1 samuel 3:5
.
The LORD called yet again, "Samuel!" So Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he answered, "I did not call, my son, lie down again." -- 1 samuel 3:6
.
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, nor had the word of the LORD yet been revealed to him. -- 1 samuel 3:7
.
So the LORD called Samuel again for the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." Then Eli discerned that the LORD was calling the boy. -- 1 samuel 3:8
.
And Eli said to Samuel, "Go lie down, and it shall be if He calls you, that you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place. -- 1 samuel 3:9
.
Then the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, for Your servant is listening." -- 1 samuel 3:10
.
The LORD said to Samuel, "Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. -- 1 samuel 3:11
.
"In that day I will carry out against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. -- 1 samuel 3:12
.
"For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them. -- 1 samuel 3:13
.
"Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever." -- 1 samuel 3:14
.
So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. -- 1 samuel 3:15
.
Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he said, "Here I am." -- 1 samuel 3:16
.
He said, "What is the word that He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the words that He spoke to you." -- 1 samuel 3:17
.
So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, "It is the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him." -- 1 samuel 3:18
.
Thus Samuel grew and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fail. -- 1 samuel 3:19
.
All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 3:20
.
And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, because the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 3:21
.
Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer while the Philistines camped in Aphek. -- 1 samuel 4:1
.
The Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield. -- 1 samuel 4:2
.
When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us take to ourselves from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that it may come among us and deliver us from the power of our enemies." -- 1 samuel 4:3
.
So the people sent to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts who sits above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. -- 1 samuel 4:4
.
As the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded. -- 1 samuel 4:5
.
When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, "What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp. -- 1 samuel 4:6
.
The Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come into the camp." And they said, "Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. -- 1 samuel 4:7
.
"Woe to us! Who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. -- 1 samuel 4:8
.
"Take courage and be men, O Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you; therefore, be men and fight." -- 1 samuel 4:9
.
So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the slaughter was very great, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers. -- 1 samuel 4:10
.
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died. -- 1 samuel 4:11
.
Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head. -- 1 samuel 4:12
.
When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road eagerly watching, because his heart was trembling for the ark of God. So the man came to tell it in the city, and all the city cried out. -- 1 samuel 4:13
.
When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, "What does the noise of this commotion mean?" Then the man came hurriedly and told Eli. -- 1 samuel 4:14
.
Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set so that he could not see. -- 1 samuel 4:15
.
The man said to Eli, "I am the one who came from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today." And he said, "How did things go, my son?" -- 1 samuel 4:16
.
Then the one who brought the news replied, "Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken." -- 1 samuel 4:17
.
When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. Thus he judged Israel forty years. -- 1 samuel 4:18
.
Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas's wife, was pregnant and about to give birth; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, for her pains came upon her. -- 1 samuel 4:19
.
And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, "Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son." But she did not answer or pay attention. -- 1 samuel 4:20
.
And she called the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband. -- 1 samuel 4:21
.
She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God was taken." -- 1 samuel 4:22
.
Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. -- 1 samuel 5:1
.
Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon. -- 1 samuel 5:2
.
When the Ashdodites arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set him in his place again. -- 1 samuel 5:3
.
But when they arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. And the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him. -- 1 samuel 5:4
.
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor all who enter Dagon's house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day. -- 1 samuel 5:5
.
Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the Ashdodites, and He ravaged them and smote them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territories. -- 1 samuel 5:6
.
When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god." -- 1 samuel 5:7
.
So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" And they said, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath." And they brought the ark of the God of Israel around. -- 1 samuel 5:8
.
After they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city with very great confusion; and He smote the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them. -- 1 samuel 5:9
.
So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as the ark of God came to Ekron the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought the ark of the God of Israel around to us, to kill us and our people." -- 1 samuel 5:10
.
They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, so that it will not kill us and our people." For there was a deadly confusion throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. -- 1 samuel 5:11
.
And the men who did not die were smitten with tumors and the cry of the city went up to heaven. -- 1 samuel 5:12
.
Now the ark of the LORD had been in the country of the Philistines seven months. -- 1 samuel 6:1
.
And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we shall send it to its place." -- 1 samuel 6:2
.
They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but you shall surely return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you." -- 1 samuel 6:3
.
Then they said, "What shall be the guilt offering which we shall return to Him?" And they said, "Five golden tumors and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on all of you and on your lords. -- 1 samuel 6:4
.
"So you shall make likenesses of your tumors and likenesses of your mice that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will ease His hand from you, your gods, and your land. -- 1 samuel 6:5
.
"Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them, did they not allow the people to go, and they departed? -- 1 samuel 6:6
.
"Now therefore, take and prepare a new cart and two milch cows on which there has never been a yoke; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves home, away from them. -- 1 samuel 6:7
.
"Take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you return to Him as a guilt offering in a box by its side. Then send it away that it may go. -- 1 samuel 6:8
.
"Watch, if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance." -- 1 samuel 6:9
.
Then the men did so, and took two milch cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. -- 1 samuel 6:10
.
They put the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the box with the golden mice and the likenesses of their tumors. -- 1 samuel 6:11
.
And the cows took the straight way in the direction of Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh. -- 1 samuel 6:12
.
Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley, and they raised their eyes and saw the ark and were glad to see it. -- 1 samuel 6:13
.
The cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stood there where there was a large stone; and they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. -- 1 samuel 6:14
.
The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices that day to the LORD. -- 1 samuel 6:15
.
When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron that day. -- 1 samuel 6:16
.
These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron; -- 1 samuel 6:17
.
and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages. The large stone on which they set the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite. -- 1 samuel 6:18
.
He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck down of all the people, 50,men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter. -- 1 samuel 6:19
.
The men of Beth-shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up from us?" -- 1 samuel 6:20
.
So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up to you." -- 1 samuel 6:21
.
And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 7:1
.
From the day that the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim, the time was long, for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. -- 1 samuel 7:2
.
Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, "If you return to the LORD with all your heart, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your hearts to the LORD and serve Him alone; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines." -- 1 samuel 7:3
.
So the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the LORD alone. -- 1 samuel 7:4
.
Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the LORD for you." -- 1 samuel 7:5
.
They gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day and said there, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah. -- 1 samuel 7:6
.
Now when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. -- 1 samuel 7:7
.
Then the sons of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines." -- 1 samuel 7:8
.
Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel and the LORD answered him. -- 1 samuel 7:9
.
Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were routed before Israel. -- 1 samuel 7:10
.
The men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as below Beth-car. -- 1 samuel 7:11
.
Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far the LORD has helped us." -- 1 samuel 7:12
.
So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. -- 1 samuel 7:13
.
The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. So there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. -- 1 samuel 7:14
.
Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. -- 1 samuel 7:15
.
He used to go annually on circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places. -- 1 samuel 7:16
.
Then his return was to Ramah, for his house was there, and there he judged Israel; and he built there an altar to the LORD. -- 1 samuel 7:17
.
And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel. -- 1 samuel 8:1
.
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judging in Beersheba. -- 1 samuel 8:2
.
His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain and took bribes and perverted justice. -- 1 samuel 8:3
.
Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah; -- 1 samuel 8:4
.
and they said to him, "Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations." -- 1 samuel 8:5
.
But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed to the LORD. -- 1 samuel 8:6
.
The LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being king over them. -- 1 samuel 8:7
.
"Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day--in that they have forsaken Me and served other gods--so they are doing to you also. -- 1 samuel 8:8
.
"Now then, listen to their voice; however, you shall solemnly warn them and tell them of the procedure of the king who will reign over them." -- 1 samuel 8:9
.
So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who had asked of him a king. -- 1 samuel 8:10
.
He said, "This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and place them for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots. -- 1 samuel 8:11
.
"He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties, and some to do his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. -- 1 samuel 8:12
.
"He will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers. -- 1 samuel 8:13
.
"He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his servants. -- 1 samuel 8:14
.
"He will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants. -- 1 samuel 8:15
.
"He will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use them for his work. -- 1 samuel 8:16
.
"He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants. -- 1 samuel 8:17
.
"Then you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that day." -- 1 samuel 8:18
.
Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, "No, but there shall be a king over us, -- 1 samuel 8:19
.
that we also may be like all the nations, that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles." -- 1 samuel 8:20
.
Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the LORD'S hearing. -- 1 samuel 8:21
.
The LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to their voice and appoint them a king." So Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Go every man to his city." -- 1 samuel 8:22
.
Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor. -- 1 samuel 9:1
.
He had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and handsome man, and there was not a more handsome person than he among the sons of Israel; from his shoulders and up he was taller than any of the people. -- 1 samuel 9:2
.
Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, "Take now with you one of the servants, and arise, go search for the donkeys." -- 1 samuel 9:3
.
He passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them. -- 1 samuel 9:4
.
When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, or else my father will cease to be concerned about the donkeys and will become anxious for us." -- 1 samuel 9:5
.
He said to him, "Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is held in honor; all that he says surely comes true. Now let us go there, perhaps he can tell us about our journey on which we have set out." -- 1 samuel 9:6
.
Then Saul said to his servant, "But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sack and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?" -- 1 samuel 9:7
.
The servant answered Saul again and said, "Behold, I have in my hand a fourth of a shekel of silver; I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us our way." -- 1 samuel 9:8
.
(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he used to say, "Come, and let us go to the seer"; for he who is called a prophet now was formerly called a seer.) -- 1 samuel 9:9
.
Then Saul said to his servant, "Well said; come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was. -- 1 samuel 9:10
.
As they went up the slope to the city, they found young women going out to draw water and said to them, "Is the seer here?" -- 1 samuel 9:11
.
They answered them and said, "He is; see, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come into the city today, for the people have a sacrifice on the high place today. -- 1 samuel 9:12
.
"As soon as you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up for you will find him at once." -- 1 samuel 9:13
.
So they went up to the city. As they came into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place. -- 1 samuel 9:14
.
Now a day before Saul's coming, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel saying, -- 1 samuel 9:15
.
"About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over My people Israel; and he will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have regarded My people, because their cry has come to Me." -- 1 samuel 9:16
.
When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, "Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people." -- 1 samuel 9:17
.
Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is." -- 1 samuel 9:18
.
Samuel answered Saul and said, "I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is on your mind. -- 1 samuel 9:19
.
"As for your donkeys which were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's household?" -- 1 samuel 9:20
.
Saul replied, "Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me in this way?" -- 1 samuel 9:21
.
Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, who were about thirty men. -- 1 samuel 9:22
.
Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion that I gave you, concerning which I said to you, 'Set it aside.'" -- 1 samuel 9:23
.
Then the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, "Here is what has been reserved! Set it before you and eat, because it has been kept for you until the appointed time, since I said I have invited the people." So Saul ate with Samuel that day. -- 1 samuel 9:24
.
When they came down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof. -- 1 samuel 9:25
.
And they arose early; and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, "Get up, that I may send you away." So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street. -- 1 samuel 9:26
.
As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Say to the servant that he might go ahead of us and pass on, but you remain standing now, that I may proclaim the word of God to you." -- 1 samuel 9:27
.
Then Samuel took the flask of oil, poured it on his head, kissed him and said, "Has not the LORD anointed you a ruler over His inheritance? -- 1 samuel 10:1
.
"When you go from me today, then you will find two men close to Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, 'The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. Now behold, your father has ceased to be concerned about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, "What shall I do about my son?"' -- 1 samuel 10:2
.
"Then you will go on further from there, and you will come as far as the oak of Tabor, and there three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a jug of wine; -- 1 samuel 10:3
.
and they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from their hand. -- 1 samuel 10:4
.
"Afterward you will come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is; and it shall be as soon as you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and a lyre before them, and they will be prophesying. -- 1 samuel 10:5
.
"Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you mightily, and you shall prophesy with them and be changed into another man. -- 1 samuel 10:6
.
"It shall be when these signs come to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires, for God is with you. -- 1 samuel 10:7
.
"And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you should do." -- 1 samuel 10:8
.
Then it happened when he turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart; and all those signs came about on that day. -- 1 samuel 10:9
.
When they came to the hill there, behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him mightily, so that he prophesied among them. -- 1 samuel 10:10
.
It came about, when all who knew him previously saw that he prophesied now with the prophets, that the people said to one another, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?" -- 1 samuel 10:11
.
A man there said, "Now, who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?" -- 1 samuel 10:12
.
When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place. -- 1 samuel 10:13
.
Now Saul's uncle said to him and his servant, "Where did you go?" And he said, "To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they could not be found, we went to Samuel." -- 1 samuel 10:14
.
Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you." -- 1 samuel 10:15
.
So Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned. -- 1 samuel 10:16
.
Thereafter Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah; -- 1 samuel 10:17
.
and he said to the sons of Israel, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.' -- 1 samuel 10:18
.
"But you have today rejected your God, who delivers you from all your calamities and your distresses; yet you have said, 'No, but set a king over us!' Now therefore, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans." -- 1 samuel 10:19
.
Thus Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. -- 1 samuel 10:20
.
Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the Matrite family was taken. And Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they looked for him, he could not be found. -- 1 samuel 10:21
.
Therefore they inquired further of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" So the LORD said, "Behold, he is hiding himself by the baggage." -- 1 samuel 10:22
.
So they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. -- 1 samuel 10:23
.
Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? Surely there is no one like him among all the people." So all the people shouted and said, "Long live the king!" -- 1 samuel 10:24
.
Then Samuel told the people the ordinances of the kingdom, and wrote them in the book and placed it before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his house. -- 1 samuel 10:25
.
Saul also went to his house at Gibeah; and the valiant men whose hearts God had touched went with him. -- 1 samuel 10:26
.
But certain worthless men said, "How can this one deliver us?" And they despised him and did not bring him any present. But he kept silent. -- 1 samuel 10:27
.
Now Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a covenant with us and we will serve you." -- 1 samuel 11:1
.
But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "I will make it with you on this condition, that I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you, thus I will make it a reproach on all Israel." -- 1 samuel 11:2
.
The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Let us alone for seven days, that we may send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to deliver us, we will come out to you." -- 1 samuel 11:3
.
Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people lifted up their voices and wept. -- 1 samuel 11:4
.
Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, and he said, "What is the matter with the people that they weep?" So they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh. -- 1 samuel 11:5
.
Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard these words, and he became very angry. -- 1 samuel 11:6
.
He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, "Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen." Then the dread of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out as one man. -- 1 samuel 11:7
.
He numbered them in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were 300,000, and the men of Judah 30,000. -- 1 samuel 11:8
.
They said to the messengers who had come, "Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will have deliverance.'" So the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. -- 1 samuel 11:9
.
Then the men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you." -- 1 samuel 11:10
.
The next morning Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together. -- 1 samuel 11:11
.
Then the people said to Samuel, "Who is he that said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring the men, that we may put them to death." -- 1 samuel 11:12
.
But Saul said, "Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has accomplished deliverance in Israel." -- 1 samuel 11:13
.
Then Samuel said to the people, "Come and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there." -- 1 samuel 11:14
.
So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they also offered sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. -- 1 samuel 11:15
.
Then Samuel said to all Israel, "Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me and I have appointed a king over you. -- 1 samuel 12:1
.
"Now, here is the king walking before you, but I am old and gray, and behold my sons are with you. And I have walked before you from my youth even to this day. -- 1 samuel 12:2
.
"Here I am; bear witness against me before the LORD and His anointed. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? I will restore it to you." -- 1 samuel 12:3
.
They said, "You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand." -- 1 samuel 12:4
.
He said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day that you have found nothing in my hand." And they said, "He is witness." -- 1 samuel 12:5
.
Then Samuel said to the people, "It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt. -- 1 samuel 12:6
.
"So now, take your stand, that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did for you and your fathers. -- 1 samuel 12:7
.
"When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place. -- 1 samuel 12:8
.
"But they forgot the LORD their God, so He sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. -- 1 samuel 12:9
.
"They cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve You.' -- 1 samuel 12:10
.
"Then the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around, so that you lived in security. -- 1 samuel 12:11
.
"When you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us,' although the LORD your God was your king. -- 1 samuel 12:12
.
"Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for, and behold, the LORD has set a king over you. -- 1 samuel 12:13
.
"If you will fear the LORD and serve Him, and listen to His voice and not rebel against the command of the LORD, then both you and also the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God. -- 1 samuel 12:14
.
"If you will not listen to the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the command of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you, as it was against your fathers. -- 1 samuel 12:15
.
"Even now, take your stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes. -- 1 samuel 12:16
.
"Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call to the LORD, that He may send thunder and rain. Then you will know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the LORD by asking for yourselves a king." -- 1 samuel 12:17
.
So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. -- 1 samuel 12:18
.
Then all the people said to Samuel, "Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, so that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil by asking for ourselves a king." -- 1 samuel 12:19
.
Samuel said to the people, "Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. -- 1 samuel 12:20
.
"You must not turn aside, for then you would go after futile things which can not profit or deliver, because they are futile. -- 1 samuel 12:21
.
"For the LORD will not abandon His people on account of His great name, because the LORD has been pleased to make you a people for Himself. -- 1 samuel 12:22
.
"Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way. -- 1 samuel 12:23
.
"Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you. -- 1 samuel 12:24
.
"But if you still do wickedly, both you and your king will be swept away." -- 1 samuel 12:25
.
Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty two years over Israel. -- 1 samuel 13:1
.
Now Saul chose for himself 3,men of Israel, of which 2,000 were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while 1,000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent. -- 1 samuel 13:2
.
Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear." -- 1 samuel 13:3
.
All Israel heard the news that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. The people were then summoned to Saul at Gilgal. -- 1 samuel 13:4
.
Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, 30,chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance; and they came up and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven. -- 1 samuel 13:5
.
When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard-pressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in cliffs, in cellars, and in pits. -- 1 samuel 13:6
.
Also some of the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. But as for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. -- 1 samuel 13:7
.
Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him. -- 1 samuel 13:8
.
So Saul said, "Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering. -- 1 samuel 13:9
.
As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and to greet him. -- 1 samuel 13:10
.
But Samuel said, "What have you done?" And Saul said, "Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash, -- 1 samuel 13:11
.
therefore I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked the favor of the LORD.' So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering." -- 1 samuel 13:12
.
Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, for now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. -- 1 samuel 13:13
.
"But now your kingdom shall not endure. The LORD has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you." -- 1 samuel 13:14
