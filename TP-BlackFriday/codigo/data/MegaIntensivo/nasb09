The Lord GOD of hosts, The One who touches the land so that it melts, And all those who dwell in it mourn, And all of it rises up like the Nile And subsides like the Nile of Egypt; -- amos 9:5
.
The One who builds His upper chambers in the heavens And has founded His vaulted dome over the earth, He who calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the face of the earth, The LORD is His name. -- amos 9:6
.
"Are you not as the sons of Ethiopia to Me, O sons of Israel?" declares the LORD. "Have I not brought up Israel from the land of Egypt, And the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir? -- amos 9:7
.
"Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, And I will destroy it from the face of the earth; Nevertheless, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob," Declares the LORD. -- amos 9:8
.
"For behold, I am commanding, And I will shake the house of Israel among all nations As grain is shaken in a sieve, But not a kernel will fall to the ground. -- amos 9:9
.
"All the sinners of My people will die by the sword, Those who say, 'The calamity will not overtake or confront us.' -- amos 9:10
.
"In that day I will raise up the fallen booth of David, And wall up its breaches; I will also raise up its ruins And rebuild it as in the days of old; -- amos 9:11
.
That they may possess the remnant of Edom And all the nations who are called by My name," Declares the LORD who does this. -- amos 9:12
.
"Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "When the plowman will overtake the reaper And the treader of grapes him who sows seed; When the mountains will drip sweet wine And all the hills will be dissolved. -- amos 9:13
.
"Also I will restore the captivity of My people Israel, And they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them; They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine, And make gardens and eat their fruit. -- amos 9:14
.
"I will also plant them on their land, And they will not again be rooted out from their land Which I have given them," Says the LORD your God. -- amos 9:15
.
The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom-- We have heard a report from the LORD, And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying, "Arise and let us go against her for battle"-- -- obadiah 1:1
.
"Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You are greatly despised. -- obadiah 1:2
.
"The arrogance of your heart has deceived you, You who live in the clefts of the rock, In the loftiness of your dwelling place, Who say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to earth?' -- obadiah 1:3
.
"Though you build high like the eagle, Though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down," declares the LORD. -- obadiah 1:4
.
"If thieves came to you, If robbers by night-- O how you will be ruined!-- Would they not steal only until they had enough? If grape gatherers came to you, Would they not leave some gleanings? -- obadiah 1:5
.
"O how Esau will be ransacked, And his hidden treasures searched out! -- obadiah 1:6
.
"All the men allied with you Will send you forth to the border, And the men at peace with you Will deceive you and overpower you. They who eat your bread Will set an ambush for you. (There is no understanding in him.) -- obadiah 1:7
.
"Will I not on that day," declares the LORD, "Destroy wise men from Edom And understanding from the mountain of Esau? -- obadiah 1:8
.
"Then your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman, So that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter. -- obadiah 1:9
.
"Because of violence to your brother Jacob, You will be covered with shame, And you will be cut off forever. -- obadiah 1:10
.
"On the day that you stood aloof, On the day that strangers carried off his wealth, And foreigners entered his gate And cast lots for Jerusalem-- You too were as one of them. -- obadiah 1:11
.
"Do not gloat over your brother's day, The day of his misfortune. And do not rejoice over the sons of Judah In the day of their destruction; Yes, do not boast In the day of their distress. -- obadiah 1:12
.
"Do not enter the gate of My people In the day of their disaster. Yes, you, do not gloat over their calamity In the day of their disaster. And do not loot their wealth In the day of their disaster. -- obadiah 1:13
.
"Do not stand at the fork of the road To cut down their fugitives; And do not imprison their survivors In the day of their distress. -- obadiah 1:14
.
"For the day of the LORD draws near on all the nations. As you have done, it will be done to you. Your dealings will return on your own head. -- obadiah 1:15
.
"Because just as you drank on My holy mountain, All the nations will drink continually. They will drink and swallow And become as if they had never existed. -- obadiah 1:16
.
"But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape, And it will be holy. And the house of Jacob will possess their possessions. -- obadiah 1:17
.
"Then the house of Jacob will be a fire And the house of Joseph a flame; But the house of Esau will be as stubble. And they will set them on fire and consume them, So that there will be no survivor of the house of Esau," For the LORD has spoken. -- obadiah 1:18
.
Then those of the Negev will possess the mountain of Esau, And those of the Shephelah the Philistine plain; Also, possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria, And Benjamin will possess Gilead. -- obadiah 1:19
.
And the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel, Who are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath, And the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad Will possess the cities of the Negev. -- obadiah 1:20
.
The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion To judge the mountain of Esau, And the kingdom will be the LORD'S. -- obadiah 1:21
.
The word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying, -- jonah 1:1
.
"Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and cry against it, for their wickedness has come up before Me." -- jonah 1:2
.
But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. So he went down to Joppa, found a ship which was going to Tarshish, paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. -- jonah 1:3
.
The LORD hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea so that the ship was about to break up. -- jonah 1:4
.
Then the sailors became afraid and every man cried to his god, and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, lain down and fallen sound asleep. -- jonah 1:5
.
So the captain approached him and said, "How is it that you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Perhaps your god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish." -- jonah 1:6
.
Each man said to his mate, "Come, let us cast lots so we may learn on whose account this calamity has struck us." So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah. -- jonah 1:7
.
Then they said to him, "Tell us, now! On whose account has this calamity struck us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?" -- jonah 1:8
.
He said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land." -- jonah 1:9
.
Then the men became extremely frightened and they said to him, "How could you do this?" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. -- jonah 1:10
.
So they said to him, "What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us?"--for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy. -- jonah 1:11
.
He said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will become calm for you, for I know that on account of me this great storm has come upon you." -- jonah 1:12
.
However, the men rowed desperately to return to land but they could not, for the sea was becoming even stormier against them. -- jonah 1:13
.
Then they called on the LORD and said, "We earnestly pray, O LORD, do not let us perish on account of this man's life and do not put innocent blood on us; for You, O LORD, have done as You have pleased." -- jonah 1:14
.
So they picked up Jonah, threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging. -- jonah 1:15
.
Then the men feared the LORD greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows. -- jonah 1:16
.
And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights. -- jonah 1:17
.
Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish, -- jonah 2:1
.
and he said, "I called out of my distress to the LORD, And He answered me. I cried for help from the depth of Sheol; You heard my voice. -- jonah 2:2
.
"For You had cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current engulfed me. All Your breakers and billows passed over me. -- jonah 2:3
.
"So I said, 'I have been expelled from Your sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.' -- jonah 2:4
.
"Water encompassed me to the point of death. The great deep engulfed me, Weeds were wrapped around my head. -- jonah 2:5
.
"I descended to the roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars was around me forever, But You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God. -- jonah 2:6
.
"While I was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, And my prayer came to You, Into Your holy temple. -- jonah 2:7
.
"Those who regard vain idols Forsake their faithfulness, -- jonah 2:8
.
But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD." -- jonah 2:9
.
Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land. -- jonah 2:10
.
Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying, -- jonah 3:1
.
"Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim to it the proclamation which I am going to tell you." -- jonah 3:2
.
So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three days' walk. -- jonah 3:3
.
Then Jonah began to go through the city one day's walk; and he cried out and said, "Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown." -- jonah 3:4
.
Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them. -- jonah 3:5
.
When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes. -- jonah 3:6
.
He issued a proclamation and it said, "In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing. Do not let them eat or drink water. -- jonah 3:7
.
"But both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth; and let men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands. -- jonah 3:8
.
"Who knows, God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger so that we will not perish." -- jonah 3:9
.
When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it. -- jonah 3:10
.
But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry. -- jonah 4:1
.
He prayed to the LORD and said, "Please LORD, was not this what I said while I was still in my own country? Therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity. -- jonah 4:2
.
"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for death is better to me than life." -- jonah 4:3
.
The LORD said, "Do you have good reason to be angry?" -- jonah 4:4
.
Then Jonah went out from the city and sat east of it. There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what would happen in the city. -- jonah 4:5
.
So the LORD God appointed a plant and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head to deliver him from his discomfort. And Jonah was extremely happy about the plant. -- jonah 4:6
.
But God appointed a worm when dawn came the next day and it attacked the plant and it withered. -- jonah 4:7
.
When the sun came up God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head so that he became faint and begged with all his soul to die, saying, "Death is better to me than life." -- jonah 4:8
.
Then God said to Jonah, "Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?" And he said, "I have good reason to be angry, even to death." -- jonah 4:9
.
Then the LORD said, "You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight. -- jonah 4:10
.
"Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals?" -- jonah 4:11
.
The word of the LORD which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. -- micah 1:1
.
Hear, O peoples, all of you; Listen, O earth and all it contains, And let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, The Lord from His holy temple. -- micah 1:2
.
For behold, the LORD is coming forth from His place. He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth. -- micah 1:3
.
The mountains will melt under Him And the valleys will be split, Like wax before the fire, Like water poured down a steep place. -- micah 1:4
.
All this is for the rebellion of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? What is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? -- micah 1:5
.
For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country, Planting places for a vineyard. I will pour her stones down into the valley And will lay bare her foundations. -- micah 1:6
.
All of her idols will be smashed, All of her earnings will be burned with fire And all of her images I will make desolate, For she collected them from a harlot's earnings, And to the earnings of a harlot they will return. -- micah 1:7
.
Because of this I must lament and wail, I must go barefoot and naked; I must make a lament like the jackals And a mourning like the ostriches. -- micah 1:8
.
For her wound is incurable, For it has come to Judah; It has reached the gate of my people, Even to Jerusalem. -- micah 1:9
.
Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all. At Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust. -- micah 1:10
.
Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness. The inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape. The lamentation of Beth-ezel: "He will take from you its support." -- micah 1:11
.
For the inhabitant of Maroth Becomes weak waiting for good, Because a calamity has come down from the LORD To the gate of Jerusalem. -- micah 1:12
.
Harness the chariot to the team of horses, O inhabitant of Lachish-- She was the beginning of sin To the daughter of Zion-- Because in you were found The rebellious acts of Israel. -- micah 1:13
.
Therefore you will give parting gifts On behalf of Moresheth-gath; The houses of Achzib will become a deception To the kings of Israel. -- micah 1:14
.
Moreover, I will bring on you The one who takes possession, O inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will enter Adullam. -- micah 1:15
.
Make yourself bald and cut off your hair, Because of the children of your delight; Extend your baldness like the eagle, For they will go from you into exile. -- micah 1:16
.
Woe to those who scheme iniquity, Who work out evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, For it is in the power of their hands. -- micah 2:1
.
They covet fields and then seize them, And houses, and take them away. They rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance. -- micah 2:2
.
Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time. -- micah 2:3
.
"On that day they will take up against you a taunt And utter a bitter lamentation and say, 'We are completely destroyed! He exchanges the portion of my people; How He removes it from me! To the apostate He apportions our fields.' -- micah 2:4
.
"Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD. -- micah 2:5
.
'Do not speak out,' so they speak out. But if they do not speak out concerning these things, Reproaches will not be turned back. -- micah 2:6
.
"Is it being said, O house of Jacob: 'Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His doings?' Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly? -- micah 2:7
.
"Recently My people have arisen as an enemy-- You strip the robe off the garment From unsuspecting passers-by, From those returned from war. -- micah 2:8
.
"The women of My people you evict, Each one from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever. -- micah 2:9
.
"Arise and go, For this is no place of rest Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction, A painful destruction. -- micah 2:10
.
"If a man walking after wind and falsehood Had told lies and said, 'I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,' He would be spokesman to this people. -- micah 2:11
.
"I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with men. -- micah 2:12
.
"The breaker goes up before them; They break out, pass through the gate and go out by it. So their king goes on before them, And the LORD at their head." -- micah 2:13
.
And I said, "Hear now, heads of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know justice? -- micah 3:1
.
"You who hate good and love evil, Who tear off their skin from them And their flesh from their bones, -- micah 3:2
.
Who eat the flesh of my people, Strip off their skin from them, Break their bones And chop them up as for the pot And as meat in a kettle." -- micah 3:3
.
Then they will cry out to the LORD, But He will not answer them. Instead, He will hide His face from them at that time Because they have practiced evil deeds. -- micah 3:4
.
Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; When they have something to bite with their teeth, They cry, "Peace," But against him who puts nothing in their mouths They declare holy war. -- micah 3:5
.
Therefore it will be night for you--without vision, And darkness for you--without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And the day will become dark over them. -- micah 3:6
.
The seers will be ashamed And the diviners will be embarrassed. Indeed, they will all cover their mouths Because there is no answer from God. -- micah 3:7
.
On the other hand I am filled with power-- With the Spirit of the LORD-- And with justice and courage To make known to Jacob his rebellious act, Even to Israel his sin. -- micah 3:8
.
Now hear this, heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who abhor justice And twist everything that is straight, -- micah 3:9
.
Who build Zion with bloodshed And Jerusalem with violent injustice. -- micah 3:10
.
Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe, Her priests instruct for a price And her prophets divine for money. Yet they lean on the LORD saying, "Is not the LORD in our midst? Calamity will not come upon us." -- micah 3:11
.
Therefore, on account of you Zion will be plowed as a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, And the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest. -- micah 3:12
.
And it will come about in the last days That the mountain of the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains. It will be raised above the hills, And the peoples will stream to it. -- micah 4:1
.
Many nations will come and say, "Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD And to the house of the God of Jacob, That He may teach us about His ways And that we may walk in His paths." For from Zion will go forth the law, Even the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. -- micah 4:2
.
And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they train for war. -- micah 4:3
.
Each of them will sit under his vine And under his fig tree, With no one to make them afraid, For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. -- micah 4:4
.
Though all the peoples walk Each in the name of his god, As for us, we will walk In the name of the LORD our God forever and ever. -- micah 4:5
.
"In that day," declares the LORD, "I will assemble the lame And gather the outcasts, Even those whom I have afflicted. -- micah 4:6
.
"I will make the lame a remnant And the outcasts a strong nation, And the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion From now on and forever. -- micah 4:7
.
"As for you, tower of the flock, Hill of the daughter of Zion, To you it will come-- Even the former dominion will come, The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem. -- micah 4:8
.
"Now, why do you cry out loudly? Is there no king among you, Or has your counselor perished, That agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth? -- micah 4:9
.
"Writhe and labor to give birth, Daughter of Zion, Like a woman in childbirth; For now you will go out of the city, Dwell in the field, And go to Babylon. There you will be rescued; There the LORD will redeem you From the hand of your enemies. -- micah 4:10
.
"And now many nations have been assembled against you Who say, 'Let her be polluted, And let our eyes gloat over Zion.' -- micah 4:11
.
"But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, And they do not understand His purpose; For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor. -- micah 4:12
.
"Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, For your horn I will make iron And your hoofs I will make bronze, That you may pulverize many peoples, That you may devote to the LORD their unjust gain And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth. -- micah 4:13
.
"Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops; They have laid siege against us; With a rod they will smite the judge of Israel on the cheek. -- micah 5:1
.
"But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity." -- micah 5:2
.
Therefore He will give them up until the time When she who is in labor has borne a child. Then the remainder of His brethren Will return to the sons of Israel. -- micah 5:3
.
And He will arise and shepherd His flock In the strength of the LORD, In the majesty of the name of the LORD His God. And they will remain, Because at that time He will be great To the ends of the earth. -- micah 5:4
.
This One will be our peace. When the Assyrian invades our land, When he tramples on our citadels, Then we will raise against him Seven shepherds and eight leaders of men. -- micah 5:5
.
They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, The land of Nimrod at its entrances; And He will deliver us from the Assyrian When he attacks our land And when he tramples our territory. -- micah 5:6
.
Then the remnant of Jacob Will be among many peoples Like dew from the LORD, Like showers on vegetation Which do not wait for man Or delay for the sons of men. -- micah 5:7
.
The remnant of Jacob Will be among the nations, Among many peoples Like a lion among the beasts of the forest, Like a young lion among flocks of sheep, Which, if he passes through, Tramples down and tears, And there is none to rescue. -- micah 5:8
.
Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, And all your enemies will be cut off. -- micah 5:9
.
"It will be in that day," declares the LORD, "That I will cut off your horses from among you And destroy your chariots. -- micah 5:10
.
"I will also cut off the cities of your land And tear down all your fortifications. -- micah 5:11
.
"I will cut off sorceries from your hand, And you will have fortune-tellers no more. -- micah 5:12
.
"I will cut off your carved images And your sacred pillars from among you, So that you will no longer bow down To the work of your hands. -- micah 5:13
.
"I will root out your Asherim from among you And destroy your cities. -- micah 5:14
.
"And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath On the nations which have not obeyed." -- micah 5:15
.
Hear now what the LORD is saying, "Arise, plead your case before the mountains, And let the hills hear your voice. -- micah 6:1
.
"Listen, you mountains, to the indictment of the LORD, And you enduring foundations of the earth, Because the LORD has a case against His people; Even with Israel He will dispute. -- micah 6:2
.
"My people, what have I done to you, And how have I wearied you? Answer Me. -- micah 6:3
.
"Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt And ransomed you from the house of slavery, And I sent before you Moses, Aaron and Miriam. -- micah 6:4
.
"My people, remember now What Balak king of Moab counseled And what Balaam son of Beor answered him, And from Shittim to Gilgal, So that you might know the righteous acts of the LORD." -- micah 6:5
.
With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves? -- micah 6:6
.
Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? -- micah 6:7
.
He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God? -- micah 6:8
.
The voice of the LORD will call to the city-- And it is sound wisdom to fear Your name: "Hear, O tribe. Who has appointed its time? -- micah 6:9
.
"Is there yet a man in the wicked house, Along with treasures of wickedness And a short measure that is cursed? -- micah 6:10
.
"Can I justify wicked scales And a bag of deceptive weights? -- micah 6:11
.
"For the rich men of the city are full of violence, Her residents speak lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. -- micah 6:12
.
"So also I will make you sick, striking you down, Desolating you because of your sins. -- micah 6:13
.
"You will eat, but you will not be satisfied, And your vileness will be in your midst. You will try to remove for safekeeping, But you will not preserve anything, And what you do preserve I will give to the sword. -- micah 6:14
.
"You will sow but you will not reap. You will tread the olive but will not anoint yourself with oil; And the grapes, but you will not drink wine. -- micah 6:15
.
"The statutes of Omri And all the works of the house of Ahab are observed; And in their devices you walk. Therefore I will give you up for destruction And your inhabitants for derision, And you will bear the reproach of My people." -- micah 6:16
.
Woe is me! For I am Like the fruit pickers, like the grape gatherers. There is not a cluster of grapes to eat, Or a first-ripe fig which I crave. -- micah 7:1
.
The godly person has perished from the land, And there is no upright person among men. All of them lie in wait for bloodshed; Each of them hunts the other with a net. -- micah 7:2
.
Concerning evil, both hands do it well. The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe, And a great man speaks the desire of his soul; So they weave it together. -- micah 7:3
.
The best of them is like a briar, The most upright like a thorn hedge. The day when you post your watchmen, Your punishment will come. Then their confusion will occur. -- micah 7:4
.
Do not trust in a neighbor; Do not have confidence in a friend. From her who lies in your bosom Guard your lips. -- micah 7:5
.
For son treats father contemptuously, Daughter rises up against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man's enemies are the men of his own household. -- micah 7:6
.
But as for me, I will watch expectantly for the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. -- micah 7:7
.
Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. Though I fall I will rise; Though I dwell in darkness, the LORD is a light for me. -- micah 7:8
.
I will bear the indignation of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me out to the light, And I will see His righteousness. -- micah 7:9
.
Then my enemy will see, And shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will look on her; At that time she will be trampled down Like mire of the streets. -- micah 7:10
.
It will be a day for building your walls. On that day will your boundary be extended. -- micah 7:11
.
It will be a day when they will come to you From Assyria and the cities of Egypt, From Egypt even to the Euphrates, Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain. -- micah 7:12
.
And the earth will become desolate because of her inhabitants, On account of the fruit of their deeds. -- micah 7:13
.
Shepherd Your people with Your scepter, The flock of Your possession Which dwells by itself in the woodland, In the midst of a fruitful field. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead As in the days of old. -- micah 7:14
.
"As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show you miracles." -- micah 7:15
.
Nations will see and be ashamed Of all their might. They will put their hand on their mouth, Their ears will be deaf. -- micah 7:16
.
They will lick the dust like a serpent, Like reptiles of the earth. They will come trembling out of their fortresses; To the LORD our God they will come in dread And they will be afraid before You. -- micah 7:17
.
Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in unchanging love. -- micah 7:18
.
He will again have compassion on us; He will tread our iniquities under foot. Yes, You will cast all their sins Into the depths of the sea. -- micah 7:19
.
You will give truth to Jacob And unchanging love to Abraham, Which You swore to our forefathers From the days of old. -- micah 7:20
.
The oracle of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. -- nahum 1:1
.
A jealous and avenging God is the LORD; The LORD is avenging and wrathful. The LORD takes vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves wrath for His enemies. -- nahum 1:2
.
The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, And the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. In whirlwind and storm is His way, And clouds are the dust beneath His feet. -- nahum 1:3
.
He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither; The blossoms of Lebanon wither. -- nahum 1:4
.
Mountains quake because of Him And the hills dissolve; Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, The world and all the inhabitants in it. -- nahum 1:5
.
Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the burning of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire And the rocks are broken up by Him. -- nahum 1:6
.
The LORD is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble, And He knows those who take refuge in Him. -- nahum 1:7
.
But with an overflowing flood He will make a complete end of its site, And will pursue His enemies into darkness. -- nahum 1:8
.
Whatever you devise against the LORD, He will make a complete end of it. Distress will not rise up twice. -- nahum 1:9
.
Like tangled thorns, And like those who are drunken with their drink, They are consumed As stubble completely withered. -- nahum 1:10
.
From you has gone forth One who plotted evil against the LORD, A wicked counselor. -- nahum 1:11
.
Thus says the LORD, "Though they are at full strength and likewise many, Even so, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer. -- nahum 1:12
.
"So now, I will break his yoke bar from upon you, And I will tear off your shackles." -- nahum 1:13
.
The LORD has issued a command concerning you: "Your name will no longer be perpetuated. I will cut off idol and image From the house of your gods. I will prepare your grave, For you are contemptible." -- nahum 1:14
.
Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; Pay your vows. For never again will the wicked one pass through you; He is cut off completely. -- nahum 1:15
.
The one who scatters has come up against you. Man the fortress, watch the road; Strengthen your back, summon all your strength. -- nahum 2:1
.
For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob Like the splendor of Israel, Even though devastators have devastated them And destroyed their vine branches. -- nahum 2:2
.
The shields of his mighty men are colored red, The warriors are dressed in scarlet, The chariots are enveloped in flashing steel When he is prepared to march, And the cypress spears are brandished. -- nahum 2:3
.
The chariots race madly in the streets, They rush wildly in the squares, Their appearance is like torches, They dash to and fro like lightning flashes. -- nahum 2:4
.
He remembers his nobles; They stumble in their march, They hurry to her wall, And the mantelet is set up. -- nahum 2:5
.
The gates of the rivers are opened And the palace is dissolved. -- nahum 2:6
.
It is fixed: She is stripped, she is carried away, And her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves, Beating on their breasts. -- nahum 2:7
.
Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days, Now they are fleeing; "Stop, stop," But no one turns back. -- nahum 2:8
.
Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no limit to the treasure-- Wealth from every kind of desirable object. -- nahum 2:9
.
She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste! Hearts are melting and knees knocking! Also anguish is in the whole body And all their faces are grown pale! -- nahum 2:10
.
Where is the den of the lions And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion, lioness and lion's cub prowled, With nothing to disturb them? -- nahum 2:11
.
The lion tore enough for his cubs, Killed enough for his lionesses, And filled his lairs with prey And his dens with torn flesh. -- nahum 2:12
.
"Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts. "I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard." -- nahum 2:13
.
Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies and pillage; Her prey never departs. -- nahum 3:1
.
The noise of the whip, The noise of the rattling of the wheel, Galloping horses And bounding chariots! -- nahum 3:2
.
Horsemen charging, Swords flashing, spears gleaming, Many slain, a mass of corpses, And countless dead bodies-- They stumble over the dead bodies! -- nahum 3:3
.
All because of the many harlotries of the harlot, The charming one, the mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations by her harlotries And families by her sorceries. -- nahum 3:4
.
"Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts; "And I will lift up your skirts over your face, And show to the nations your nakedness And to the kingdoms your disgrace. -- nahum 3:5
.
"I will throw filth on you And make you vile, And set you up as a spectacle. -- nahum 3:6
.
"And it will come about that all who see you Will shrink from you and say, 'Nineveh is devastated! Who will grieve for her?' Where will I seek comforters for you?" -- nahum 3:7
.
Are you better than No-amon, Which was situated by the waters of the Nile, With water surrounding her, Whose rampart was the sea, Whose wall consisted of the sea? -- nahum 3:8
.
Ethiopia was her might, And Egypt too, without limits. Put and Lubim were among her helpers. -- nahum 3:9
.
Yet she became an exile, She went into captivity; Also her small children were dashed to pieces At the head of every street; They cast lots for her honorable men, And all her great men were bound with fetters. -- nahum 3:10
.
You too will become drunk, You will be hidden. You too will search for a refuge from the enemy. -- nahum 3:11
.
All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit-- When shaken, they fall into the eater's mouth. -- nahum 3:12
.
Behold, your people are women in your midst! The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies; Fire consumes your gate bars. -- nahum 3:13
.
Draw for yourself water for the siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Go into the clay and tread the mortar! Take hold of the brick mold! -- nahum 3:14
.
There fire will consume you, The sword will cut you down; It will consume you as the locust does. Multiply yourself like the creeping locust, Multiply yourself like the swarming locust. -- nahum 3:15
.
You have increased your traders more than the stars of heaven-- The creeping locust strips and flies away. -- nahum 3:16
.
Your guardsmen are like the swarming locust. Your marshals are like hordes of grasshoppers Settling in the stone walls on a cold day. The sun rises and they flee, And the place where they are is not known. -- nahum 3:17
.
Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria; Your nobles are lying down. Your people are scattered on the mountains And there is no one to regather them. -- nahum 3:18
.
There is no relief for your breakdown, Your wound is incurable. All who hear about you Will clap their hands over you, For on whom has not your evil passed continually? -- nahum 3:19
.
The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw. -- habakkuk 1:1
.
How long, O LORD, will I call for help, And You will not hear? I cry out to You, "Violence!" Yet You do not save. -- habakkuk 1:2
.
Why do You make me see iniquity, And cause me to look on wickedness? Yes, destruction and violence are before me; Strife exists and contention arises. -- habakkuk 1:3
.
Therefore the law is ignored And justice is never upheld. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore justice comes out perverted. -- habakkuk 1:4
.
"Look among the nations! Observe! Be astonished! Wonder! Because I am doing something in your days-- You would not believe if you were told. -- habakkuk 1:5
.
"For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, That fierce and impetuous people Who march throughout the earth To seize dwelling places which are not theirs. -- habakkuk 1:6
.
"They are dreaded and feared; Their justice and authority originate with themselves. -- habakkuk 1:7
.
"Their horses are swifter than leopards And keener than wolves in the evening. Their horsemen come galloping, Their horsemen come from afar; They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour. -- habakkuk 1:8
.
"All of them come for violence. Their horde of faces moves forward. They collect captives like sand. -- habakkuk 1:9
.
"They mock at kings And rulers are a laughing matter to them. They laugh at every fortress And heap up rubble to capture it. -- habakkuk 1:10
.
"Then they will sweep through like the wind and pass on. But they will be held guilty, They whose strength is their god." -- habakkuk 1:11
.
Are You not from everlasting, O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. You, O LORD, have appointed them to judge; And You, O Rock, have established them to correct. -- habakkuk 1:12
.
Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, And You can not look on wickedness with favor. Why do You look with favor On those who deal treacherously? Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up Those more righteous than they? -- habakkuk 1:13
.
Why have You made men like the fish of the sea, Like creeping things without a ruler over them? -- habakkuk 1:14
.
The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook, Drag them away with their net, And gather them together in their fishing net. Therefore they rejoice and are glad. -- habakkuk 1:15
.
Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net And burn incense to their fishing net; Because through these things their catch is large, And their food is plentiful. -- habakkuk 1:16
.
Will they therefore empty their net And continually slay nations without sparing? -- habakkuk 1:17
.
I will stand on my guard post And station myself on the rampart; And I will keep watch to see what He will speak to me, And how I may reply when I am reproved. -- habakkuk 2:1
.
Then the LORD answered me and said, "Record the vision And inscribe it on tablets, That the one who reads it may run. -- habakkuk 2:2
.
"For the vision is yet for the appointed time; It hastens toward the goal and it will not fail. Though it tarries, wait for it; For it will certainly come, it will not delay. -- habakkuk 2:3
.
"Behold, as for the proud one, His soul is not right within him; But the righteous will live by his faith. -- habakkuk 2:4
.
"Furthermore, wine betrays the haughty man, So that he does not stay at home. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, And he is like death, never satisfied. He also gathers to himself all nations And collects to himself all peoples. -- habakkuk 2:5
.
"Will not all of these take up a taunt-song against him, Even mockery and insinuations against him And say, 'Woe to him who increases what is not his-- For how long-- And makes himself rich with loans?' -- habakkuk 2:6
.
"Will not your creditors rise up suddenly, And those who collect from you awaken? Indeed, you will become plunder for them. -- habakkuk 2:7
.
"Because you have looted many nations, All the remainder of the peoples will loot you-- Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants. -- habakkuk 2:8
.
"Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house To put his nest on high, To be delivered from the hand of calamity! -- habakkuk 2:9
.
"You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off many peoples; So you are sinning against yourself. -- habakkuk 2:10
.
"Surely the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework. -- habakkuk 2:11
.
"Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed And founds a town with violence! -- habakkuk 2:12
.
"Is it not indeed from the LORD of hosts That peoples toil for fire, And nations grow weary for nothing? -- habakkuk 2:13
.
"For the earth will be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, As the waters cover the sea. -- habakkuk 2:14
.
"Woe to you who make your neighbors drink, Who mix in your venom even to make them drunk So as to look on their nakedness! -- habakkuk 2:15
.
"You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor. Now you yourself drink and expose your own nakedness. The cup in the LORD'S right hand will come around to you, And utter disgrace will come upon your glory. -- habakkuk 2:16
.
"For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, And the devastation of its beasts by which you terrified them, Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants. -- habakkuk 2:17
.
"What profit is the idol when its maker has carved it, Or an image, a teacher of falsehood? For its maker trusts in his own handiwork When he fashions speechless idols. -- habakkuk 2:18
.
"Woe to him who says to a piece of wood, 'Awake!' To a mute stone, 'Arise!' And that is your teacher? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, And there is no breath at all inside it. -- habakkuk 2:19
.
"But the LORD is in His holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before Him." -- habakkuk 2:20
.
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth. -- habakkuk 3:1
.
LORD, I have heard the report about You and I fear. O LORD, revive Your work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy. -- habakkuk 3:2
.
God comes from Teman, And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His splendor covers the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise. -- habakkuk 3:3
.
His radiance is like the sunlight; He has rays flashing from His hand, And there is the hiding of His power. -- habakkuk 3:4
.
Before Him goes pestilence, And plague comes after Him. -- habakkuk 3:5
.
He stood and surveyed the earth; He looked and startled the nations. Yes, the perpetual mountains were shattered, The ancient hills collapsed. His ways are everlasting. -- habakkuk 3:6
.
I saw the tents of Cushan under distress, The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling. -- habakkuk 3:7
.
Did the LORD rage against the rivers, Or was Your anger against the rivers, Or was Your wrath against the sea, That You rode on Your horses, On Your chariots of salvation? -- habakkuk 3:8
.
Your bow was made bare, The rods of chastisement were sworn. Selah. You cleaved the earth with rivers. -- habakkuk 3:9
.
The mountains saw You and quaked; The downpour of waters swept by. The deep uttered forth its voice, It lifted high its hands. -- habakkuk 3:10
.
Sun and moon stood in their places; They went away at the light of Your arrows, At the radiance of Your gleaming spear. -- habakkuk 3:11
.
In indignation You marched through the earth; In anger You trampled the nations. -- habakkuk 3:12
.
You went forth for the salvation of Your people, For the salvation of Your anointed. You struck the head of the house of the evil To lay him open from thigh to neck. Selah. -- habakkuk 3:13
.
You pierced with his own spears The head of his throngs. They stormed in to scatter us; Their exultation was like those Who devour the oppressed in secret. -- habakkuk 3:14
.
You trampled on the sea with Your horses, On the surge of many waters. -- habakkuk 3:15
.
I heard and my inward parts trembled, At the sound my lips quivered. Decay enters my bones, And in my place I tremble. Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress, For the people to arise who will invade us. -- habakkuk 3:16
.
Though the fig tree should not blossom And there be no fruit on the vines, Though the yield of the olive should fail And the fields produce no food, Though the flock should be cut off from the fold And there be no cattle in the stalls, -- habakkuk 3:17
.
Yet I will exult in the LORD, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation. -- habakkuk 3:18
.
The Lord GOD is my strength, And He has made my feet like hinds' feet, And makes me walk on my high places. For the choir director, on my stringed instruments. -- habakkuk 3:19
.
The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah: -- zephaniah 1:1
.
"I will completely remove all things From the face of the earth," declares the LORD. -- zephaniah 1:2
.
"I will remove man and beast; I will remove the birds of the sky And the fish of the sea, And the ruins along with the wicked; And I will cut off man from the face of the earth," declares the LORD. -- zephaniah 1:3
.
"So I will stretch out My hand against Judah And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests. -- zephaniah 1:4
.
"And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven, And those who bow down and swear to the LORD and yet swear by Milcom, -- zephaniah 1:5
.
And those who have turned back from following the LORD, And those who have not sought the LORD or inquired of Him." -- zephaniah 1:6
.
Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near, For the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, He has consecrated His guests. -- zephaniah 1:7
.
"Then it will come about on the day of the LORD'S sacrifice That I will punish the princes, the king's sons And all who clothe themselves with foreign garments. -- zephaniah 1:8
.
"And I will punish on that day all who leap on the temple threshold, Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit. -- zephaniah 1:9
.
"On that day," declares the LORD, "There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, A wail from the Second Quarter, And a loud crash from the hills. -- zephaniah 1:10
.
"Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar, For all the people of Canaan will be silenced; All who weigh out silver will be cut off. -- zephaniah 1:11
.
"It will come about at that time That I will search Jerusalem with lamps, And I will punish the men Who are stagnant in spirit, Who say in their hearts, 'The LORD will not do good or evil!' -- zephaniah 1:12
.
"Moreover, their wealth will become plunder And their houses desolate; Yes, they will build houses but not inhabit them, And plant vineyards but not drink their wine." -- zephaniah 1:13
.
Near is the great day of the LORD, Near and coming very quickly; Listen, the day of the LORD! In it the warrior cries out bitterly. -- zephaniah 1:14
.
A day of wrath is that day, A day of trouble and distress, A day of destruction and desolation, A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness, -- zephaniah 1:15
.
A day of trumpet and battle cry Against the fortified cities And the high corner towers. -- zephaniah 1:16
.
I will bring distress on men So that they will walk like the blind, Because they have sinned against the LORD; And their blood will be poured out like dust And their flesh like dung. -- zephaniah 1:17
.
Neither their silver nor their gold Will be able to deliver them On the day of the LORD'S wrath; And all the earth will be devoured In the fire of His jealousy, For He will make a complete end, Indeed a terrifying one, Of all the inhabitants of the earth. -- zephaniah 1:18
.
Gather yourselves together, yes, gather, O nation without shame, -- zephaniah 2:1
.
Before the decree takes effect-- The day passes like the chaff-- Before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, Before the day of the LORD'S anger comes upon you. -- zephaniah 2:2
.
Seek the LORD, All you humble of the earth Who have carried out His ordinances; Seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will be hidden In the day of the LORD'S anger. -- zephaniah 2:3
.
For Gaza will be abandoned And Ashkelon a desolation; Ashdod will be driven out at noon And Ekron will be uprooted. -- zephaniah 2:4
.
Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; And I will destroy you So that there will be no inhabitant. -- zephaniah 2:5
.
So the seacoast will be pastures, With caves for shepherds and folds for flocks. -- zephaniah 2:6
.
And the coast will be For the remnant of the house of Judah, They will pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening; For the LORD their God will care for them And restore their fortune. -- zephaniah 2:7
.
"I have heard the taunting of Moab And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And become arrogant against their territory. -- zephaniah 2:8
.
"Therefore, as I live," declares the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, "Surely Moab will be like Sodom And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah-- A place possessed by nettles and salt pits, And a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them And the remainder of My nation will inherit them." -- zephaniah 2:9
.
This they will have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts. -- zephaniah 2:10
.
The LORD will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his own place. -- zephaniah 2:11
.
"You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword." -- zephaniah 2:12
.
And He will stretch out His hand against the north And destroy Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness. -- zephaniah 2:13
.
Flocks will lie down in her midst, All beasts which range in herds; Both the pelican and the hedgehog Will lodge in the tops of her pillars; Birds will sing in the window, Desolation will be on the threshold; For He has laid bare the cedar work. -- zephaniah 2:14
.
This is the exultant city Which dwells securely, Who says in her heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me." How she has become a desolation, A resting place for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss And wave his hand in contempt. -- zephaniah 2:15
.
Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, The tyrannical city! -- zephaniah 3:1
.
She heeded no voice, She accepted no instruction. She did not trust in the LORD, She did not draw near to her God. -- zephaniah 3:2
.
Her princes within her are roaring lions, Her judges are wolves at evening; They leave nothing for the morning. -- zephaniah 3:3
.
Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law. -- zephaniah 3:4
.
The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the unjust knows no shame. -- zephaniah 3:5
.
"I have cut off nations; Their corner towers are in ruins. I have made their streets desolate, With no one passing by; Their cities are laid waste, Without a man, without an inhabitant. -- zephaniah 3:6
.
"I said, 'Surely you will revere Me, Accept instruction.' So her dwelling will not be cut off According to all that I have appointed concerning her. But they were eager to corrupt all their deeds. -- zephaniah 3:7
.
"Therefore wait for Me," declares the LORD, "For the day when I rise up as a witness. Indeed, My decision is to gather nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All My burning anger; For all the earth will be devoured By the fire of My zeal. -- zephaniah 3:8
.
"For then I will give to the peoples purified lips, That all of them may call on the name of the LORD, To serve Him shoulder to shoulder. -- zephaniah 3:9
.
"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings. -- zephaniah 3:10
.
"In that day you will feel no shame Because of all your deeds By which you have rebelled against Me; For then I will remove from your midst Your proud, exulting ones, And you will never again be haughty On My holy mountain. -- zephaniah 3:11
.
"But I will leave among you A humble and lowly people, And they will take refuge in the name of the LORD. -- zephaniah 3:12
.
"The remnant of Israel will do no wrong And tell no lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they will feed and lie down With no one to make them tremble." -- zephaniah 3:13
.
Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! -- zephaniah 3:14
.
The LORD has taken away His judgments against you, He has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; You will fear disaster no more. -- zephaniah 3:15
.
In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: "Do not be afraid, O Zion; Do not let your hands fall limp. -- zephaniah 3:16
.
"The LORD your God is in your midst, A victorious warrior. He will exult over you with joy, He will be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy. -- zephaniah 3:17
.
"I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts-- They came from you, O Zion; The reproach of exile is a burden on them. -- zephaniah 3:18
.
"Behold, I am going to deal at that time With all your oppressors, I will save the lame And gather the outcast, And I will turn their shame into praise and renown In all the earth. -- zephaniah 3:19
.
"At that time I will bring you in, Even at the time when I gather you together; Indeed, I will give you renown and praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I restore your fortunes before your eyes," Says the LORD. -- zephaniah 3:20
.
In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying, -- haggai 1:1
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'This people says, "The time has not come, even the time for the house of the LORD to be rebuilt."'" -- haggai 1:2
.
Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying, -- haggai 1:3
.
"Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies desolate?" -- haggai 1:4
.
Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways! -- haggai 1:5
.
"You have sown much, but harvest little; you eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing, but no one is warm enough; and he who earns, earns wages to put into a purse with holes." -- haggai 1:6
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways! -- haggai 1:7
.
"Go up to the mountains, bring wood and rebuild the temple, that I may be pleased with it and be glorified," says the LORD. -- haggai 1:8
.
"You look for much, but behold, it comes to little; when you bring it home, I blow it away. Why?" declares the LORD of hosts, "Because of My house which lies desolate, while each of you runs to his own house. -- haggai 1:9
.
"Therefore, because of you the sky has withheld its dew and the earth has withheld its produce. -- haggai 1:10
.
"I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground produces, on men, on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands." -- haggai 1:11
.
Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for the LORD. -- haggai 1:12
.
Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke by the commission of the LORD to the people saying, " 'I am with you,' declares the LORD." -- haggai 1:13
.
So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, -- haggai 1:14
.
on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king. -- haggai 1:15
.
On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet saying, -- haggai 2:1
.
"Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people saying, -- haggai 2:2
.
'Who is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison? -- haggai 2:3
.
'But now take courage, Zerubbabel,' declares the LORD, 'take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all you people of the land take courage,' declares the LORD, 'and work; for I am with you,' declares the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:4
.
'As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt, My Spirit is abiding in your midst; do not fear!' -- haggai 2:5
.
"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Once more in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land. -- haggai 2:6
.
'I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the wealth of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:7
.
'The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,' declares the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:8
.
'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and in this place I will give peace,' declares the LORD of hosts." -- haggai 2:9
.
On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet, saying, -- haggai 2:10
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Ask now the priests for a ruling: -- haggai 2:11
.
'If a man carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and touches bread with this fold, or cooked food, wine, oil, or any other food, will it become holy?'" And the priests answered, "No." -- haggai 2:12
.
Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean from a corpse touches any of these, will the latter become unclean?" And the priests answered, "It will become unclean." -- haggai 2:13
.
Then Haggai said, " 'So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,' declares the LORD, 'and so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean. -- haggai 2:14
.
'But now, do consider from this day onward: before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD, -- haggai 2:15
.
from that time when one came to a grain heap of twenty measures, there would be only ten; and when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there would be only twenty. -- haggai 2:16
.
'I smote you and every work of your hands with blasting wind, mildew and hail; yet you did not come back to Me,' declares the LORD. -- haggai 2:17
.
'Do consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month; from the day when the temple of the LORD was founded, consider: -- haggai 2:18
.
'Is the seed still in the barn? Even including the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree, it has not borne fruit. Yet from this day on I will bless you.'" -- haggai 2:19
.
Then the word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, -- haggai 2:20
.
"Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying, 'I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. -- haggai 2:21
.
'I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, everyone by the sword of another.' -- haggai 2:22
.
'On that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,' declares the LORD, 'and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,'" declares the LORD of hosts. -- haggai 2:23
.
In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, -- zechariah 1:1
.
"The LORD was very angry with your fathers. -- zechariah 1:2
.
"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return to Me," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I may return to you," says the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 1:3
.
"Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds."' But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD. -- zechariah 1:4
.
"Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? -- zechariah 1:5
.
"But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, 'As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.'"'" -- zechariah 1:6
.
On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: -- zechariah 1:7
.
I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. -- zechariah 1:8
.
Then I said, "My lord, what are these?" And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "I will show you what these are." -- zechariah 1:9
.
And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, "These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth." -- zechariah 1:10
.
So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, "We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet." -- zechariah 1:11
.
Then the angel of the LORD said, "O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?" -- zechariah 1:12
.
The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. -- zechariah 1:13
.
So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. -- zechariah 1:14
.
"But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster." -- zechariah 1:15
.
'Therefore thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it," declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem."' -- zechariah 1:16
.
"Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem."'" -- zechariah 1:17
.
Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. -- zechariah 1:18
.
So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?" And he answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem." -- zechariah 1:19
.
Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. -- zechariah 1:20
.
I said, "What are these coming to do?" And he said, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it." -- zechariah 1:21
.
Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. -- zechariah 2:1
.
So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is." -- zechariah 2:2
.
And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, -- zechariah 2:3
.
and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. -- zechariah 2:4
.
'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.'" -- zechariah 2:5
.
"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD. -- zechariah 2:6
.
"Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon." -- zechariah 2:7
.
For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. -- zechariah 2:8
.
"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. -- zechariah 2:9
.
"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD. -- zechariah 2:10
.
"Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. -- zechariah 2:11
.
"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. -- zechariah 2:12
.
"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation." -- zechariah 2:13
.
Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. -- zechariah 3:1
.
The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" -- zechariah 3:2
.
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. -- zechariah 3:3
.
He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes." -- zechariah 3:4
.
Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. -- zechariah 3:5
.
And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, -- zechariah 3:6
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. -- zechariah 3:7
.
'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you--indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. -- zechariah 3:8
.
'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. -- zechariah 3:9
.
'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'" -- zechariah 3:10
.
Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. -- zechariah 4:1
.
He said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; -- zechariah 4:2
.
also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side." -- zechariah 4:3
.
Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, "What are these, my lord?" -- zechariah 4:4
.
So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." -- zechariah 4:5
.
Then he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 4:6
.
'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'" -- zechariah 4:7
.
Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- zechariah 4:8
.
"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. -- zechariah 4:9
.
"For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel--these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth." -- zechariah 4:10
.
Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?" -- zechariah 4:11
.
And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?" -- zechariah 4:12
.
So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." -- zechariah 4:13
.
Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth." -- zechariah 4:14
.
Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. -- zechariah 5:1
.
And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits." -- zechariah 5:2
.
Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. -- zechariah 5:3
.
"I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts, "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones." -- zechariah 5:4
.
Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth." -- zechariah 5:5
.
I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the ephah going forth." Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land -- zechariah 5:6
.
(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah." -- zechariah 5:7
.
Then he said, "This is Wickedness!" And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. -- zechariah 5:8
.
Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. -- zechariah 5:9
.
I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?" -- zechariah 5:10
.
Then he said to me, "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal." -- zechariah 5:11
.
Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. -- zechariah 6:1
.
With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, -- zechariah 6:2
.
with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. -- zechariah 6:3
.
Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?" -- zechariah 6:4
.
The angel replied to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, -- zechariah 6:5
.
with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. -- zechariah 6:6
.
"When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth." And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. -- zechariah 6:7
.
Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north." -- zechariah 6:8
.
The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, -- zechariah 6:9
.
"Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. -- zechariah 6:10
.
"Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. -- zechariah 6:11
.
"Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. -- zechariah 6:12
.
"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."' -- zechariah 6:13
.
"Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. -- zechariah 6:14
.
"Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD." Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God. -- zechariah 6:15
.
In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. -- zechariah 7:1
.
Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, -- zechariah 7:2
.
speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?" -- zechariah 7:3
.
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, -- zechariah 7:4
.
"Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? -- zechariah 7:5
.
'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? -- zechariah 7:6
.
'Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'" -- zechariah 7:7
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, -- zechariah 7:8
.
"Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; -- zechariah 7:9
.
and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.' -- zechariah 7:10
.
"But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. -- zechariah 7:11
.
"They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 7:12
.
"And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts; -- zechariah 7:13
.
"but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate." -- zechariah 7:14
.
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, -- zechariah 8:1
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.' -- zechariah 8:2
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.' -- zechariah 8:3
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. -- zechariah 8:4
.
'And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.' -- zechariah 8:5
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 8:6
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; -- zechariah 8:7
.
and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.' -- zechariah 8:8
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. -- zechariah 8:9
.
'For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. -- zechariah 8:10
.
'But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts. -- zechariah 8:11
.
'For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. -- zechariah 8:12
.
'It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.' -- zechariah 8:13
.
"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented, -- zechariah 8:14
.
so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! -- zechariah 8:15
.
'These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. -- zechariah 8:16
.
'Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,' declares the LORD." -- zechariah 8:17
.
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, -- zechariah 8:18
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.' -- zechariah 8:19
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. -- zechariah 8:20
.
'The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go." -- zechariah 8:21
.
'So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.' -- zechariah 8:22
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'" -- zechariah 8:23
.
The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), -- zechariah 9:1
.
And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. -- zechariah 9:2
.
For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. -- zechariah 9:3
.
Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. -- zechariah 9:4
.
Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. -- zechariah 9:5
.
And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. -- zechariah 9:6
.
And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. -- zechariah 9:7
.
But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. -- zechariah 9:8
.
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. -- zechariah 9:9
.
I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. -- zechariah 9:10
.
As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. -- zechariah 9:11
.
Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. -- zechariah 9:12
.
For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior's sword. -- zechariah 9:13
.
Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. -- zechariah 9:14
.
The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. -- zechariah 9:15
.
And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. -- zechariah 9:16
.
For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. -- zechariah 9:17
.
Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain-- The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. -- zechariah 10:1
.
For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. -- zechariah 10:2
.
"My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. -- zechariah 10:3
.
"From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together. -- zechariah 10:4
.
"They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. -- zechariah 10:5
.
"I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. -- zechariah 10:6
.
"Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. -- zechariah 10:7
.
"I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. -- zechariah 10:8
.
"When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. -- zechariah 10:9
.
"I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. -- zechariah 10:10
.
"And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. -- zechariah 10:11
.
"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD. -- zechariah 10:12
.
Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. -- zechariah 11:1
.
Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. -- zechariah 11:2
.
There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. -- zechariah 11:3
.
Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. -- zechariah 11:4
.
"Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no pity on them. -- zechariah 11:5
.
"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another's power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power." -- zechariah 11:6
.
So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. -- zechariah 11:7
.
Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. -- zechariah 11:8
.
Then I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another's flesh." -- zechariah 11:9
.
I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. -- zechariah 11:10
.
So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. -- zechariah 11:11
.
I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. -- zechariah 11:12
.
Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them." So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. -- zechariah 11:13
.
Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. -- zechariah 11:14
.
The LORD said to me, "Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. -- zechariah 11:15
.
"For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. -- zechariah 11:16
.
"Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind." -- zechariah 11:17
.
The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. T hus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, -- zechariah 12:1
.
"Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. -- zechariah 12:2
.
"It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. -- zechariah 12:3
.
"In that day," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. -- zechariah 12:4
.
"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.' -- zechariah 12:5
.
"In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. -- zechariah 12:6
.
"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. -- zechariah 12:7
.
"In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. -- zechariah 12:8
.
"And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. -- zechariah 12:9
.
"I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. -- zechariah 12:10
.
"In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. -- zechariah 12:11
.
"The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; -- zechariah 12:12
.
the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; -- zechariah 12:13
.
all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. -- zechariah 12:14
.
"In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. -- zechariah 13:1
.
"It will come about in that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. -- zechariah 13:2
.
"And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD'; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. -- zechariah 13:3
.
"Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; -- zechariah 13:4
.
but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.' -- zechariah 13:5
.
"And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will say, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.' -- zechariah 13:6
.
"Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts. "Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. -- zechariah 13:7
.
"It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. -- zechariah 13:8
.
"And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, 'They are My people,' And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'" -- zechariah 13:9
.
Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. -- zechariah 14:1
.
For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. -- zechariah 14:2
.
Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. -- zechariah 14:3
.
In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. -- zechariah 14:4
.
You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! -- zechariah 14:5
.
In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. -- zechariah 14:6
.
For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. -- zechariah 14:7
.
And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. -- zechariah 14:8
.
And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. -- zechariah 14:9
.
All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses. -- zechariah 14:10
.
People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. -- zechariah 14:11
.
Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. -- zechariah 14:12
.
It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. -- zechariah 14:13
.
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. -- zechariah 14:14
.
So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. -- zechariah 14:15
.
Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. -- zechariah 14:16
.
And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. -- zechariah 14:17
.
If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. -- zechariah 14:18
.
This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. -- zechariah 14:19
.
In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD." And the cooking pots in the LORD'S house will be like the bowls before the altar. -- zechariah 14:20
.
Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day. -- zechariah 14:21
.
The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi. -- malachi 1:1
.
"I have loved you," says the LORD. But you say, "How have You loved us?" "Was not Esau Jacob's brother?" declares the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob; -- malachi 1:2
.
but I have hated Esau, and I have made his mountains a desolation and appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness." -- malachi 1:3
.
Though Edom says, "We have been beaten down, but we will return and build up the ruins"; thus says the LORD of hosts, "They may build, but I will tear down; and men will call them the wicked territory, and the people toward whom the LORD is indignant forever." -- malachi 1:4
.
Your eyes will see this and you will say, "The LORD be magnified beyond the border of Israel!" -- malachi 1:5
.
" 'A son honors his father, and a servant his master. Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My respect?' says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, 'How have we despised Your name?' -- malachi 1:6
.
"You are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But you say, 'How have we defiled You?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is to be despised.' -- malachi 1:7
.
"But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why not offer it to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or would he receive you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 1:8
.
"But now will you not entreat God's favor, that He may be gracious to us? With such an offering on your part, will He receive any of you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 1:9
.
"Oh that there were one among you who would shut the gates, that you might not uselessly kindle fire on My altar! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD of hosts, "nor will I accept an offering from you. -- malachi 1:10
.
"For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, My name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense is going to be offered to My name, and a grain offering that is pure; for My name will be great among the nations," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 1:11
.
"But you are profaning it, in that you say, 'The table of the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be despised.' -- malachi 1:12
.
"You also say, 'My, how tiresome it is!' And you disdainfully sniff at it," says the LORD of hosts, "and you bring what was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick; so you bring the offering! Should I receive that from your hand?" says the LORD. -- malachi 1:13
.
"But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord, for I am a great King," says the LORD of hosts, "and My name is feared among the nations." -- malachi 1:14
.
"And now this commandment is for you, O priests. -- malachi 2:1
.
"If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to My name," says the LORD of hosts, "then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings; and indeed, I have cursed them already, because you are not taking it to heart. -- malachi 2:2
.
"Behold, I am going to rebuke your offspring, and I will spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it. -- malachi 2:3
.
"Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that My covenant may continue with Levi," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:4
.
"My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered Me and stood in awe of My name. -- malachi 2:5
.
"True instruction was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found on his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many back from iniquity. -- malachi 2:6
.
"For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:7
.
"But as for you, you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by the instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:8
.
"So I also have made you despised and abased before all the people, just as you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality in the instruction. -- malachi 2:9
.
"Do we not all have one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the covenant of our fathers? -- malachi 2:10
.
"Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD which He loves and has married the daughter of a foreign god. -- malachi 2:11
.
"As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who awakes and answers, or who presents an offering to the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 2:12
.
"This is another thing you do: you cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and with groaning, because He no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. -- malachi 2:13
.
"Yet you say, 'For what reason?' Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. -- malachi 2:14
.
"But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit. And what did that one do while he was seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your youth. -- malachi 2:15
.
"For I hate divorce," says the LORD, the God of Israel, "and him who covers his garment with wrong," says the LORD of hosts. "So take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously." -- malachi 2:16
.
You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied Him?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them," or, "Where is the God of justice?" -- malachi 2:17
.
"Behold, I am going to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:1
.
"But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap. -- malachi 3:2
.
"He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness. -- malachi 3:3
.
"Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years. -- malachi 3:4
.
"Then I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:5
.
"For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed. -- malachi 3:6
.
"From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you," says the LORD of hosts. "But you say, 'How shall we return?' -- malachi 3:7
.
"Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say, 'How have we robbed You?' In tithes and offerings. -- malachi 3:8
.
"You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, the whole nation of you! -- malachi 3:9
.
"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now in this," says the LORD of hosts, "if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows. -- malachi 3:10
.
"Then I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of the ground; nor will your vine in the field cast its grapes," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:11
.
"All the nations will call you blessed, for you shall be a delightful land," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 3:12
.
"Your words have been arrogant against Me," says the LORD. "Yet you say, 'What have we spoken against You?' -- malachi 3:13
.
"You have said, 'It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked in mourning before the LORD of hosts? -- malachi 3:14
.
'So now we call the arrogant blessed; not only are the doers of wickedness built up but they also test God and escape.'" -- malachi 3:15
.
Then those who feared the LORD spoke to one another, and the LORD gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His name. -- malachi 3:16
.
"They will be Mine," says the LORD of hosts, "on the day that I prepare My own possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him." -- malachi 3:17
.
So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him. -- malachi 3:18
.
"For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze," says the LORD of hosts, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch." -- malachi 4:1
.
"But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and skip about like calves from the stall. -- malachi 4:2
.
"You will tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing," says the LORD of hosts. -- malachi 4:3
.
"Remember the law of Moses My servant, even the statutes and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel. -- malachi 4:4
.
"Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD. -- malachi 4:5
.
"He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse." -- malachi 4:6
.
The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham: -- matthew 1:1
.
Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers. -- matthew 1:2
.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram. -- matthew 1:3
.
Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon. -- matthew 1:4
.
Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse. -- matthew 1:5
.
Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah. -- matthew 1:6
.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa. -- matthew 1:7
.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah. -- matthew 1:8
.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah. -- matthew 1:9
.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah. -- matthew 1:10
.
Josiah became the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. -- matthew 1:11
.
After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel. -- matthew 1:12
.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor. -- matthew 1:13
.
Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud. -- matthew 1:14
.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob. -- matthew 1:15
.
Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah. -- matthew 1:16
.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations. -- matthew 1:17
.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. -- matthew 1:18
.
And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. -- matthew 1:19
.
But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. -- matthew 1:20
.
"She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." -- matthew 1:21
.
Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: -- matthew 1:22
.
"BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL," which translated means, "GOD WITH US." -- matthew 1:23
.
And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife, -- matthew 1:24
.
but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus. -- matthew 1:25
.
Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, -- matthew 2:1
.
"Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him." -- matthew 2:2
.
When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. -- matthew 2:3
.
Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. -- matthew 2:4
.
They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet: -- matthew 2:5
.
'AND YOU, BETHLEHEM, LAND OF JUDAH, ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE LEADERS OF JUDAH; FOR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A RULER WHO WILL SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL.'" -- matthew 2:6
.
Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared. -- matthew 2:7
.
And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found Him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him." -- matthew 2:8
.
After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was. -- matthew 2:9
.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. -- matthew 2:10
.
After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. -- matthew 2:11
.
And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way. -- matthew 2:12
.
Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him." -- matthew 2:13
.
So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt. -- matthew 2:14
.
He remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON." -- matthew 2:15
.
Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi. -- matthew 2:16
.
Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: -- matthew 2:17
.
"A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WEEPING AND GREAT MOURNING, RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY WERE NO MORE." -- matthew 2:18
.
But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, -- matthew 2:19
.
"Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child's life are dead." -- matthew 2:20
.
So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel. -- matthew 2:21
.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned by God in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee, -- matthew 2:22
.
and came and lived in a city called Nazareth. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: "He shall be called a Nazarene." -- matthew 2:23
.
Now in those days John the Baptist *came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, -- matthew 3:1
.
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." -- matthew 3:2
.
For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, "THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!'" -- matthew 3:3
.
Now John himself had a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. -- matthew 3:4
.
Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan; -- matthew 3:5
.
and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins. -- matthew 3:6
.
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? -- matthew 3:7
.
"Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance; -- matthew 3:8
.
and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father'; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham. -- matthew 3:9
.
"The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. -- matthew 3:10
.
"As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. -- matthew 3:11
.
"His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." -- matthew 3:12
.
Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John, to be baptized by him. -- matthew 3:13
.
But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?" -- matthew 3:14
.
But Jesus answering said to him, "Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he *permitted Him. -- matthew 3:15
.
After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him, -- matthew 3:16
.
and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased." -- matthew 3:17
.
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. -- matthew 4:1
.
And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He then became hungry. -- matthew 4:2
.
And the tempter came and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread." -- matthew 4:3
.
But He answered and said, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.'" -- matthew 4:4
.
Then the devil *took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, -- matthew 4:5
.
and *said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written, 'HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU'; and 'ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.'" -- matthew 4:6
.
Jesus said to him, "On the other hand, it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'" -- matthew 4:7
.
Again, the devil *took Him to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; -- matthew 4:8
.
and he said to Him, "All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me." -- matthew 4:9
.
Then Jesus *said to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'" -- matthew 4:10
.
Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and began to minister to Him. -- matthew 4:11
.
Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee; -- matthew 4:12
.
and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. -- matthew 4:13
.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: -- matthew 4:14
.
"THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, BEYOND THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES-- -- matthew 4:15
.
"THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING IN DARKNESS SAW A GREAT LIGHT, AND THOSE WHO WERE SITTING IN THE LAND AND SHADOW OF DEATH, UPON THEM A LIGHT DAWNED." -- matthew 4:16
.
From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." -- matthew 4:17
.
Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. -- matthew 4:18
.
And He *said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men." -- matthew 4:19
.
Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. -- matthew 4:20
.
Going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them. -- matthew 4:21
.
Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him. -- matthew 4:22
.
Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people. -- matthew 4:23
.
The news about Him spread throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He healed them. -- matthew 4:24
.
Large crowds followed Him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan. -- matthew 4:25
.
When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him. -- matthew 5:1
.
He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying, -- matthew 5:2
.
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:3
.
"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. -- matthew 5:4
.
"Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. -- matthew 5:5
.
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. -- matthew 5:6
.
"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. -- matthew 5:7
.
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. -- matthew 5:8
.
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. -- matthew 5:9
.
"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:10
.
"Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. -- matthew 5:11
.
"Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. -- matthew 5:12
.
"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. -- matthew 5:13
.
"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; -- matthew 5:14
.
nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. -- matthew 5:15
.
"Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. -- matthew 5:16
.
"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. -- matthew 5:17
.
"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished. -- matthew 5:18
.
"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:19
.
"For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 5:20
.
"You have heard that the ancients were told, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER' and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.' -- matthew 5:21
.
"But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell. -- matthew 5:22
.
"Therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, -- matthew 5:23
.
leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering. -- matthew 5:24
.
"Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. -- matthew 5:25
.
"Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last cent. -- matthew 5:26
.
"You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY'; -- matthew 5:27
.
but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. -- matthew 5:28
.
"If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. -- matthew 5:29
.
"If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell. -- matthew 5:30
.
"It was said, 'WHOEVER SENDS HIS WIFE AWAY, LET HIM GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE'; -- matthew 5:31
.
but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. -- matthew 5:32
.
"Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, 'YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FALSE VOWS, BUT SHALL FULFILL YOUR VOWS TO THE LORD.' -- matthew 5:33
.
"But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, -- matthew 5:34
.
or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING. -- matthew 5:35
.
"Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. -- matthew 5:36
.
"But let your statement be, 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no'; anything beyond these is of evil. -- matthew 5:37
.
"You have heard that it was said, 'AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.' -- matthew 5:38
.
"But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. -- matthew 5:39
.
"If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also. -- matthew 5:40
.
"Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two. -- matthew 5:41
.
"Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. -- matthew 5:42
.
"You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR and hate your enemy.' -- matthew 5:43
.
"But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, -- matthew 5:44
.
so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. -- matthew 5:45
.
"For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? -- matthew 5:46
.
"If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? -- matthew 5:47
.
"Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. -- matthew 5:48
.
"Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. -- matthew 6:1
.
"So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. -- matthew 6:2
.
"But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, -- matthew 6:3
.
so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. -- matthew 6:4
.
"When you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. -- matthew 6:5
.
"But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. -- matthew 6:6
.
"And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words. -- matthew 6:7
.
"So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. -- matthew 6:8
.
"Pray, then, in this way: 'Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. -- matthew 6:9
.
'Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. -- matthew 6:10
.
'Give us this day our daily bread. -- matthew 6:11
.
'And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. -- matthew 6:12
.
'And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.'] -- matthew 6:13
.
"For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. -- matthew 6:14
.
"But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions. -- matthew 6:15
.
"Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. -- matthew 6:16
.
"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face -- matthew 6:17
.
so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. -- matthew 6:18
.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. -- matthew 6:19
.
"But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; -- matthew 6:20
.
for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. -- matthew 6:21
.
"The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light. -- matthew 6:22
.
"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! -- matthew 6:23
.
"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. -- matthew 6:24
.
"For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? -- matthew 6:25
.
"Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they? -- matthew 6:26
.
"And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life? -- matthew 6:27
.
"And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin, -- matthew 6:28
.
yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. -- matthew 6:29
.
"But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith! -- matthew 6:30
.
"Do not worry then, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear for clothing?' -- matthew 6:31
.
"For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. -- matthew 6:32
.
"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. -- matthew 6:33
.
"So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. -- matthew 6:34
.
"Do not judge so that you will not be judged. -- matthew 7:1
.
"For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you. -- matthew 7:2
.
"Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? -- matthew 7:3
.
"Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and behold, the log is in your own eye? -- matthew 7:4
.
"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. -- matthew 7:5
.
"Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. -- matthew 7:6
.
"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. -- matthew 7:7
.
"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. -- matthew 7:8
.
"Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone? -- matthew 7:9
.
"Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? -- matthew 7:10
.
"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him! -- matthew 7:11
.
"In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets. -- matthew 7:12
.
"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. -- matthew 7:13
.
"For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it. -- matthew 7:14
.
"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. -- matthew 7:15
.
"You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? -- matthew 7:16
.
"So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. -- matthew 7:17
.
"A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit. -- matthew 7:18
.
"Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. -- matthew 7:19
.
"So then, you will know them by their fruits. -- matthew 7:20
.
"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. -- matthew 7:21
.
"Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?' -- matthew 7:22
.
"And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.' -- matthew 7:23
.
"Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. -- matthew 7:24
.
"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. -- matthew 7:25
.
"Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. -- matthew 7:26
.
"The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell--and great was its fall." -- matthew 7:27
.
When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at His teaching; -- matthew 7:28
.
for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes. -- matthew 7:29
.
When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him. -- matthew 8:1
.
And a leper came to Him and bowed down before Him, and said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean." -- matthew 8:2
.
Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. -- matthew 8:3
.
And Jesus *said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." -- matthew 8:4
.
And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him, -- matthew 8:5
.
and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, fearfully tormented." -- matthew 8:6
.
Jesus *said to him, "I will come and heal him." -- matthew 8:7
.
But the centurion said, "Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed. -- matthew 8:8
.
"For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it." -- matthew 8:9
.
Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who were following, "Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel. -- matthew 8:10
.
"I say to you that many will come from east and west, and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; -- matthew 8:11
.
but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." -- matthew 8:12
.
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed that very moment. -- matthew 8:13
.
When Jesus came into Peter's home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever. -- matthew 8:14
.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and waited on Him. -- matthew 8:15
.
When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill. -- matthew 8:16
.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: "HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR DISEASES." -- matthew 8:17
.
Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side of the sea. -- matthew 8:18
.
Then a scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go." -- matthew 8:19
.
Jesus *said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head." -- matthew 8:20
.
Another of the disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father." -- matthew 8:21
.
But Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead." -- matthew 8:22
.
When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. -- matthew 8:23
.
And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep. -- matthew 8:24
.
And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, "Save us, Lord; we are perishing!" -- matthew 8:25
.
He *said to them, "Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm. -- matthew 8:26
.
The men were amazed, and said, "What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?" -- matthew 8:27
.
When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way. -- matthew 8:28
.
And they cried out, saying, "What business do we have with each other, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?" -- matthew 8:29
.
Now there was a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them. -- matthew 8:30
.
The demons began to entreat Him, saying, "If You are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of swine." -- matthew 8:31
.
And He said to them, "Go!" And they came out and went into the swine, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters. -- matthew 8:32
.
The herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs. -- matthew 8:33
.
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they implored Him to leave their region. -- matthew 8:34
.
Getting into a boat, Jesus crossed over the sea and came to His own city. -- matthew 9:1
.
And they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven." -- matthew 9:2
.
And some of the scribes said to themselves, "This fellow blasphemes." -- matthew 9:3
.
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? -- matthew 9:4
.
"Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, and walk'? -- matthew 9:5
.
"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--then He *said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your bed and go home." -- matthew 9:6
.
And he got up and went home. -- matthew 9:7
.
But when the crowds saw this, they were awestruck, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. -- matthew 9:8
.
As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the tax collector's booth; and He *said to him, "Follow Me!" And he got up and followed Him. -- matthew 9:9
.
Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples. -- matthew 9:10
.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why is your Teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners?" -- matthew 9:11
.
But when Jesus heard this, He said, "It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. -- matthew 9:12
.
"But go and learn what this means: 'I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT SACRIFICE,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." -- matthew 9:13
.
Then the disciples of John *came to Him, asking, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?" -- matthew 9:14
.
And Jesus said to them, "The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. -- matthew 9:15
.
"But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results. -- matthew 9:16
.
"Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved." -- matthew 9:17
.
While He was saying these things to them, a synagogue official came and bowed down before Him, and said, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live." -- matthew 9:18
.
Jesus got up and began to follow him, and so did His disciples. -- matthew 9:19
.
And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak; -- matthew 9:20
.
for she was saying to herself, "If I only touch His garment, I will get well." -- matthew 9:21
.
But Jesus turning and seeing her said, "Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well." At once the woman was made well. -- matthew 9:22
.
When Jesus came into the official's house, and saw the flute-players and the crowd in noisy disorder, -- matthew 9:23
.
He said, "Leave; for the girl has not died, but is asleep." And they began laughing at Him. -- matthew 9:24
.
But when the crowd had been sent out, He entered and took her by the hand, and the girl got up. -- matthew 9:25
.
This news spread throughout all that land. -- matthew 9:26
.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!" -- matthew 9:27
.
When He entered the house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus *said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They *said to Him, "Yes, Lord." -- matthew 9:28
.
Then He touched their eyes, saying, "It shall be done to you according to your faith." -- matthew 9:29
.
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them: "See that no one knows about this!" -- matthew 9:30
.
But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout all that land. -- matthew 9:31
.
As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was brought to Him. -- matthew 9:32
.
After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed, and were saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel." -- matthew 9:33
.
But the Pharisees were saying, "He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons." -- matthew 9:34
.
Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. -- matthew 9:35
.
Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd. -- matthew 9:36
.
Then He *said to His disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. -- matthew 9:37
.
"Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest." -- matthew 9:38
.
Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. -- matthew 10:1
.
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; -- matthew 10:2
.
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; -- matthew 10:3
.
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him. -- matthew 10:4
.
These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: "Do not go in the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans; -- matthew 10:5
.
but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. -- matthew 10:6
.
"And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' -- matthew 10:7
.
"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give. -- matthew 10:8
.
"Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for your money belts, -- matthew 10:9
.
or a bag for your journey, or even two coats, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is worthy of his support. -- matthew 10:10
.
"And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay at his house until you leave that city. -- matthew 10:11
.
"As you enter the house, give it your greeting. -- matthew 10:12
.
"If the house is worthy, give it your blessing of peace. But if it is not worthy, take back your blessing of peace. -- matthew 10:13
.
"Whoever does not receive you, nor heed your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet. -- matthew 10:14
.
"Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city. -- matthew 10:15
.
"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves. -- matthew 10:16
.
"But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and scourge you in their synagogues; -- matthew 10:17
.
and you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. -- matthew 10:18
.
"But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say. -- matthew 10:19
.
"For it is not you who speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. -- matthew 10:20
.
"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. -- matthew 10:21
.
"You will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved. -- matthew 10:22
.
"But whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next; for truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes. -- matthew 10:23
.
"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. -- matthew 10:24
.
"It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign the members of his household! -- matthew 10:25
.
"Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. -- matthew 10:26
.
"What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops. -- matthew 10:27
.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. -- matthew 10:28
.
"Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. -- matthew 10:29
.
"But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. -- matthew 10:30
.
"So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows. -- matthew 10:31
.
"Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven. -- matthew 10:32
.
"But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven. -- matthew 10:33
.
"Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. -- matthew 10:34
.
"For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER MOTHER-IN-LAW; -- matthew 10:35
.
and A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD. -- matthew 10:36
.
"He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. -- matthew 10:37
.
"And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. -- matthew 10:38
.
"He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it. -- matthew 10:39
.
"He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me. -- matthew 10:40
.
"He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. -- matthew 10:41
.
"And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward." -- matthew 10:42
.
When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. -- matthew 11:1
.
Now when John, while imprisoned, heard of the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples -- matthew 11:2
.
and said to Him, "Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?" -- matthew 11:3
.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see: -- matthew 11:4
.
the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM. -- matthew 11:5
.
"And blessed is he who does not take offense at Me." -- matthew 11:6
.
As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? -- matthew 11:7
.
"But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings' palaces! -- matthew 11:8
.
"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one who is more than a prophet. -- matthew 11:9
.
"This is the one about whom it is written, 'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.' -- matthew 11:10
.
"Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. -- matthew 11:11
.
"From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force. -- matthew 11:12
.
"For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John. -- matthew 11:13
.
"And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is Elijah who was to come. -- matthew 11:14
.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear. -- matthew 11:15
.
"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call out to the other children, -- matthew 11:16
.
and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' -- matthew 11:17
.
"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!' -- matthew 11:18
.
"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." -- matthew 11:19
.
Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent. -- matthew 11:20
.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. -- matthew 11:21
.
"Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. -- matthew 11:22
.
"And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will descend to Hades; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you, it would have remained to this day. -- matthew 11:23
.
"Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you." -- matthew 11:24
.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. -- matthew 11:25
.
"Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight. -- matthew 11:26
.
"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him. -- matthew 11:27
.
"Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. -- matthew 11:28
.
"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS. -- matthew 11:29
.
"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light." -- matthew 11:30
.
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat. -- matthew 12:1
.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath." -- matthew 12:2
.
But He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions, -- matthew 12:3
.
how he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but for the priests alone? -- matthew 12:4
.
"Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent? -- matthew 12:5
.
"But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here. -- matthew 12:6
.
"But if you had known what this means, 'I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT A SACRIFICE,' you would not have condemned the innocent. -- matthew 12:7
.
"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." -- matthew 12:8
.
Departing from there, He went into their synagogue. -- matthew 12:9
.
And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"--so that they might accuse Him. -- matthew 12:10
.
And He said to them, "What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? -- matthew 12:11
.
"How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath." -- matthew 12:12
.
Then He *said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other. -- matthew 12:13
.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, as to how they might destroy Him. -- matthew 12:14
.
But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many followed Him, and He healed them all, -- matthew 12:15
.
and warned them not to tell who He was. -- matthew 12:16
.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: -- matthew 12:17
.
"BEHOLD, MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN; MY BELOVED IN WHOM MY SOUL is WELL-PLEASED; I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM, AND HE SHALL PROCLAIM JUSTICE TO THE GENTILES. -- matthew 12:18
.
"HE WILL NOT QUARREL, NOR CRY OUT; NOR WILL ANYONE HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS. -- matthew 12:19
.
"A BATTERED REED HE WILL NOT BREAK OFF, AND A SMOLDERING WICK HE WILL NOT PUT OUT, UNTIL HE LEADS JUSTICE TO VICTORY. -- matthew 12:20
.
"AND IN HIS NAME THE GENTILES WILL HOPE." -- matthew 12:21
.
Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw. -- matthew 12:22
.
All the crowds were amazed, and were saying, "This man cannot be the Son of David, can he?" -- matthew 12:23
.
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons." -- matthew 12:24
.
And knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and any city or house divided against itself will not stand. -- matthew 12:25
.
"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? -- matthew 12:26
.
"If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges. -- matthew 12:27
.
"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. -- matthew 12:28
.
"Or how can anyone enter the strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house. -- matthew 12:29
.
"He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters. -- matthew 12:30
.
"Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. -- matthew 12:31
.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come. -- matthew 12:32
.
"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. -- matthew 12:33
.
"You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart. -- matthew 12:34
.
"The good man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure what is evil. -- matthew 12:35
.
"But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment. -- matthew 12:36
.
"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." -- matthew 12:37
.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You." -- matthew 12:38
.
But He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; -- matthew 12:39
.
for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. -- matthew 12:40
.
"The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. -- matthew 12:41
.
"The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. -- matthew 12:42
.
"Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it. -- matthew 12:43
.
"Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came'; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order. -- matthew 12:44
.
"Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation." -- matthew 12:45
.
While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him. -- matthew 12:46
.
Someone said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You." -- matthew 12:47
.
But Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said, "Who is My mother and who are My brothers?" -- matthew 12:48
.
And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, "Behold My mother and My brothers! -- matthew 12:49
.
"For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother." -- matthew 12:50
.
That day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea. -- matthew 13:1
.
And large crowds gathered to Him, so He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd was standing on the beach. -- matthew 13:2
.
And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, "Behold, the sower went out to sow; -- matthew 13:3
.
and as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them up. -- matthew 13:4
.
"Others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much soil; and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil. -- matthew 13:5
.
"But when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. -- matthew 13:6
.
"Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them out. -- matthew 13:7
.
"And others fell on the good soil and *yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. -- matthew 13:8
.
"He who has ears, let him hear." -- matthew 13:9
.
And the disciples came and said to Him, "Why do You speak to them in parables?" -- matthew 13:10
.
Jesus answered them, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted. -- matthew 13:11
.
"For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him. -- matthew 13:12
.
"Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see, and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. -- matthew 13:13
.
"In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, 'YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE; -- matthew 13:14
.
FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES, OTHERWISE THEY WOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES, HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM.' -- matthew 13:15
.
"But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear. -- matthew 13:16
.
"For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. -- matthew 13:17
.
"Hear then the parable of the sower. -- matthew 13:18
.
"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road. -- matthew 13:19
.
"The one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; -- matthew 13:20
.
yet he has no firm root in himself, but is only temporary, and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away. -- matthew 13:21
.
"And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns, this is the man who hears the word, and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. -- matthew 13:22
.
"And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil, this is the man who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty." -- matthew 13:23
.
Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. -- matthew 13:24
.
"But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. -- matthew 13:25
.
"But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the tares became evident also. -- matthew 13:26
.
"The slaves of the landowner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?' -- matthew 13:27
.
"And he said to them, 'An enemy has done this!' The slaves *said to him, 'Do you want us, then, to go and gather them up?' -- matthew 13:28
.
"But he *said, 'No; for while you are gathering up the tares, you may uproot the wheat with them. -- matthew 13:29
.
'Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn."'" -- matthew 13:30
.
He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; -- matthew 13:31
.
and this is smaller than all other seeds, but when it is full grown, it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR come and NEST IN ITS BRANCHES." -- matthew 13:32
.
He spoke another parable to them, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened." -- matthew 13:33
.
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable. -- matthew 13:34
.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: "I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN PARABLES; I WILL UTTER THINGS HIDDEN SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD." -- matthew 13:35
.
Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field." -- matthew 13:36
.
And He said, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, -- matthew 13:37
.
and the field is the world; and as for the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one; -- matthew 13:38
.
and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels. -- matthew 13:39
.
"So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age. -- matthew 13:40
.
"The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness, -- matthew 13:41
.
and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 13:42
.
"Then THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. -- matthew 13:43
.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. -- matthew 13:44
.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, -- matthew 13:45
.
and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. -- matthew 13:46
.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind; -- matthew 13:47
.
and when it was filled, they drew it up on the beach; and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers, but the bad they threw away. -- matthew 13:48
.
"So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, -- matthew 13:49
.
and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 13:50
.
"Have you understood all these things?" They *said to Him, "Yes." -- matthew 13:51
.
And Jesus said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old." -- matthew 13:52
.
When Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there. -- matthew 13:53
.
He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? -- matthew 13:54
.
"Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? -- matthew 13:55
.
"And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?" -- matthew 13:56
.
And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household." -- matthew 13:57
.
And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief. -- matthew 13:58
.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus, -- matthew 14:1
.
and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him." -- matthew 14:2
.
For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. -- matthew 14:3
.
For John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." -- matthew 14:4
.
Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a prophet. -- matthew 14:5
.
But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod, -- matthew 14:6
.
so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. -- matthew 14:7
.
Having been prompted by her mother, she *said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." -- matthew 14:8
.
Although he was grieved, the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths, and because of his dinner guests. -- matthew 14:9
.
He sent and had John beheaded in the prison. -- matthew 14:10
.
And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. -- matthew 14:11
.
His disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus. -- matthew 14:12
.
Now when Jesus heard about John, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself; and when the people heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the cities. -- matthew 14:13
.
When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick. -- matthew 14:14
.
When it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said, "This place is desolate and the hour is already late; so send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves." -- matthew 14:15
.
But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat!" -- matthew 14:16
.
They *said to Him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish." -- matthew 14:17
.
And He said, "Bring them here to Me." -- matthew 14:18
.
Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food, and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds, -- matthew 14:19
.
and they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets. -- matthew 14:20
.
There were about five thousand men who ate, besides women and children. -- matthew 14:21
.
Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away. -- matthew 14:22
.
After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone. -- matthew 14:23
.
But the boat was already a long distance from the land, battered by the waves; for the wind was contrary. -- matthew 14:24
.
And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea. -- matthew 14:25
.
When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out in fear. -- matthew 14:26
.
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid." -- matthew 14:27
.
Peter said to Him, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water." -- matthew 14:28
.
And He said, "Come!" And Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus. -- matthew 14:29
.
But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!" -- matthew 14:30
.
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and *said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" -- matthew 14:31
.
When they got into the boat, the wind stopped. -- matthew 14:32
.
And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, "You are certainly God's Son!" -- matthew 14:33
.
When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. -- matthew 14:34
.
And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding district and brought to Him all who were sick; -- matthew 14:35
.
and they implored Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were cured. -- matthew 14:36
.
Then some Pharisees and scribes *came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, -- matthew 15:1
.
"Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread." -- matthew 15:2
.
And He answered and said to them, "Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? -- matthew 15:3
.
"For God said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,' and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.' -- matthew 15:4
.
"But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever I have that would help you has been given to God," -- matthew 15:5
.
he is not to honor his father or his mother.' And by this you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition. -- matthew 15:6
.
"You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you: -- matthew 15:7
.
'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME. -- matthew 15:8
.
'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.'" -- matthew 15:9
.
After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them, "Hear and understand. -- matthew 15:10
.
"It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man." -- matthew 15:11
.
Then the disciples *came and *said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?" -- matthew 15:12
.
But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted. -- matthew 15:13
.
"Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit." -- matthew 15:14
.
Peter said to Him, "Explain the parable to us." -- matthew 15:15
.
Jesus said, "Are you still lacking in understanding also? -- matthew 15:16
.
"Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated? -- matthew 15:17
.
"But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man. -- matthew 15:18
.
"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders. -- matthew 15:19
.
"These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man." -- matthew 15:20
.
Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon. -- matthew 15:21
.
And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed." -- matthew 15:22
.
But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, "Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us." -- matthew 15:23
.
But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." -- matthew 15:24
.
But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" -- matthew 15:25
.
And He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." -- matthew 15:26
.
But she said, "Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." -- matthew 15:27
.
Then Jesus said to her, "O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed at once. -- matthew 15:28
.
Departing from there, Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there. -- matthew 15:29
.
And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them. -- matthew 15:30
.
So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. -- matthew 15:31
.
And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, "I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way." -- matthew 15:32
.
The disciples *said to Him, "Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?" -- matthew 15:33
.
And Jesus *said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few small fish." -- matthew 15:34
.
And He directed the people to sit down on the ground; -- matthew 15:35
.
and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. -- matthew 15:36
.
And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full. -- matthew 15:37
.
And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. -- matthew 15:38
.
And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan. -- matthew 15:39
.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus, they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven. -- matthew 16:1
.
But He replied to them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.' -- matthew 16:2
.
"And in the morning, 'There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of the times? -- matthew 16:3
.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and a sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. -- matthew 16:4
.
And the disciples came to the other side of the sea, but they had forgotten to bring any bread. -- matthew 16:5
.
And Jesus said to them, "Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." -- matthew 16:6
.
They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, "He said that because we did not bring any bread." -- matthew 16:7
.
But Jesus, aware of this, said, "You men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread? -- matthew 16:8
.
"Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets full you picked up? -- matthew 16:9
.
"Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets full you picked up? -- matthew 16:10
.
"How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." -- matthew 16:11
.
Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. -- matthew 16:12
.
Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?" -- matthew 16:13
.
And they said, "Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets." -- matthew 16:14
.
He *said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" -- matthew 16:15
.
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." -- matthew 16:16
.
And Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. -- matthew 16:17
.
"I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. -- matthew 16:18
.
"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven." -- matthew 16:19
.
Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ. -- matthew 16:20
.
From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day. -- matthew 16:21
.
Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen to You." -- matthew 16:22
.
But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's." -- matthew 16:23
.
Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me. -- matthew 16:24
.
"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. -- matthew 16:25
.
"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? -- matthew 16:26
.
"For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and WILL THEN REPAY EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS. -- matthew 16:27
.
"Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." -- matthew 16:28
.
Six days later Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and *led them up on a high mountain by themselves. -- matthew 17:1
.
And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light. -- matthew 17:2
.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. -- matthew 17:3
.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah." -- matthew 17:4
.
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, "This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!" -- matthew 17:5
.
When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground and were terrified. -- matthew 17:6
.
And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, "Get up, and do not be afraid." -- matthew 17:7
.
And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone. -- matthew 17:8
.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead." -- matthew 17:9
.
And His disciples asked Him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" -- matthew 17:10
.
And He answered and said, "Elijah is coming and will restore all things; -- matthew 17:11
.
but I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands." -- matthew 17:12
.
Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist. -- matthew 17:13
.
When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, falling on his knees before Him and saying, -- matthew 17:14
.
"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and is very ill; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. -- matthew 17:15
.
"I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him." -- matthew 17:16
.
And Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me." -- matthew 17:17
.
And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured at once. -- matthew 17:18
.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not drive it out?" -- matthew 17:19
.
And He *said to them, "Because of the littleness of your faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you. -- matthew 17:20
.
["But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."] -- matthew 17:21
.
And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men; -- matthew 17:22
.
and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day." And they were deeply grieved. -- matthew 17:23
.
When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?" -- matthew 17:24
.
He *said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax, from their sons or from strangers?" -- matthew 17:25
.
When Peter said, "From strangers," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are exempt. -- matthew 17:26
.
"However, so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for you and Me." -- matthew 17:27
.
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" -- matthew 18:1
.
And He called a child to Himself and set him before them, -- matthew 18:2
.
and said, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 18:3
.
"Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 18:4
.
"And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me; -- matthew 18:5
.
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. -- matthew 18:6
.
"Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes! -- matthew 18:7
.
"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. -- matthew 18:8
.
"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell. -- matthew 18:9
.
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven. -- matthew 18:10
.
["For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.] -- matthew 18:11
.
"What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying? -- matthew 18:12
.
"If it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. -- matthew 18:13
.
"So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish. -- matthew 18:14
.
"If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother. -- matthew 18:15
.
"But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY FACT MAY BE CONFIRMED. -- matthew 18:16
.
"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. -- matthew 18:17
.
"Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven. -- matthew 18:18
.
"Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven. -- matthew 18:19
.
"For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst." -- matthew 18:20
.
Then Peter came and said to Him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" -- matthew 18:21
.
Jesus *said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. -- matthew 18:22
.
"For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. -- matthew 18:23
.
"When he had begun to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. -- matthew 18:24
.
"But since he did not have the means to repay, his lord commanded him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made. -- matthew 18:25
.
"So the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.' -- matthew 18:26
.
"And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt. -- matthew 18:27
.
"But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay back what you owe.' -- matthew 18:28
.
"So his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you.' -- matthew 18:29
.
"But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed. -- matthew 18:30
.
"So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened. -- matthew 18:31
.
"Then summoning him, his lord *said to him, 'You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. -- matthew 18:32
.
'Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in the same way that I had mercy on you?' -- matthew 18:33
.
"And his lord, moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him. -- matthew 18:34
.
"My heavenly Father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart." -- matthew 18:35
.
When Jesus had finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan; -- matthew 19:1
.
and large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there. -- matthew 19:2
.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?" -- matthew 19:3
.
And He answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, -- matthew 19:4
.
and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'? -- matthew 19:5
.
"So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." -- matthew 19:6
.
They *said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY?" -- matthew 19:7
.
He *said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way. -- matthew 19:8
.
"And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery." -- matthew 19:9
.
The disciples *said to Him, "If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry." -- matthew 19:10
.
But He said to them, "Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given. -- matthew 19:11
.
"For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it." -- matthew 19:12
.
Then some children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. -- matthew 19:13
.
But Jesus said, "Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." -- matthew 19:14
.
After laying His hands on them, He departed from there. -- matthew 19:15
.
And someone came to Him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?" -- matthew 19:16
.
And He said to him, "Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments." -- matthew 19:17
.
Then he *said to Him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER; YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY; YOU SHALL NOT STEAL; YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS; -- matthew 19:18
.
HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER; and YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF." -- matthew 19:19
.
The young man *said to Him, "All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?" -- matthew 19:20
.
Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me." -- matthew 19:21
.
But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property. -- matthew 19:22
.
And Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. -- matthew 19:23
.
"Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." -- matthew 19:24
.
When the disciples heard this, they were very astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?" -- matthew 19:25
.
And looking at them Jesus said to them, "With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." -- matthew 19:26
.
Then Peter said to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?" -- matthew 19:27
.
And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. -- matthew 19:28
.
"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name's sake, will receive many times as much, and will inherit eternal life. -- matthew 19:29
.
"But many who are first will be last; and the last, first. -- matthew 19:30
.
"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. -- matthew 20:1
.
"When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. -- matthew 20:2
.
"And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place; -- matthew 20:3
.
and to those he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' And so they went. -- matthew 20:4
.
"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing. -- matthew 20:5
.
"And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he *said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day long?' -- matthew 20:6
.
"They *said to him, 'Because no one hired us.' He *said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' -- matthew 20:7
.
"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first.' -- matthew 20:8
.
"When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius. -- matthew 20:9
.
"When those hired first came, they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. -- matthew 20:10
.
"When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner, -- matthew 20:11
.
saying, 'These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.' -- matthew 20:12
.
"But he answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? -- matthew 20:13
.
'Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you. -- matthew 20:14
.
'Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?' -- matthew 20:15
.
"So the last shall be first, and the first last." -- matthew 20:16
.
As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them, -- matthew 20:17
.
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, -- matthew 20:18
.
and will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised up." -- matthew 20:19
.
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him. -- matthew 20:20
.
And He said to her, "What do you wish?" She *said to Him, "Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left." -- matthew 20:21
.
But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They *said to Him, "We are able." -- matthew 20:22
.
He *said to them, "My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father." -- matthew 20:23
.
And hearing this, the ten became indignant with the two brothers. -- matthew 20:24
.
But Jesus called them to Himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. -- matthew 20:25
.
"It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, -- matthew 20:26
.
and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave; -- matthew 20:27
.
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many." -- matthew 20:28
.
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. -- matthew 20:29
.
And two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" -- matthew 20:30
.
The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!" -- matthew 20:31
.
And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" -- matthew 20:32
.
They *said to Him, "Lord, we want our eyes to be opened." -- matthew 20:33
.
Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him. -- matthew 20:34
.
When they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, -- matthew 21:1
.
saying to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me. -- matthew 21:2
.
"If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and immediately he will send them." -- matthew 21:3
.
This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: -- matthew 21:4
.
"SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'" -- matthew 21:5
.
The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them, -- matthew 21:6
.
and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their coats on them; and He sat on the coats. -- matthew 21:7
.
Most of the crowd spread their coats in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road. -- matthew 21:8
.
The crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!" -- matthew 21:9
.
When He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?" -- matthew 21:10
.
And the crowds were saying, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee." -- matthew 21:11
.
And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves. -- matthew 21:12
.
And He *said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER'; but you are making it a ROBBERS' DEN." -- matthew 21:13
.
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them. -- matthew 21:14
.
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they became indignant -- matthew 21:15
.
and said to Him, "Do You hear what these children are saying?" And Jesus *said to them, "Yes; have you never read, 'OUT OF THE MOUTH OF INFANTS AND NURSING BABIES YOU HAVE PREPARED PRAISE FOR YOURSELF'?" -- matthew 21:16
.
And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. -- matthew 21:17
.
Now in the morning, when He was returning to the city, He became hungry. -- matthew 21:18
.
Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only; and He *said to it, "No longer shall there ever be any fruit from you." And at once the fig tree withered. -- matthew 21:19
.
Seeing this, the disciples were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither all at once?" -- matthew 21:20
.
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen. -- matthew 21:21
.
"And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." -- matthew 21:22
.
When He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?" -- matthew 21:23
.
Jesus said to them, "I will also ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. -- matthew 21:24
.
"The baptism of John was from what source, from heaven or from men?" And they began reasoning among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Then why did you not believe him?' -- matthew 21:25
.
"But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the people; for they all regard John as a prophet." -- matthew 21:26
.
And answering Jesus, they said, "We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. -- matthew 21:27
.
"But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.' -- matthew 21:28
.
"And he answered, 'I will not'; but afterward he regretted it and went. -- matthew 21:29
.
"The man came to the second and said the same thing; and he answered, 'I will, sir'; but he did not go. -- matthew 21:30
.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They *said, "The first." Jesus *said to them, "Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you. -- matthew 21:31
.
"For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him. -- matthew 21:32
.
"Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT AND DUG A WINE PRESS IN IT, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey. -- matthew 21:33
.
"When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce. -- matthew 21:34
.
"The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third. -- matthew 21:35
.
"Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them. -- matthew 21:36
.
"But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' -- matthew 21:37
.
"But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.' -- matthew 21:38
.
"They took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. -- matthew 21:39
.
"Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?" -- matthew 21:40
.
They *said to Him, "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons." -- matthew 21:41
.
Jesus *said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone; THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'? -- matthew 21:42
.
"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people, producing the fruit of it. -- matthew 21:43
.
"And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust." -- matthew 21:44
.
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them. -- matthew 21:45
.
When they sought to seize Him, they feared the people, because they considered Him to be a prophet. -- matthew 21:46
.
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, -- matthew 22:1
.
"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son. -- matthew 22:2
.
"And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come. -- matthew 22:3
.
"Again he sent out other slaves saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast."' -- matthew 22:4
.
"But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business, -- matthew 22:5
.
and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them. -- matthew 22:6
.
"But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire. -- matthew 22:7
.
"Then he *said to his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. -- matthew 22:8
.
'Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.' -- matthew 22:9
.
"Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests. -- matthew 22:10
.
"But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes, -- matthew 22:11
.
and he *said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?' And the man was speechless. -- matthew 22:12
.
"Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' -- matthew 22:13
.
"For many are called, but few are chosen." -- matthew 22:14
.
Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said. -- matthew 22:15
.
And they *sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any. -- matthew 22:16
.
"Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?" -- matthew 22:17
.
But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, "Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites? -- matthew 22:18
.
"Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax." And they brought Him a denarius. -- matthew 22:19
.
And He *said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" -- matthew 22:20
.
They *said to Him, "Caesar's." Then He *said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's." -- matthew 22:21
.
And hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away. -- matthew 22:22
.
On that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Jesus and questioned Him, -- matthew 22:23
.
asking, "Teacher, Moses said, 'IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER.' -- matthew 22:24
.
"Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother; -- matthew 22:25
.
so also the second, and the third, down to the seventh. -- matthew 22:26
.
"Last of all, the woman died. -- matthew 22:27
.
"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her." -- matthew 22:28
.
But Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God. -- matthew 22:29
.
"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. -- matthew 22:30
.
"But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God: -- matthew 22:31
.
'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living." -- matthew 22:32
.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching. -- matthew 22:33
.
But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together. -- matthew 22:34
.
One of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, -- matthew 22:35
.
"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" -- matthew 22:36
.
And He said to him, " 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.' -- matthew 22:37
.
"This is the great and foremost commandment. -- matthew 22:38
.
"The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.' -- matthew 22:39
.
"On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets." -- matthew 22:40
.
Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question: -- matthew 22:41
.
"What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?" They *said to Him, "The son of David." -- matthew 22:42
.
He *said to them, "Then how does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying, -- matthew 22:43
.
'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET"'? -- matthew 22:44
.
"If David then calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his son?" -- matthew 22:45
.
No one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question. -- matthew 22:46
.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples, -- matthew 23:1
.
saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses; -- matthew 23:2
.
therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them. -- matthew 23:3
.
"They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger. -- matthew 23:4
.
"But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments. -- matthew 23:5
.
"They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues, -- matthew 23:6
.
and respectful greetings in the market places, and being called Rabbi by men. -- matthew 23:7
.
"But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. -- matthew 23:8
.
"Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. -- matthew 23:9
.
"Do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, that is, Christ. -- matthew 23:10
.
"But the greatest among you shall be your servant. -- matthew 23:11
.
"Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. -- matthew 23:12
.
"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. -- matthew 23:13
.
["Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.] -- matthew 23:14
.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. -- matthew 23:15
.
"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.' -- matthew 23:16
.
"You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold? -- matthew 23:17
.
"And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.' -- matthew 23:18
.
"You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering? -- matthew 23:19
.
"Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it. -- matthew 23:20
.
"And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it. -- matthew 23:21
.
"And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it. -- matthew 23:22
.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others. -- matthew 23:23
.
"You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel! -- matthew 23:24
.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence. -- matthew 23:25
.
"You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also. -- matthew 23:26
.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. -- matthew 23:27
.
"So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. -- matthew 23:28
.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, -- matthew 23:29
.
and say, 'If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' -- matthew 23:30
.
"So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. -- matthew 23:31
.
"Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers. -- matthew 23:32
.
"You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell? -- matthew 23:33
.
"Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city, -- matthew 23:34
.
so that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. -- matthew 23:35
.
"Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. -- matthew 23:36
.
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling. -- matthew 23:37
.
"Behold, your house is being left to you desolate! -- matthew 23:38
.
"For I say to you, from now on you will not see Me until you say, 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!'" -- matthew 23:39
.
Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him. -- matthew 24:1
.
And He said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down." -- matthew 24:2
.
As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?" -- matthew 24:3
.
And Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one misleads you. -- matthew 24:4
.
"For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many. -- matthew 24:5
.
"You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end. -- matthew 24:6
.
"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes. -- matthew 24:7
.
"But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs. -- matthew 24:8
.
"Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. -- matthew 24:9
.
"At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. -- matthew 24:10
.
"Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. -- matthew 24:11
.
"Because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold. -- matthew 24:12
.
"But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. -- matthew 24:13
.
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. -- matthew 24:14
.
"Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), -- matthew 24:15
.
then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. -- matthew 24:16
.
"Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house. -- matthew 24:17
.
"Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. -- matthew 24:18
.
"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! -- matthew 24:19
.
"But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath. -- matthew 24:20
.
"For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will. -- matthew 24:21
.
"Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. -- matthew 24:22
.
"Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or 'There He is,' do not believe him. -- matthew 24:23
.
"For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect. -- matthew 24:24
.
"Behold, I have told you in advance. -- matthew 24:25
.
"So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out, or, 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe them. -- matthew 24:26
.
"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. -- matthew 24:27
.
"Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather. -- matthew 24:28
.
"But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. -- matthew 24:29
.
"And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory. -- matthew 24:30
.
"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other. -- matthew 24:31
.
"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near; -- matthew 24:32
.
so, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, right at the door. -- matthew 24:33
.
"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. -- matthew 24:34
.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. -- matthew 24:35
.
"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. -- matthew 24:36
.
"For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. -- matthew 24:37
.
"For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, -- matthew 24:38
.
and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be. -- matthew 24:39
.
"Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. -- matthew 24:40
.
"Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left. -- matthew 24:41
.
"Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming. -- matthew 24:42
.
"But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. -- matthew 24:43
.
"For this reason you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will. -- matthew 24:44
.
"Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time? -- matthew 24:45
.
"Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes. -- matthew 24:46
.
"Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. -- matthew 24:47
.
"But if that evil slave says in his heart, 'My master is not coming for a long time,' -- matthew 24:48
.
and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards; -- matthew 24:49
.
the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, -- matthew 24:50
.
and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 24:51
.
"Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. -- matthew 25:1
.
"Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent. -- matthew 25:2
.
"For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, -- matthew 25:3
.
but the prudent took oil in flasks along with their lamps. -- matthew 25:4
.
"Now while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to sleep. -- matthew 25:5
.
"But at midnight there was a shout, 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' -- matthew 25:6
.
"Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. -- matthew 25:7
.
"The foolish said to the prudent, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' -- matthew 25:8
.
"But the prudent answered, 'No, there will not be enough for us and you too; go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.' -- matthew 25:9
.
"And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut. -- matthew 25:10
.
"Later the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, lord, open up for us.' -- matthew 25:11
.
"But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.' -- matthew 25:12
.
"Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour. -- matthew 25:13
.
"For it is just like a man about to go on a journey, who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them. -- matthew 25:14
.
"To one he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey. -- matthew 25:15
.
"Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents. -- matthew 25:16
.
"In the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more. -- matthew 25:17
.
"But he who received the one talent went away, and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. -- matthew 25:18
.
"Now after a long time the master of those slaves *came and *settled accounts with them. -- matthew 25:19
.
"The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have gained five more talents.' -- matthew 25:20
.
"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.' -- matthew 25:21
.
"Also the one who had received the two talents came up and said, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more talents.' -- matthew 25:22
.
"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.' -- matthew 25:23
.
"And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed. -- matthew 25:24
.
'And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.' -- matthew 25:25
.
"But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed. -- matthew 25:26
.
'Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest. -- matthew 25:27
.
'Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.' -- matthew 25:28
.
"For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. -- matthew 25:29
.
"Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. -- matthew 25:30
.
"But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. -- matthew 25:31
.
"All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; -- matthew 25:32
.
and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left. -- matthew 25:33
.
"Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. -- matthew 25:34
.
'For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; -- matthew 25:35
.
naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.' -- matthew 25:36
.
"Then the righteous will answer Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? -- matthew 25:37
.
'And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? -- matthew 25:38
.
'When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?' -- matthew 25:39
.
"The King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.' -- matthew 25:40
.
"Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels; -- matthew 25:41
.
for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; -- matthew 25:42
.
I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.' -- matthew 25:43
.
"Then they themselves also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?' -- matthew 25:44
.
"Then He will answer them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.' -- matthew 25:45
.
"These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." -- matthew 25:46
.
When Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples, -- matthew 26:1
.
"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man is to be handed over for crucifixion." -- matthew 26:2
.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas; -- matthew 26:3
.
and they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth and kill Him. -- matthew 26:4
.
But they were saying, "Not during the festival, otherwise a riot might occur among the people." -- matthew 26:5
.
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper, -- matthew 26:6
.
a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at the table. -- matthew 26:7
.
But the disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said, "Why this waste? -- matthew 26:8
.
"For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor." -- matthew 26:9
.
But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you bother the woman? For she has done a good deed to Me. -- matthew 26:10
.
"For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me. -- matthew 26:11
.
"For when she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial. -- matthew 26:12
.
"Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her." -- matthew 26:13
.
Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests -- matthew 26:14
.
and said, "What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?" And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him. -- matthew 26:15
.
From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus. -- matthew 26:16
.
Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?" -- matthew 26:17
.
And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I am to keep the Passover at your house with My disciples."'" -- matthew 26:18
.
The disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover. -- matthew 26:19
.
Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. -- matthew 26:20
.
As they were eating, He said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me." -- matthew 26:21
.
Being deeply grieved, they each one began to say to Him, "Surely not I, Lord?" -- matthew 26:22
.
And He answered, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me. -- matthew 26:23
.
"The Son of Man is to go, just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born." -- matthew 26:24
.
And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, "Surely it is not I, Rabbi?" Jesus *said to him, "You have said it yourself." -- matthew 26:25
.
While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body." -- matthew 26:26
.
And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you; -- matthew 26:27
.
for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. -- matthew 26:28
.
"But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." -- matthew 26:29
.
After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. -- matthew 26:30
.
Then Jesus *said to them, "You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK SHALL BE SCATTERED.' -- matthew 26:31
.
"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee." -- matthew 26:32
.
But Peter said to Him, "Even though all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away." -- matthew 26:33
.
Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you that this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." -- matthew 26:34
.
Peter *said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You." All the disciples said the same thing too. -- matthew 26:35
.
Then Jesus *came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and *said to His disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." -- matthew 26:36
.
And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed. -- matthew 26:37
.
Then He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me." -- matthew 26:38
.
And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will." -- matthew 26:39
.
And He *came to the disciples and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, "So, you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour? -- matthew 26:40
.
"Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." -- matthew 26:41
.
He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done." -- matthew 26:42
.
Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. -- matthew 26:43
.
And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more. -- matthew 26:44
.
Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. -- matthew 26:45
.
"Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!" -- matthew 26:46
.
While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, who came from the chief priests and elders of the people. -- matthew 26:47
.
Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him." -- matthew 26:48
.
Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed Him. -- matthew 26:49
.
And Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. -- matthew 26:50
.
And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. -- matthew 26:51
.
Then Jesus *said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword. -- matthew 26:52
.
"Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels? -- matthew 26:53
.
"How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way?" -- matthew 26:54
.
At that time Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me. -- matthew 26:55
.
"But all this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures of the prophets." Then all the disciples left Him and fled. -- matthew 26:56
.
Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. -- matthew 26:57
.
But Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and entered in, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome. -- matthew 26:58
.
Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death. -- matthew 26:59
.
They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward, -- matthew 26:60
.
and said, "This man stated, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.'" -- matthew 26:61
.
The high priest stood up and said to Him, "Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?" -- matthew 26:62
.
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God." -- matthew 26:63
.
Jesus *said to him, "You have said it yourself; nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you will see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN." -- matthew 26:64
.
Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy; -- matthew 26:65
.
what do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death!" -- matthew 26:66
.
Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others slapped Him, -- matthew 26:67
.
and said, "Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit You?" -- matthew 26:68
.
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilean." -- matthew 26:69
.
But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about." -- matthew 26:70
.
When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant-girl saw him and *said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth." -- matthew 26:71
.
And again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man." -- matthew 26:72
.
A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are one of them; for even the way you talk gives you away." -- matthew 26:73
.
Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed. -- matthew 26:74
.
And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly. -- matthew 26:75
.
Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death; -- matthew 27:1
.
and they bound Him, and led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor. -- matthew 27:2
.
Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, -- matthew 27:3
.
saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to that yourself!" -- matthew 27:4
.
And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself. -- matthew 27:5
.
The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood." -- matthew 27:6
.
And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter's Field as a burial place for strangers. -- matthew 27:7
.
For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. -- matthew 27:8
.
Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel; -- matthew 27:9
.
AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE POTTER'S FIELD, AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME." -- matthew 27:10
.
Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said to him, "It is as you say." -- matthew 27:11
.
And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer. -- matthew 27:12
.
Then Pilate *said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?" -- matthew 27:13
.
And He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge, so the governor was quite amazed. -- matthew 27:14
.
Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people any one prisoner whom they wanted. -- matthew 27:15
.
At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. -- matthew 27:16
.
So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" -- matthew 27:17
.
For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over. -- matthew 27:18
.
While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him." -- matthew 27:19
.
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death. -- matthew 27:20
.
But the governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas." -- matthew 27:21
.
Pilate *said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all *said, "Crucify Him!" -- matthew 27:22
.
And he said, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, "Crucify Him!" -- matthew 27:23
.
When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this Man's blood; see to that yourselves." -- matthew 27:24
.
And all the people said, "His blood shall be on us and on our children!" -- matthew 27:25
.
Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified. -- matthew 27:26
.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around Him. -- matthew 27:27
.
They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. -- matthew 27:28
.
And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" -- matthew 27:29
.
They spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head. -- matthew 27:30
.
After they had mocked Him, they took the scarlet robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him. -- matthew 27:31
.
As they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross. -- matthew 27:32
.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull, -- matthew 27:33
.
they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; and after tasting it, He was unwilling to drink. -- matthew 27:34
.
And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots. -- matthew 27:35
.
And sitting down, they began to keep watch over Him there. -- matthew 27:36
.
And above His head they put up the charge against Him which read, "THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS." -- matthew 27:37
.
At that time two robbers *were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left. -- matthew 27:38
.
And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads -- matthew 27:39
.
and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross." -- matthew 27:40
.
In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking Him and saying, -- matthew 27:41
.
"He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him. -- matthew 27:42
.
"HE TRUSTS IN GOD; LET GOD RESCUE Him now, IF HE DELIGHTS IN HIM; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'" -- matthew 27:43
.
The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words. -- matthew 27:44
.
Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour. -- matthew 27:45
.
About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" that is, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?" -- matthew 27:46
.
And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, began saying, "This man is calling for Elijah." -- matthew 27:47
.
Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink. -- matthew 27:48
.
But the rest of them said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him." -- matthew 27:49
.
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit. -- matthew 27:50
.
And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split. -- matthew 27:51
.
The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; -- matthew 27:52
.
and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many. -- matthew 27:53
.
Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!" -- matthew 27:54
.
Many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to Him. -- matthew 27:55
.
Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. -- matthew 27:56
.
When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. -- matthew 27:57
.
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. -- matthew 27:58
.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, -- matthew 27:59
.
and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. -- matthew 27:60
.
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave. -- matthew 27:61
.
Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate, -- matthew 27:62
.
and said, "Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I am to rise again.' -- matthew 27:63
.
"Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first." -- matthew 27:64
.
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how." -- matthew 27:65
.
And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone. -- matthew 27:66
.
Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave. -- matthew 28:1
.
And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. -- matthew 28:2
.
And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. -- matthew 28:3
.
The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men. -- matthew 28:4
.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified. -- matthew 28:5
.
"He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying. -- matthew 28:6
.
"Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you." -- matthew 28:7
.
And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples. -- matthew 28:8
.
And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him. -- matthew 28:9
.
Then Jesus *said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me." -- matthew 28:10
.
Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. -- matthew 28:11
.
And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, -- matthew 28:12
.
and said, "You are to say, 'His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.' -- matthew 28:13
.
"And if this should come to the governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble." -- matthew 28:14
.
And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day. -- matthew 28:15
.
But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated. -- matthew 28:16
.
When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful. -- matthew 28:17
.
And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. -- matthew 28:18
.
"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, -- matthew 28:19
.
teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." -- matthew 28:20
.
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. -- mark 1:1
.
As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: "BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY; -- mark 1:2
.
THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.'" -- mark 1:3
.
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. -- mark 1:4
.
And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. -- mark 1:5
.
John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his diet was locusts and wild honey. -- mark 1:6
.
And he was preaching, and saying, "After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals. -- mark 1:7
.
"I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." -- mark 1:8
.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. -- mark 1:9
.
Immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him; -- mark 1:10
.
and a voice came out of the heavens: "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased." -- mark 1:11
.
Immediately the Spirit *impelled Him to go out into the wilderness. -- mark 1:12
.
And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him. -- mark 1:13
.
Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, -- mark 1:14
.
and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel." -- mark 1:15
.
As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. -- mark 1:16
.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men." -- mark 1:17
.
Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. -- mark 1:18
.
Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. -- mark 1:19
.
Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him. -- mark 1:20
.
They *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach. -- mark 1:21
.
They were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. -- mark 1:22
.
Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, -- mark 1:23
.
saying, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!" -- mark 1:24
.
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" -- mark 1:25
.
Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him. -- mark 1:26
.
They were all amazed, so that they debated among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him." -- mark 1:27
.
Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee. -- mark 1:28
.
And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. -- mark 1:29
.
Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they *spoke to Jesus about her. -- mark 1:30
.
And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she waited on them. -- mark 1:31
.
When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed. -- mark 1:32
.
And the whole city had gathered at the door. -- mark 1:33
.
And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who He was. -- mark 1:34
.
In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there. -- mark 1:35
.
Simon and his companions searched for Him; -- mark 1:36
.
they found Him, and *said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You." -- mark 1:37
.
He *said to them, "Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also; for that is what I came for." -- mark 1:38
.
And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out the demons. -- mark 1:39
.
And a leper *came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, "If You are willing, You can make me clean." -- mark 1:40
.
Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and *said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed." -- mark 1:41
.
Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. -- mark 1:42
.
And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away, -- mark 1:43
.
and He *said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." -- mark 1:44
.
But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere. -- mark 1:45
.
When He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home. -- mark 2:1
.
And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them. -- mark 2:2
.
And they *came, bringing to Him a paralytic, carried by four men. -- mark 2:3
.
Being unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Him; and when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying. -- mark 2:4
.
And Jesus seeing their faith *said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven." -- mark 2:5
.
But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, -- mark 2:6
.
"Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?" -- mark 2:7
.
Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, *said to them, "Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts? -- mark 2:8
.
"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven'; or to say, 'Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk'? -- mark 2:9
.
"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--He *said to the paralytic, -- mark 2:10
.
"I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet and go home." -- mark 2:11
.
And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this." -- mark 2:12
.
And He went out again by the seashore; and all the people were coming to Him, and He was teaching them. -- mark 2:13
.
As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax booth, and He *said to him, "Follow Me!" And he got up and followed Him. -- mark 2:14
.
And it *happened that He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many of them, and they were following Him. -- mark 2:15
.
When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they said to His disciples, "Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?" -- mark 2:16
.
And hearing this, Jesus *said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." -- mark 2:17
.
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they *came and *said to Him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?" -- mark 2:18
.
And Jesus said to them, "While the bridegroom is with them, the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast, can they? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. -- mark 2:19
.
"But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. -- mark 2:20
.
"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results. -- mark 2:21
.
"No one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins as well; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins." -- mark 2:22
.
And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain. -- mark 2:23
.
The Pharisees were saying to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?" -- mark 2:24
.
And He *said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry; -- mark 2:25
.
how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him?" -- mark 2:26
.
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. -- mark 2:27
.
"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath." -- mark 2:28
.
He entered again into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was withered. -- mark 3:1
.
They were watching Him to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him. -- mark 3:2
.
He *said to the man with the withered hand, "Get up and come forward!" -- mark 3:3
.
And He *said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?" But they kept silent. -- mark 3:4
.
After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. -- mark 3:5
.
The Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the Herodians against Him, as to how they might destroy Him. -- mark 3:6
.
Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and also from Judea, -- mark 3:7
.
and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard of all that He was doing and came to Him. -- mark 3:8
.
And He told His disciples that a boat should stand ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crowd Him; -- mark 3:9
.
for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around Him in order to touch Him. -- mark 3:10
.
Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and shout, "You are the Son of God!" -- mark 3:11
.
And He earnestly warned them not to tell who He was. -- mark 3:12
.
And He *went up on the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him. -- mark 3:13
.
And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach, -- mark 3:14
.
and to have authority to cast out the demons. -- mark 3:15
.
And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter), -- mark 3:16
.
and James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, "Sons of Thunder"); -- mark 3:17
.
and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot; -- mark 3:18
.
and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him. -- mark 3:19
.
And He *came home, and the crowd *gathered again, to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal. -- mark 3:20
.
When His own people heard of this, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, "He has lost His senses." -- mark 3:21
.
The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He is possessed by Beelzebul," and "He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons." -- mark 3:22
.
And He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan? -- mark 3:23
.
"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. -- mark 3:24
.
"If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. -- mark 3:25
.
"If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished! -- mark 3:26
.
"But no one can enter the strong man's house and plunder his property unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house. -- mark 3:27
.
"Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; -- mark 3:28
.
but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"-- -- mark 3:29
.
because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit." -- mark 3:30
.
Then His mother and His brothers *arrived, and standing outside they sent word to Him and called Him. -- mark 3:31
.
A crowd was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You." -- mark 3:32
.
Answering them, He *said, "Who are My mother and My brothers?" -- mark 3:33
.
Looking about at those who were sitting around Him, He *said, "Behold My mother and My brothers! -- mark 3:34
.
"For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother." -- mark 3:35
.
He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land. -- mark 4:1
.
And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching, -- mark 4:2
.
"Listen to this! Behold, the sower went out to sow; -- mark 4:3
.
as he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up. -- mark 4:4
.
"Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil. -- mark 4:5
.
"And after the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. -- mark 4:6
.
"Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop. -- mark 4:7
.
"Other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold." -- mark 4:8
.
And He was saying, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." -- mark 4:9
.
As soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, began asking Him about the parables. -- mark 4:10
.
And He was saying to them, "To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but those who are outside get everything in parables, -- mark 4:11
.
so that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE, AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND, OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN." -- mark 4:12
.
And He *said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables? -- mark 4:13
.
"The sower sows the word. -- mark 4:14
.
"These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them. -- mark 4:15
.
"In a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy; -- mark 4:16
.
and they have no firm root in themselves, but are only temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away. -- mark 4:17
.
"And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word, -- mark 4:18
.
but the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. -- mark 4:19
.
"And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold." -- mark 4:20
.
And He was saying to them, "A lamp is not brought to be put under a basket, is it, or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand? -- mark 4:21
.
"For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light. -- mark 4:22
.
"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear." -- mark 4:23
.
And He was saying to them, "Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and more will be given you besides. -- mark 4:24
.
"For whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him." -- mark 4:25
.
And He was saying, "The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil; -- mark 4:26
.
and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows--how, he himself does not know. -- mark 4:27
.
"The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head. -- mark 4:28
.
"But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come." -- mark 4:29
.
And He said, "How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it? -- mark 4:30
.
"It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil, -- mark 4:31
.
yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches; so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR can NEST UNDER ITS SHADE." -- mark 4:32
.
With many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to hear it; -- mark 4:33
.
and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples. -- mark 4:34
.
On that day, when evening came, He *said to them, "Let us go over to the other side." -- mark 4:35
.
Leaving the crowd, they *took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him. -- mark 4:36
.
And there *arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up. -- mark 4:37
.
Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they *woke Him and *said to Him, "Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?" -- mark 4:38
.
And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Hush, be still." And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm. -- mark 4:39
.
And He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?" -- mark 4:40
.
They became very much afraid and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?" -- mark 4:41
.
They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. -- mark 5:1
.
When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him, -- mark 5:2
.
and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain; -- mark 5:3
.
because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him. -- mark 5:4
.
Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones. -- mark 5:5
.
Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him; -- mark 5:6
.
and shouting with a loud voice, he *said, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!" -- mark 5:7
.
For He had been saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!" -- mark 5:8
.
And He was asking him, "What is your name?" And he *said to Him, "My name is Legion; for we are many." -- mark 5:9
.
And he began to implore Him earnestly not to send them out of the country. -- mark 5:10
.
Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain. -- mark 5:11
.
The demons implored Him, saying, "Send us into the swine so that we may enter them." -- mark 5:12
.
Jesus gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they were drowned in the sea. -- mark 5:13
.
Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And the people came to see what it was that had happened. -- mark 5:14
.
They *came to Jesus and *observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the "legion"; and they became frightened. -- mark 5:15
.
Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and all about the swine. -- mark 5:16
.
And they began to implore Him to leave their region. -- mark 5:17
.
As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might accompany Him. -- mark 5:18
.
And He did not let him, but He *said to him, "Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He had mercy on you." -- mark 5:19
.
And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed. -- mark 5:20
.
When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore. -- mark 5:21
.
One of the synagogue officials named Jairus *came up, and on seeing Him, *fell at His feet -- mark 5:22
.
and *implored Him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death; please come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will get well and live." -- mark 5:23
.
And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him. -- mark 5:24
.
A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years, -- mark 5:25
.
and had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse-- -- mark 5:26
.
after hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak. -- mark 5:27
.
For she thought, "If I just touch His garments, I will get well." -- mark 5:28
.
Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. -- mark 5:29
.
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched My garments?" -- mark 5:30
.
And His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'" -- mark 5:31
.
And He looked around to see the woman who had done this. -- mark 5:32
.
But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. -- mark 5:33
.
And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace and be healed of your affliction." -- mark 5:34
.
While He was still speaking, they *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher anymore?" -- mark 5:35
.
But Jesus, overhearing what was being spoken, *said to the synagogue official, "Do not be afraid any longer, only believe." -- mark 5:36
.
And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James. -- mark 5:37
.
They *came to the house of the synagogue official; and He *saw a commotion, and people loudly weeping and wailing. -- mark 5:38
.
And entering in, He *said to them, "Why make a commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is asleep." -- mark 5:39
.
They began laughing at Him. But putting them all out, He *took along the child's father and mother and His own companions, and *entered the room where the child was. -- mark 5:40
.
Taking the child by the hand, He *said to her, "Talitha kum!" (which translated means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!"). -- mark 5:41
.
Immediately the girl got up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded. -- mark 5:42
.
And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said that something should be given her to eat. -- mark 5:43
.
Jesus went out from there and *came into His hometown; and His disciples *followed Him. -- mark 6:1
.
When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands? -- mark 6:2
.
"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?" And they took offense at Him. -- mark 6:3
.
Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household." -- mark 6:4
.
And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. -- mark 6:5
.
And He wondered at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages teaching. -- mark 6:6
.
And He *summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits; -- mark 6:7
.
and He instructed them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a mere staff--no bread, no bag, no money in their belt-- -- mark 6:8
.
but to wear sandals; and He added, "Do not put on two tunics." -- mark 6:9
.
And He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave town. -- mark 6:10
.
"Any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them." -- mark 6:11
.
They went out and preached that men should repent. -- mark 6:12
.
And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them. -- mark 6:13
.
And King Herod heard of it, for His name had become well known; and people were saying, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him." -- mark 6:14
.
But others were saying, "He is Elijah." And others were saying, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old." -- mark 6:15
.
But when Herod heard of it, he kept saying, "John, whom I beheaded, has risen!" -- mark 6:16
.
For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her. -- mark 6:17
.
For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." -- mark 6:18
.
Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not do so; -- mark 6:19
.
for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him. -- mark 6:20
.
A strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his lords and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee; -- mark 6:21
.
and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you." -- mark 6:22
.
And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom." -- mark 6:23
.
And she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist." -- mark 6:24
.
Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." -- mark 6:25
.
And although the king was very sorry, yet because of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he was unwilling to refuse her. -- mark 6:26
.
Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head. And he went and had him beheaded in the prison, -- mark 6:27
.
and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. -- mark 6:28
.
When his disciples heard about this, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb. -- mark 6:29
.
The apostles *gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught. -- mark 6:30
.
And He *said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a while." (For there were many people coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.) -- mark 6:31
.
They went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves. -- mark 6:32
.
The people saw them going, and many recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them. -- mark 6:33
.
When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things. -- mark 6:34
.
When it was already quite late, His disciples came to Him and said, "This place is desolate and it is already quite late; -- mark 6:35
.
send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat." -- mark 6:36
.
But He answered them, "You give them something to eat!" And they *said to Him, "Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give them something to eat?" -- mark 6:37
.
And He *said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go look!" And when they found out, they *said, "Five, and two fish." -- mark 6:38
.
And He commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass. -- mark 6:39
.
They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties. -- mark 6:40
.
And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food and broke the loaves and He kept giving them to the disciples to set before them; and He divided up the two fish among them all. -- mark 6:41
.
They all ate and were satisfied, -- mark 6:42
.
and they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish. -- mark 6:43
.
There were five thousand men who ate the loaves. -- mark 6:44
.
Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while He Himself was sending the crowd away. -- mark 6:45
.
After bidding them farewell, He left for the mountain to pray. -- mark 6:46
.
When it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land. -- mark 6:47
.
Seeing them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night He *came to them, walking on the sea; and He intended to pass by them. -- mark 6:48
.
But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; -- mark 6:49
.
for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and *said to them, "Take courage; it is I, do not be afraid." -- mark 6:50
.
Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were utterly astonished, -- mark 6:51
.
for they had not gained any insight from the incident of the loaves, but their heart was hardened. -- mark 6:52
.
When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. -- mark 6:53
.
When they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him, -- mark 6:54
.
and ran about that whole country and began to carry here and there on their pallets those who were sick, to the place they heard He was. -- mark 6:55
.
Wherever He entered villages, or cities, or countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places, and imploring Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were being cured. -- mark 6:56
.
The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem, -- mark 7:1
.
and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed. -- mark 7:2
.
(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the traditions of the elders; -- mark 7:3
.
and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.) -- mark 7:4
.
The Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?" -- mark 7:5
.
And He said to them, "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME. -- mark 7:6
.
'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.' -- mark 7:7
.
"Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men." -- mark 7:8
.
He was also saying to them, "You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition. -- mark 7:9
.
"For Moses said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER'; and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH'; -- mark 7:10
.
but you say, 'If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is to say, given to God),' -- mark 7:11
.
you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother; -- mark 7:12
.
thus invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that." -- mark 7:13
.
After He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them, "Listen to Me, all of you, and understand: -- mark 7:14
.
there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man. -- mark 7:15
.
["If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."] -- mark 7:16
.
When he had left the crowd and entered the house, His disciples questioned Him about the parable. -- mark 7:17
.
And He *said to them, "Are you so lacking in understanding also? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him, -- mark 7:18
.
because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?" (Thus He declared all foods clean.) -- mark 7:19
.
And He was saying, "That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man. -- mark 7:20
.
"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, -- mark 7:21
.
deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and foolishness. -- mark 7:22
.
"All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man." -- mark 7:23
.
Jesus got up and went away from there to the region of Tyre. And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know of it; yet He could not escape notice. -- mark 7:24
.
But after hearing of Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet. -- mark 7:25
.
Now the woman was a Gentile, of the Syrophoenician race. And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter. -- mark 7:26
.
And He was saying to her, "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." -- mark 7:27
.
But she answered and *said to Him, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table feed on the children's crumbs." -- mark 7:28
.
And He said to her, "Because of this answer go; the demon has gone out of your daughter." -- mark 7:29
.
And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, the demon having left. -- mark 7:30
.
Again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis. -- mark 7:31
.
They *brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they *implored Him to lay His hand on him. -- mark 7:32
.
Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva; -- mark 7:33
.
and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He *said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!" -- mark 7:34
.
And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly. -- mark 7:35
.
And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it. -- mark 7:36
.
They were utterly astonished, saying, "He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak." -- mark 7:37
.
In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and *said to them, -- mark 8:1
.
"I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat. -- mark 8:2
.
"If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance." -- mark 8:3
.
And His disciples answered Him, "Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people?" -- mark 8:4
.
And He was asking them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven." -- mark 8:5
.
And He *directed the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and started giving them to His disciples to serve to them, and they served them to the people. -- mark 8:6
.
They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well. -- mark 8:7
.
And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces. -- mark 8:8
.
About four thousand were there; and He sent them away. -- mark 8:9
.
And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha. -- mark 8:10
.
The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him. -- mark 8:11
.
Sighing deeply in His spirit, He *said, "Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation." -- mark 8:12
.
Leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side. -- mark 8:13
.
And they had forgotten to take bread, and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them. -- mark 8:14
.
And He was giving orders to them, saying, "Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod." -- mark 8:15
.
They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread. -- mark 8:16
.
And Jesus, aware of this, *said to them, "Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet see or understand? Do you have a hardened heart? -- mark 8:17
.
"HAVING EYES, DO YOU NOT SEE? AND HAVING EARS, DO YOU NOT HEAR? And do you not remember, -- mark 8:18
.
when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up?" They *said to Him, "Twelve." -- mark 8:19
.
"When I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?" And they *said to Him, "Seven." -- mark 8:20
.
And He was saying to them, "Do you not yet understand?" -- mark 8:21
.
And they *came to Bethsaida. And they *brought a blind man to Jesus and *implored Him to touch him. -- mark 8:22
.
Taking the blind man by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, "Do you see anything?" -- mark 8:23
.
And he looked up and said, "I see men, for I see them like trees, walking around." -- mark 8:24
.
Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly. -- mark 8:25
.
And He sent him to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village." -- mark 8:26
.
Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, "Who do people say that I am?" -- mark 8:27
.
They told Him, saying, "John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets." -- mark 8:28
.
And He continued by questioning them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter *answered and *said to Him, "You are the Christ." -- mark 8:29
.
And He warned them to tell no one about Him. -- mark 8:30
.
And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. -- mark 8:31
.
And He was stating the matter plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. -- mark 8:32
.
But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and *said, "Get behind Me, Satan; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's." -- mark 8:33
.
And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to them, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me. -- mark 8:34
.
"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's will save it. -- mark 8:35
.
"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? -- mark 8:36
.
"For what will a man give in exchange for his soul? -- mark 8:37
.
"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels." -- mark 8:38
.
And Jesus was saying to them, "Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power." -- mark 9:1
.
Six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them; -- mark 9:2
.
and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them. -- mark 9:3
.
Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. -- mark 9:4
.
Peter *said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah." -- mark 9:5
.
For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified. -- mark 9:6
.
Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!" -- mark 9:7
.
All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone. -- mark 9:8
.
As they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man rose from the dead. -- mark 9:9
.
They seized upon that statement, discussing with one another what rising from the dead meant. -- mark 9:10
.
They asked Him, saying, "Why is it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" -- mark 9:11
.
And He said to them, "Elijah does first come and restore all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt? -- mark 9:12
.
"But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him." -- mark 9:13
.
When they came back to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and some scribes arguing with them. -- mark 9:14
.
Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed and began running up to greet Him. -- mark 9:15
.
And He asked them, "What are you discussing with them?" -- mark 9:16
.
And one of the crowd answered Him, "Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute; -- mark 9:17
.
and whenever it seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not do it." -- mark 9:18
.
And He *answered them and *said, "O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!" -- mark 9:19
.
They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth. -- mark 9:20
.
And He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood. -- mark 9:21
.
"It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!" -- mark 9:22
.
And Jesus said to him, " 'If You can?' All things are possible to him who believes." -- mark 9:23
.
Immediately the boy's father cried out and said, "I do believe; help my unbelief." -- mark 9:24
.
When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again." -- mark 9:25
.
After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said, "He is dead!" -- mark 9:26
.
But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up. -- mark 9:27
.
When He came into the house, His disciples began questioning Him privately, "Why could we not drive it out?" -- mark 9:28
.
And He said to them, "This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer." -- mark 9:29
.
From there they went out and began to go through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know about it. -- mark 9:30
.
For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days later." -- mark 9:31
.
But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him. -- mark 9:32
.
They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He began to question them, "What were you discussing on the way?" -- mark 9:33
.
But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest. -- mark 9:34
.
Sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all." -- mark 9:35
.
Taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them, -- mark 9:36
.
"Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me." -- mark 9:37
.
John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us." -- mark 9:38
.
But Jesus said, "Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me. -- mark 9:39
.
"For he who is not against us is for us. -- mark 9:40
.
"For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward. -- mark 9:41
.
"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea. -- mark 9:42
.
"If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire, -- mark 9:43
.
[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.] -- mark 9:44
.
"If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell, -- mark 9:45
.
[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.] -- mark 9:46
.
"If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell, -- mark 9:47
.
where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED. -- mark 9:48
.
"For everyone will be salted with fire. -- mark 9:49
.
"Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another." -- mark 9:50
.
Getting up, He *went from there to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; crowds *gathered around Him again, and, according to His custom, He once more began to teach them. -- mark 10:1
.
Some Pharisees came up to Jesus, testing Him, and began to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife. -- mark 10:2
.
And He answered and said to them, "What did Moses command you?" -- mark 10:3
.
They said, "Moses permitted a man TO WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY." -- mark 10:4
.
But Jesus said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. -- mark 10:5
.
"But from the beginning of creation, God MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE. -- mark 10:6
.
"FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, -- mark 10:7
.
AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH; so they are no longer two, but one flesh. -- mark 10:8
.
"What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." -- mark 10:9
.
In the house the disciples began questioning Him about this again. -- mark 10:10
.
And He *said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her; -- mark 10:11
.
and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery." -- mark 10:12
.
And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them. -- mark 10:13
.
But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, "Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. -- mark 10:14
.
"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all." -- mark 10:15
.
And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them. -- mark 10:16
.
As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and asked Him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" -- mark 10:17
.
And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone. -- mark 10:18
.
"You know the commandments, 'DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, Do not defraud, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.'" -- mark 10:19
.
And he said to Him, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up." -- mark 10:20
.
Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him, "One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me." -- mark 10:21
.
But at these words he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned much property. -- mark 10:22
.
And Jesus, looking around, *said to His disciples, "How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!" -- mark 10:23
.
The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus *answered again and *said to them, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! -- mark 10:24
.
"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." -- mark 10:25
.
They were even more astonished and said to Him, "Then who can be saved?" -- mark 10:26
.
Looking at them, Jesus *said, "With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God." -- mark 10:27
.
Peter began to say to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You." -- mark 10:28
.
Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel's sake, -- mark 10:29
.
but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life. -- mark 10:30
.
"But many who are first will be last, and the last, first." -- mark 10:31
.
They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him, -- mark 10:32
.
saying, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will hand Him over to the Gentiles. -- mark 10:33
.
"They will mock Him and spit on Him, and scourge Him and kill Him, and three days later He will rise again." -- mark 10:34
.
James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Jesus, saying, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You." -- mark 10:35
.
And He said to them, "What do you want Me to do for you?" -- mark 10:36
.
They said to Him, "Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory." -- mark 10:37
.
But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?" -- mark 10:38
.
They said to Him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. -- mark 10:39
.
"But to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared." -- mark 10:40
.
Hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John. -- mark 10:41
.
Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. -- mark 10:42
.
"But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; -- mark 10:43
.
and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. -- mark 10:44
.
"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many." -- mark 10:45
.
Then they *came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road. -- mark 10:46
.
When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" -- mark 10:47
.
Many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" -- mark 10:48
.
And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him here." So they *called the blind man, saying to him, "Take courage, stand up! He is calling for you." -- mark 10:49
.
Throwing aside his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus. -- mark 10:50
.
And answering him, Jesus said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" And the blind man said to Him, "Rabboni, I want to regain my sight!" -- mark 10:51
.
And Jesus said to him, "Go; your faith has made you well." Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road. -- mark 10:52
.
As they *approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, He *sent two of His disciples, -- mark 11:1
.
and *said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here. -- mark 11:2
.
"If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' you say, 'The Lord has need of it'; and immediately he will send it back here." -- mark 11:3
.
They went away and found a colt tied at the door, outside in the street; and they *untied it. -- mark 11:4
.
Some of the bystanders were saying to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?" -- mark 11:5
.
They spoke to them just as Jesus had told them, and they gave them permission. -- mark 11:6
.
They *brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it. -- mark 11:7
.
And many spread their coats in the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields. -- mark 11:8
.
Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting: "Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; -- mark 11:9
.
Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David; Hosanna in the highest!" -- mark 11:10
.
Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple; and after looking around at everything, He left for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late. -- mark 11:11
.
On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry. -- mark 11:12
.
Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. -- mark 11:13
.
He said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" And His disciples were listening. -- mark 11:14
.
Then they *came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves; -- mark 11:15
.
and He would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple. -- mark 11:16
.
And He began to teach and say to them, "Is it not written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS'? But you have made it a ROBBERS' DEN." -- mark 11:17
.
The chief priests and the scribes heard this, and began seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching. -- mark 11:18
.
When evening came, they would go out of the city. -- mark 11:19
.
As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up. -- mark 11:20
.
Being reminded, Peter *said to Him, "Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered." -- mark 11:21
.
And Jesus *answered saying to them, "Have faith in God. -- mark 11:22
.
"Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him. -- mark 11:23
.
"Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you. -- mark 11:24
.
"Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions. -- mark 11:25
.
["But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions."] -- mark 11:26
.
They *came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders *came to Him, -- mark 11:27
.
and began saying to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?" -- mark 11:28
.
And Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question, and you answer Me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things. -- mark 11:29
.
"Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? Answer Me." -- mark 11:30
.
They began reasoning among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?' -- mark 11:31
.
"But shall we say, 'From men'?"--they were afraid of the people, for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet. -- mark 11:32
.
Answering Jesus, they *said, "We do not know." And Jesus *said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things." -- mark 11:33
.
And He began to speak to them in parables: "A man PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT, AND DUG A VAT UNDER THE WINE PRESS AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey. -- mark 12:1
.
"At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in order to receive some of the produce of the vineyard from the vine-growers. -- mark 12:2
.
"They took him, and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. -- mark 12:3
.
"Again he sent them another slave, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully. -- mark 12:4
.
"And he sent another, and that one they killed; and so with many others, beating some and killing others. -- mark 12:5
.
"He had one more to send, a beloved son; he sent him last of all to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' -- mark 12:6
.
"But those vine-growers said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!' -- mark 12:7
.
"They took him, and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. -- mark 12:8
.
"What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine-growers, and will give the vineyard to others. -- mark 12:9
.
"Have you not even read this Scripture: 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone; -- mark 12:10
.
THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'?" -- mark 12:11
.
And they were seeking to seize Him, and yet they feared the people, for they understood that He spoke the parable against them. And so they left Him and went away. -- mark 12:12
.
Then they *sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him in order to trap Him in a statement. -- mark 12:13
.
They *came and *said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not? -- mark 12:14
.
"Shall we pay or shall we not pay?" But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at." -- mark 12:15
.
They brought one. And He *said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" And they said to Him, "Caesar's." -- mark 12:16
.
And Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were amazed at Him. -- mark 12:17
.
Some Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) *came to Jesus, and began questioning Him, saying, -- mark 12:18
.
"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN'S BROTHER DIES and leaves behind a wife AND LEAVES NO CHILD, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER. -- mark 12:19
.
"There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no children. -- mark 12:20
.
"The second one married her, and died leaving behind no children; and the third likewise; -- mark 12:21
.
and so all seven left no children. Last of all the woman died also. -- mark 12:22
.
"In the resurrection, when they rise again, which one's wife will she be? For all seven had married her." -- mark 12:23
.
Jesus said to them, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God? -- mark 12:24
.
"For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. -- mark 12:25
.
"But regarding the fact that the dead rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, and the God of Jacob'? -- mark 12:26
.
"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken." -- mark 12:27
.
One of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, "What commandment is the foremost of all?" -- mark 12:28
.
Jesus answered, "The foremost is, 'HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD; -- mark 12:29
.
AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH.' -- mark 12:30
.
"The second is this, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.' There is no other commandment greater than these." -- mark 12:31
.
The scribe said to Him, "Right, Teacher; You have truly stated that HE IS ONE, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE BESIDES HIM; -- mark 12:32
.
AND TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH ALL THE UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices." -- mark 12:33
.
When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that, no one would venture to ask Him any more questions. -- mark 12:34
.
And Jesus began to say, as He taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? -- mark 12:35
.
"David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET."' -- mark 12:36
.
"David himself calls Him 'Lord'; so in what sense is He his son?" And the large crowd enjoyed listening to Him. -- mark 12:37
.
In His teaching He was saying: "Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes, and like respectful greetings in the market places, -- mark 12:38
.
and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets, -- mark 12:39
.
who devour widows' houses, and for appearance's sake offer long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation." -- mark 12:40
.
And He sat down opposite the treasury, and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury; and many rich people were putting in large sums. -- mark 12:41
.
A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent. -- mark 12:42
.
Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury; -- mark 12:43
.
for they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on." -- mark 12:44
.
As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples *said to Him, "Teacher, behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!" -- mark 13:1
.
And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another which will not be torn down." -- mark 13:2
.
As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately, -- mark 13:3
.
"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?" -- mark 13:4
.
And Jesus began to say to them, "See to it that no one misleads you. -- mark 13:5
.
"Many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He!' and will mislead many. -- mark 13:6
.
"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be frightened; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end. -- mark 13:7
.
"For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are merely the beginning of birth pangs. -- mark 13:8
.
"But be on your guard; for they will deliver you to the courts, and you will be flogged in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them. -- mark 13:9
.
"The gospel must first be preached to all the nations. -- mark 13:10
.
"When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit. -- mark 13:11
.
"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. -- mark 13:12
.
"You will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. -- mark 13:13
.
"But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. -- mark 13:14
.
"The one who is on the housetop must not go down, or go in to get anything out of his house; -- mark 13:15
.
and the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat. -- mark 13:16
.
"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! -- mark 13:17
.
"But pray that it may not happen in the winter. -- mark 13:18
.
"For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will. -- mark 13:19
.
"Unless the Lord had shortened those days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days. -- mark 13:20
.
"And then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ'; or, 'Behold, He is there'; do not believe him; -- mark 13:21
.
for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect. -- mark 13:22
.
"But take heed; behold, I have told you everything in advance. -- mark 13:23
.
"But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, -- mark 13:24
.
AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. -- mark 13:25
.
"Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory. -- mark 13:26
.
"And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven. -- mark 13:27
.
"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. -- mark 13:28
.
"Even so, you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the door. -- mark 13:29
.
"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. -- mark 13:30
.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. -- mark 13:31
.
"But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. -- mark 13:32
.
"Take heed, keep on the alert; for you do not know when the appointed time will come. -- mark 13:33
.
"It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert. -- mark 13:34
.
"Therefore, be on the alert--for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning-- -- mark 13:35
.
in case he should come suddenly and find you asleep. -- mark 13:36
.
"What I say to you I say to all, 'Be on the alert!'" -- mark 13:37
.
Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by stealth and kill Him; -- mark 14:1
.
for they were saying, "Not during the festival, otherwise there might be a riot of the people." -- mark 14:2
.
While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining at the table, there came a woman with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume of pure nard; and she broke the vial and poured it over His head. -- mark 14:3
.
But some were indignantly remarking to one another, "Why has this perfume been wasted? -- mark 14:4
.
"For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor." And they were scolding her. -- mark 14:5
.
But Jesus said, "Let her alone; why do you bother her? She has done a good deed to Me. -- mark 14:6
.
"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me. -- mark 14:7
.
"She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial. -- mark 14:8
.
"Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her." -- mark 14:9
.
Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them. -- mark 14:10
.
They were glad when they heard this, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time. -- mark 14:11
.
On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, His disciples *said to Him, "Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?" -- mark 14:12
.
And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them, "Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him; -- mark 14:13
.
and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"' -- mark 14:14
.
"And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there." -- mark 14:15
.
The disciples went out and came to the city, and found it just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover. -- mark 14:16
.
When it was evening He *came with the twelve. -- mark 14:17
.
As they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me--one who is eating with Me." -- mark 14:18
.
They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, "Surely not I?" -- mark 14:19
.
And He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl. -- mark 14:20
.
"For the Son of Man is to go just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born." -- mark 14:21
.
While they were eating, He took some bread, and after a blessing He broke it, and gave it to them, and said, "Take it; this is My body." -- mark 14:22
.
And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it. -- mark 14:23
.
And He said to them, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. -- mark 14:24
.
"Truly I say to you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God." -- mark 14:25
.
After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. -- mark 14:26
.
And Jesus *said to them, "You will all fall away, because it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.' -- mark 14:27
.
"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee." -- mark 14:28
.
But Peter said to Him, "Even though all may fall away, yet I will not." -- mark 14:29
.
And Jesus *said to him, "Truly I say to you, that this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny Me three times." -- mark 14:30
.
But Peter kept saying insistently, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And they all were saying the same thing also. -- mark 14:31
.
They *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, "Sit here until I have prayed." -- mark 14:32
.
And He *took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled. -- mark 14:33
.
And He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch." -- mark 14:34
.
And He went a little beyond them, and fell to the ground and began to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him by. -- mark 14:35
.
And He was saying, "Abba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will." -- mark 14:36
.
And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? -- mark 14:37
.
"Keep watching and praying that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." -- mark 14:38
.
Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words. -- mark 14:39
.
And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him. -- mark 14:40
.
And He *came the third time, and *said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. -- mark 14:41
.
"Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!" -- mark 14:42
.
Immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who were from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. -- mark 14:43
.
Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard." -- mark 14:44
.
After coming, Judas immediately went to Him, saying, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him. -- mark 14:45
.
They laid hands on Him and seized Him. -- mark 14:46
.
But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. -- mark 14:47
.
And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as you would against a robber? -- mark 14:48
.
"Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me; but this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures." -- mark 14:49
.
And they all left Him and fled. -- mark 14:50
.
A young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body; and they *seized him. -- mark 14:51
.
But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked. -- mark 14:52
.
They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes *gathered together. -- mark 14:53
.
Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire. -- mark 14:54
.
Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any. -- mark 14:55
.
For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent. -- mark 14:56
.
Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him, saying, -- mark 14:57
.
"We heard Him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'" -- mark 14:58
.
Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent. -- mark 14:59
.
The high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus, saying, "Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?" -- mark 14:60
.
But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, "Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?" -- mark 14:61
.
And Jesus said, "I am; and you shall see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN." -- mark 14:62
.
Tearing his clothes, the high priest *said, "What further need do we have of witnesses? -- mark 14:63
.
"You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?" And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death. -- mark 14:64
.
Some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, "Prophesy!" And the officers received Him with slaps in the face. -- mark 14:65
.
As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest *came, -- mark 14:66
.
and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and *said, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene." -- mark 14:67
.
But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about." And he went out onto the porch. -- mark 14:68
.
The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, "This is one of them!" -- mark 14:69
.
But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean too." -- mark 14:70
.
But he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about!" -- mark 14:71
.
Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, "Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times." And he began to weep. -- mark 14:72
.
Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Council, immediately held a consultation; and binding Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate. -- mark 15:1
.
Pilate questioned Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He *answered him, "It is as you say." -- mark 15:2
.
The chief priests began to accuse Him harshly. -- mark 15:3
.
Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, "Do You not answer? See how many charges they bring against You!" -- mark 15:4
.
But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate was amazed. -- mark 15:5
.
Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested. -- mark 15:6
.
The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection. -- mark 15:7
.
The crowd went up and began asking him to do as he had been accustomed to do for them. -- mark 15:8
.
Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?" -- mark 15:9
.
For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy. -- mark 15:10
.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead. -- mark 15:11
.
Answering again, Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?" -- mark 15:12
.
They shouted back, "Crucify Him!" -- mark 15:13
.
But Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify Him!" -- mark 15:14
.
Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified. -- mark 15:15
.
The soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole Roman cohort. -- mark 15:16
.
They *dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on Him; -- mark 15:17
.
and they began to acclaim Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" -- mark 15:18
.
They kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting on Him, and kneeling and bowing before Him. -- mark 15:19
.
After they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His own garments on Him. And they *led Him out to crucify Him. -- mark 15:20
.
They *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross. -- mark 15:21
.
Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. -- mark 15:22
.
They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it. -- mark 15:23
.
And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them to decide what each man should take. -- mark 15:24
.
It was the third hour when they crucified Him. -- mark 15:25
.
The inscription of the charge against Him read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS." -- mark 15:26
.
They *crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left. -- mark 15:27
.
[And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with transgressors."] -- mark 15:28
.
Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, -- mark 15:29
.
save Yourself, and come down from the cross!" -- mark 15:30
.
In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking Him among themselves and saying, "He saved others; He cannot save Himself. -- mark 15:31
.
"Let this Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!" Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him. -- mark 15:32
.
When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour. -- mark 15:33
.
At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" which is translated, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?" -- mark 15:34
.
When some of the bystanders heard it, they began saying, "Behold, He is calling for Elijah." -- mark 15:35
.
Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down." -- mark 15:36
.
And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last. -- mark 15:37
.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. -- mark 15:38
.
When the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!" -- mark 15:39
.
There were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome. -- mark 15:40
.
When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem. -- mark 15:41
.
When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, -- mark 15:42
.
Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. -- mark 15:43
.
Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead. -- mark 15:44
.
And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. -- mark 15:45
.
Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. -- mark 15:46
.
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was laid. -- mark 15:47
.
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him. -- mark 16:1
.
Very early on the first day of the week, they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen. -- mark 16:2
.
They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?" -- mark 16:3
.
Looking up, they *saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was extremely large. -- mark 16:4
.
Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed. -- mark 16:5
.
And he *said to them, "Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, here is the place where they laid Him. -- mark 16:6
.
"But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.'" -- mark 16:7
.
They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. -- mark 16:8
.
[Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons. -- mark 16:9
.
She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. -- mark 16:10
.
When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it. -- mark 16:11
.
After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along on their way to the country. -- mark 16:12
.
They went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either. -- mark 16:13
.
Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen. -- mark 16:14
.
And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. -- mark 16:15
.
"He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned. -- mark 16:16
.
"These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues; -- mark 16:17
.
they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover." -- mark 16:18
.
So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. -- mark 16:19
.
And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them, and confirmed the word by the signs that followed.] [And they promptly reported all these instructions to Peter and his companions. And after that, Jesus Himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.] -- mark 16:20
.
Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us, -- luke 1:1
.
just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, -- luke 1:2
.
it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus; -- luke 1:3
.
so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught. -- luke 1:4
.
In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. -- luke 1:5
.
They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord. -- luke 1:6
.
But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years. -- luke 1:7
.
Now it happened that while he was performing his priestly service before God in the appointed order of his division, -- luke 1:8
.
according to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. -- luke 1:9
.
And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense offering. -- luke 1:10
.
And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense. -- luke 1:11
.
Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear gripped him. -- luke 1:12
.
But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John. -- luke 1:13
.
"You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. -- luke 1:14
.
"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and he will drink no wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb. -- luke 1:15
.
"And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God. -- luke 1:16
.
"It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." -- luke 1:17
.
Zacharias said to the angel, "How will I know this for certain? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years." -- luke 1:18
.
The angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. -- luke 1:19
.
"And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time." -- luke 1:20
.
The people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering at his delay in the temple. -- luke 1:21
.
But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute. -- luke 1:22
.
When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went back home. -- luke 1:23
.
After these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying, -- luke 1:24
.
"This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked with favor upon me, to take away my disgrace among men." -- luke 1:25
.
Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, -- luke 1:26
.
to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. -- luke 1:27
.
And coming in, he said to her, "Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you." -- luke 1:28
.
But she was very perplexed at this statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was. -- luke 1:29
.
The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God. -- luke 1:30
.
"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus. -- luke 1:31
.
"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; -- luke 1:32
.
and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end." -- luke 1:33
.
Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?" -- luke 1:34
.
The angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God. -- luke 1:35
.
"And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month. -- luke 1:36
.
"For nothing will be impossible with God." -- luke 1:37
.
And Mary said, "Behold, the bondslave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her. -- luke 1:38
.
Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah, -- luke 1:39
.
and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. -- luke 1:40
.
When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. -- luke 1:41
.
And she cried out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! -- luke 1:42
.
"And how has it happened to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me? -- luke 1:43
.
"For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy. -- luke 1:44
.
"And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord." -- luke 1:45
.
And Mary said: "My soul exalts the Lord, -- luke 1:46
.
And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. -- luke 1:47
.
"For He has had regard for the humble state of His bondslave; For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed. -- luke 1:48
.
"For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name. -- luke 1:49
.
"AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM. -- luke 1:50
.
"He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart. -- luke 1:51
.
"He has brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble. -- luke 1:52
.
"HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS; And sent away the rich empty-handed. -- luke 1:53
.
"He has given help to Israel His servant, In remembrance of His mercy, -- luke 1:54
.
As He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants forever." -- luke 1:55
.
And Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her home. -- luke 1:56
.
Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son. -- luke 1:57
.
Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had displayed His great mercy toward her; and they were rejoicing with her. -- luke 1:58
.
And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him Zacharias, after his father. -- luke 1:59
.
But his mother answered and said, "No indeed; but he shall be called John." -- luke 1:60
.
And they said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name." -- luke 1:61
.
And they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called. -- luke 1:62
.
And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows, "His name is John." And they were all astonished. -- luke 1:63
.
And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak in praise of God. -- luke 1:64
.
Fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea. -- luke 1:65
.
All who heard them kept them in mind, saying, "What then will this child turn out to be?" For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him. -- luke 1:66
.
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying: -- luke 1:67
.
"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people, -- luke 1:68
.
And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of David His servant-- -- luke 1:69
.
As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old-- -- luke 1:70
.
Salvation FROM OUR ENEMIES, And FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US; -- luke 1:71
.
To show mercy toward our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant, -- luke 1:72
.
The oath which He swore to Abraham our father, -- luke 1:73
.
To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Might serve Him without fear, -- luke 1:74
.
In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days. -- luke 1:75
.
"And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; For you will go on BEFORE THE LORD TO PREPARE HIS WAYS; -- luke 1:76
.
To give to His people the knowledge of salvation By the forgiveness of their sins, -- luke 1:77
.
Because of the tender mercy of our God, With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us, -- luke 1:78
.
TO SHINE UPON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, To guide our feet into the way of peace." -- luke 1:79
.
And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel. -- luke 1:80
.
Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. -- luke 2:1
.
This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. -- luke 2:2
.
And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city. -- luke 2:3
.
Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, -- luke 2:4
.
in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child. -- luke 2:5

.

.
"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased." -- luke 2:14

and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, "A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS." -- luke 2:24
