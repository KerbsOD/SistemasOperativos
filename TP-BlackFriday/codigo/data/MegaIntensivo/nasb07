Cast your bread on the surface of the waters, for you will find it after many days. -- ecclesiastes 11:1

If the clouds are full, they pour out rain upon the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, wherever the tree falls, there it lies. -- ecclesiastes 11:3
.
He who watches the wind will not sow and he who looks at the clouds will not reap. -- ecclesiastes 11:4

.
and the doors on the street are shut as the sound of the grinding mill is low, and one will arise at the sound of the bird, and all the daughters of song will sing softly. -- ecclesiastes 12:4
.
Furthermore, men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags himself along, and the caperberry is ineffective. For man goes to his eternal home while mourners go about in the street. -- ecclesiastes 12:5
.
Remember Him before the silver cord is broken and the golden bowl is crushed, the pitcher by the well is shattered and the wheel at the cistern is crushed; -- ecclesiastes 12:6

Now it will come about that In the last days The mountain of the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains, And will be raised above the hills; And all the nations will stream to it. -- isaiah 2:2
.
And many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To the house of the God of Jacob; That He may teach us concerning His ways And that we may walk in His paths." For the law will go forth from Zion And the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. -- isaiah 2:3
.
And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war. -- isaiah 2:4
.
Come, house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of the LORD. -- isaiah 2:5
.
For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob, Because they are filled with influences from the east, And they are soothsayers like the Philistines, And they strike bargains with the children of foreigners. -- isaiah 2:6
.
Their land has also been filled with silver and gold And there is no end to their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses And there is no end to their chariots. -- isaiah 2:7
.
Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the work of their hands, That which their fingers have made. -- isaiah 2:8
.
So the common man has been humbled And the man of importance has been abased, But do not forgive them. -- isaiah 2:9
.
Enter the rock and hide in the dust From the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty. -- isaiah 2:10
.
The proud look of man will be abased And the loftiness of man will be humbled, And the LORD alone will be exalted in that day. -- isaiah 2:11
.
For the LORD of hosts will have a day of reckoning Against everyone who is proud and lofty And against everyone who is lifted up, That he may be abased. -- isaiah 2:12
.
And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up, Against all the oaks of Bashan, -- isaiah 2:13
.
Against all the lofty mountains, Against all the hills that are lifted up, -- isaiah 2:14
.
Against every high tower, Against every fortified wall, -- isaiah 2:15
.
Against all the ships of Tarshish And against all the beautiful craft. -- isaiah 2:16
.
The pride of man will be humbled And the loftiness of men will be abased; And the LORD alone will be exalted in that day, -- isaiah 2:17
.
But the idols will completely vanish. -- isaiah 2:18
.
Men will go into caves of the rocks And into holes of the ground Before the terror of the LORD And the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to make the earth tremble. -- isaiah 2:19
.
In that day men will cast away to the moles and the bats Their idols of silver and their idols of gold, Which they made for themselves to worship, -- isaiah 2:20
.
In order to go into the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs Before the terror of the LORD and the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to make the earth tremble. -- isaiah 2:21
.
Stop regarding man, whose breath of life is in his nostrils; For why should he be esteemed? -- isaiah 2:22
.
For behold, the Lord GOD of hosts is going to remove from Jerusalem and Judah Both supply and support, the whole supply of bread And the whole supply of water; -- isaiah 3:1
.
The mighty man and the warrior, The judge and the prophet, The diviner and the elder, -- isaiah 3:2
.
The captain of fifty and the honorable man, The counselor and the expert artisan, And the skillful enchanter. -- isaiah 3:3
.
And I will make mere lads their princes, And capricious children will rule over them, -- isaiah 3:4
.
And the people will be oppressed, Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor; The youth will storm against the elder And the inferior against the honorable. -- isaiah 3:5
.
When a man lays hold of his brother in his father's house, saying, "You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler, And these ruins will be under your charge," -- isaiah 3:6
.
He will protest on that day, saying, "I will not be your healer, For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; You should not appoint me ruler of the people." -- isaiah 3:7
.
For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen, Because their speech and their actions are against the LORD, To rebel against His glorious presence. -- isaiah 3:8
.
The expression of their faces bears witness against them, And they display their sin like Sodom; They do not even conceal it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves. -- isaiah 3:9
.
Say to the righteous that it will go well with them, For they will eat the fruit of their actions. -- isaiah 3:10
.
Woe to the wicked! It will go badly with him, For what he deserves will be done to him. -- isaiah 3:11
.
O My people! Their oppressors are children, And women rule over them. O My people! Those who guide you lead you astray And confuse the direction of your paths. -- isaiah 3:12
.
The LORD arises to contend, And stands to judge the people. -- isaiah 3:13
.
The LORD enters into judgment with the elders and princes of His people, "It is you who have devoured the vineyard; The plunder of the poor is in your houses. -- isaiah 3:14
.
"What do you mean by crushing My people And grinding the face of the poor?" Declares the Lord GOD of hosts. -- isaiah 3:15
.
Moreover, the LORD said, "Because the daughters of Zion are proud And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, And go along with mincing steps And tinkle the bangles on their feet, -- isaiah 3:16
.
Therefore the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, And the LORD will make their foreheads bare." -- isaiah 3:17
.
In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments, -- isaiah 3:18
.
dangling earrings, bracelets, veils, -- isaiah 3:19
.
headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, -- isaiah 3:20
.
finger rings, nose rings, -- isaiah 3:21
.
festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses, -- isaiah 3:22
.
hand mirrors, undergarments, turbans and veils. -- isaiah 3:23
.
Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume there will be putrefaction; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp; Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth; And branding instead of beauty. -- isaiah 3:24
.
Your men will fall by the sword And your mighty ones in battle. -- isaiah 3:25
.
And her gates will lament and mourn, And deserted she will sit on the ground. -- isaiah 3:26
.
For seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach!" -- isaiah 4:1
.
In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride and the adornment of the survivors of Israel. -- isaiah 4:2
.
It will come about that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy--everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem. -- isaiah 4:3
.
When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and purged the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning, -- isaiah 4:4
.
then the LORD will create over the whole area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy. -- isaiah 4:5
.
There will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and refuge and protection from the storm and the rain. -- isaiah 4:6
.
Let me sing now for my well-beloved A song of my beloved concerning His vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill. -- isaiah 5:1
.
He dug it all around, removed its stones, And planted it with the choicest vine. And He built a tower in the middle of it And also hewed out a wine vat in it; Then He expected it to produce good grapes, But it produced only worthless ones. -- isaiah 5:2
.
"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, Judge between Me and My vineyard. -- isaiah 5:3
.
"What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected it to produce good grapes did it produce worthless ones? -- isaiah 5:4
.
"So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard: I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground. -- isaiah 5:5
.
"I will lay it waste; It will not be pruned or hoed, But briars and thorns will come up. I will also charge the clouds to rain no rain on it." -- isaiah 5:6
.
For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel And the men of Judah His delightful plant. Thus He looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; For righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress. -- isaiah 5:7
.
Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field, Until there is no more room, So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land! -- isaiah 5:8
.
In my ears the LORD of hosts has sworn, "Surely, many houses shall become desolate, Even great and fine ones, without occupants. -- isaiah 5:9
.
"For ten acres of vineyard will yield only one bath of wine, And a homer of seed will yield but an ephah of grain." -- isaiah 5:10
.
Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may pursue strong drink, Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame them! -- isaiah 5:11
.
Their banquets are accompanied by lyre and harp, by tambourine and flute, and by wine; But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the LORD, Nor do they consider the work of His hands. -- isaiah 5:12
.
Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge; And their honorable men are famished, And their multitude is parched with thirst. -- isaiah 5:13
.
Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth without measure; And Jerusalem's splendor, her multitude, her din of revelry and the jubilant within her, descend into it. -- isaiah 5:14
.
So the common man will be humbled and the man of importance abased, The eyes of the proud also will be abased. -- isaiah 5:15
.
But the LORD of hosts will be exalted in judgment, And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness. -- isaiah 5:16
.
Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, And strangers will eat in the waste places of the wealthy. -- isaiah 5:17
.
Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of falsehood, And sin as if with cart ropes; -- isaiah 5:18
.
Who say, "Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work, that we may see it; And let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near And come to pass, that we may know it!" -- isaiah 5:19
.
Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! -- isaiah 5:20
.
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes And clever in their own sight! -- isaiah 5:21
.
Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine And valiant men in mixing strong drink, -- isaiah 5:22
.
Who justify the wicked for a bribe, And take away the rights of the ones who are in the right! -- isaiah 5:23
.
Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble And dry grass collapses into the flame, So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away as dust; For they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 5:24
.
On this account the anger of the LORD has burned against His people, And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them down. And the mountains quaked, and their corpses lay like refuse in the middle of the streets. For all this His anger is not spent, But His hand is still stretched out. -- isaiah 5:25
.
He will also lift up a standard to the distant nation, And will whistle for it from the ends of the earth; And behold, it will come with speed swiftly. -- isaiah 5:26
.
No one in it is weary or stumbles, None slumbers or sleeps; Nor is the belt at its waist undone, Nor its sandal strap broken. -- isaiah 5:27
.
Its arrows are sharp and all its bows are bent; The hoofs of its horses seem like flint and its chariot wheels like a whirlwind. -- isaiah 5:28
.
Its roaring is like a lioness, and it roars like young lions; It growls as it seizes the prey And carries it off with no one to deliver it. -- isaiah 5:29
.
And it will growl over it in that day like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land, behold, there is darkness and distress; Even the light is darkened by its clouds. -- isaiah 5:30
.
In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. -- isaiah 6:1
.
Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. -- isaiah 6:2
.
And one called out to another and said, "Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory." -- isaiah 6:3
.
And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke. -- isaiah 6:4
.
Then I said, "Woe is me, for I am ruined! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I live among a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts." -- isaiah 6:5
.
Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. -- isaiah 6:6
.
He touched my mouth with it and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away and your sin is forgiven." -- isaiah 6:7
.
Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?" Then I said, "Here am I. Send me!" -- isaiah 6:8
.
He said, "Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on listening, but do not perceive; Keep on looking, but do not understand.' -- isaiah 6:9
.
"Render the hearts of this people insensitive, Their ears dull, And their eyes dim, Otherwise they might see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their hearts, And return and be healed." -- isaiah 6:10
.
Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And He answered, "Until cities are devastated and without inhabitant, Houses are without people And the land is utterly desolate, -- isaiah 6:11
.
"The LORD has removed men far away, And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. -- isaiah 6:12
.
"Yet there will be a tenth portion in it, And it will again be subject to burning, Like a terebinth or an oak Whose stump remains when it is felled. The holy seed is its stump." -- isaiah 6:13
.
Now it came about in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not conquer it. -- isaiah 7:1
.
When it was reported to the house of David, saying, "The Arameans have camped in Ephraim," his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake with the wind. -- isaiah 7:2
.
Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the fuller's field, -- isaiah 7:3
.
and say to him, 'Take care and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, on account of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah. -- isaiah 7:4
.
'Because Aram, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has planned evil against you, saying, -- isaiah 7:5
.
"Let us go up against Judah and terrorize it, and make for ourselves a breach in its walls and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it," -- isaiah 7:6
.
thus says the Lord GOD: "It shall not stand nor shall it come to pass. -- isaiah 7:7
.
"For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now within another years Ephraim will be shattered, so that it is no longer a people), -- isaiah 7:8
.
and the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, you surely shall not last."'" -- isaiah 7:9
.
Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying, -- isaiah 7:10
.
"Ask a sign for yourself from the LORD your God; make it deep as Sheol or high as heaven." -- isaiah 7:11
.
But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, nor will I test the LORD!" -- isaiah 7:12
.
Then he said, "Listen now, O house of David! Is it too slight a thing for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as well? -- isaiah 7:13
.
"Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel. -- isaiah 7:14
.
"He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows enough to refuse evil and choose good. -- isaiah 7:15
.
"For before the boy will know enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be forsaken. -- isaiah 7:16
.
"The LORD will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house such days as have never come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah, the king of Assyria." -- isaiah 7:17
.
In that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is in the remotest part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. -- isaiah 7:18
.
They will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes and on all the watering places. -- isaiah 7:19
.
In that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond the Euphrates (that is, with the king of Assyria), the head and the hair of the legs; and it will also remove the beard. -- isaiah 7:20
.
Now in that day a man may keep alive a heifer and a pair of sheep; -- isaiah 7:21
.
and because of the abundance of the milk produced he will eat curds, for everyone that is left within the land will eat curds and honey. -- isaiah 7:22
.
And it will come about in that day, that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, valued at a thousand shekels of silver, will become briars and thorns. -- isaiah 7:23
.
People will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be briars and thorns. -- isaiah 7:24
.
As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briars and thorns; but they will become a place for pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample. -- isaiah 7:25
.
Then the LORD said to me, "Take for yourself a large tablet and write on it in ordinary letters: Swift is the booty, speedy is the prey. -- isaiah 8:1
.
"And I will take to Myself faithful witnesses for testimony, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah." -- isaiah 8:2
.
So I approached the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz; -- isaiah 8:3
.
for before the boy knows how to cry out 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria." -- isaiah 8:4
.
Again the LORD spoke to me further, saying, -- isaiah 8:5
.
"Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah And rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah; -- isaiah 8:6
.
"Now therefore, behold, the Lord is about to bring on them the strong and abundant waters of the Euphrates, Even the king of Assyria and all his glory; And it will rise up over all its channels and go over all its banks. -- isaiah 8:7
.
"Then it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass through, It will reach even to the neck; And the spread of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel. -- isaiah 8:8
.
"Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered; And give ear, all remote places of the earth. Gird yourselves, yet be shattered; Gird yourselves, yet be shattered. -- isaiah 8:9
.
"Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted; State a proposal, but it will not stand, For God is with us." -- isaiah 8:10
.
For thus the LORD spoke to me with mighty power and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying, -- isaiah 8:11
.
"You are not to say, 'It is a conspiracy!' In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy, And you are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of it. -- isaiah 8:12
.
"It is the LORD of hosts whom you should regard as holy. And He shall be your fear, And He shall be your dread. -- isaiah 8:13
.
"Then He shall become a sanctuary; But to both the houses of Israel, a stone to strike and a rock to stumble over, And a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. -- isaiah 8:14
.
"Many will stumble over them, Then they will fall and be broken; They will even be snared and caught." -- isaiah 8:15
.
Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. -- isaiah 8:16
.
And I will wait for the LORD who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; I will even look eagerly for Him. -- isaiah 8:17
.
Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion. -- isaiah 8:18
.
When they say to you, "Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter," should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? -- isaiah 8:19
.
To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn. -- isaiah 8:20
.
They will pass through the land hard-pressed and famished, and it will turn out that when they are hungry, they will be enraged and curse their king and their God as they face upward. -- isaiah 8:21
.
Then they will look to the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be driven away into darkness. -- isaiah 8:22
.
But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make it glorious, by the way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. -- isaiah 9:1
.
The people who walk in darkness Will see a great light; Those who live in a dark land, The light will shine on them. -- isaiah 9:2
.
You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness; They will be glad in Your presence As with the gladness of harvest, As men rejoice when they divide the spoil. -- isaiah 9:3
.
For You shall break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders, The rod of their oppressor, as at the battle of Midian. -- isaiah 9:4
.
For every boot of the booted warrior in the battle tumult, And cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. -- isaiah 9:5
.
For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. -- isaiah 9:6
.
There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. -- isaiah 9:7
.
The Lord sends a message against Jacob, And it falls on Israel. -- isaiah 9:8
.
And all the people know it, That is, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, Asserting in pride and in arrogance of heart: -- isaiah 9:9
.
"The bricks have fallen down, But we will rebuild with smooth stones; The sycamores have been cut down, But we will replace them with cedars." -- isaiah 9:10
.
Therefore the LORD raises against them adversaries from Rezin And spurs their enemies on, -- isaiah 9:11
.
The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west; And they devour Israel with gaping jaws. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out. -- isaiah 9:12
.
Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them, Nor do they seek the LORD of hosts. -- isaiah 9:13
.
So the LORD cuts off head and tail from Israel, Both palm branch and bulrush in a single day. -- isaiah 9:14
.
The head is the elder and honorable man, And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail. -- isaiah 9:15
.
For those who guide this people are leading them astray; And those who are guided by them are brought to confusion. -- isaiah 9:16
.
Therefore the Lord does not take pleasure in their young men, Nor does He have pity on their orphans or their widows; For every one of them is godless and an evildoer, And every mouth is speaking foolishness. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out. -- isaiah 9:17
.
For wickedness burns like a fire; It consumes briars and thorns; It even sets the thickets of the forest aflame And they roll upward in a column of smoke. -- isaiah 9:18
.
By the fury of the LORD of hosts the land is burned up, And the people are like fuel for the fire; No man spares his brother. -- isaiah 9:19
.
They slice off what is on the right hand but still are hungry, And they eat what is on the left hand but they are not satisfied; Each of them eats the flesh of his own arm. -- isaiah 9:20
.
Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, And together they are against Judah. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out. -- isaiah 9:21
.
Woe to those who enact evil statutes And to those who constantly record unjust decisions, -- isaiah 10:1
.
So as to deprive the needy of justice And rob the poor of My people of their rights, So that widows may be their spoil And that they may plunder the orphans. -- isaiah 10:2
.
Now what will you do in the day of punishment, And in the devastation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your wealth? -- isaiah 10:3
.
Nothing remains but to crouch among the captives Or fall among the slain. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out. -- isaiah 10:4
.
Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger And the staff in whose hands is My indignation, -- isaiah 10:5
.
I send it against a godless nation And commission it against the people of My fury To capture booty and to seize plunder, And to trample them down like mud in the streets. -- isaiah 10:6
.
Yet it does not so intend, Nor does it plan so in its heart, But rather it is its purpose to destroy And to cut off many nations. -- isaiah 10:7
.
For it says, "Are not my princes all kings? -- isaiah 10:8
.
"Is not Calno like Carchemish, Or Hamath like Arpad, Or Samaria like Damascus? -- isaiah 10:9
.
"As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, Whose graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria, -- isaiah 10:10
.
Shall I not do to Jerusalem and her images Just as I have done to Samaria and her idols?" -- isaiah 10:11
.
So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, He will say, "I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the pomp of his haughtiness." -- isaiah 10:12
.
For he has said, "By the power of my hand and by my wisdom I did this, For I have understanding; And I removed the boundaries of the peoples And plundered their treasures, And like a mighty man I brought down their inhabitants, -- isaiah 10:13
.
And my hand reached to the riches of the peoples like a nest, And as one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth; And there was not one that flapped its wing or opened its beak or chirped." -- isaiah 10:14
.
Is the axe to boast itself over the one who chops with it? Is the saw to exalt itself over the one who wields it? That would be like a club wielding those who lift it, Or like a rod lifting him who is not wood. -- isaiah 10:15
.
Therefore the Lord, the GOD of hosts, will send a wasting disease among his stout warriors; And under his glory a fire will be kindled like a burning flame. -- isaiah 10:16
.
And the light of Israel will become a fire and his Holy One a flame, And it will burn and devour his thorns and his briars in a single day. -- isaiah 10:17
.
And He will destroy the glory of his forest and of his fruitful garden, both soul and body, And it will be as when a sick man wastes away. -- isaiah 10:18
.
And the rest of the trees of his forest will be so small in number That a child could write them down. -- isaiah 10:19
.
Now in that day the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will never again rely on the one who struck them, but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 10:20
.
A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. -- isaiah 10:21
.
For though your people, O Israel, may be like the sand of the sea, Only a remnant within them will return; A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness. -- isaiah 10:22
.
For a complete destruction, one that is decreed, the Lord GOD of hosts will execute in the midst of the whole land. -- isaiah 10:23
.
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "O My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear the Assyrian who strikes you with the rod and lifts up his staff against you, the way Egypt did. -- isaiah 10:24
.
"For in a very little while My indignation against you will be spent and My anger will be directed to their destruction." -- isaiah 10:25
.
The LORD of hosts will arouse a scourge against him like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea and He will lift it up the way He did in Egypt. -- isaiah 10:26
.
So it will be in that day, that his burden will be removed from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be broken because of fatness. -- isaiah 10:27
.
He has come against Aiath, He has passed through Migron; At Michmash he deposited his baggage. -- isaiah 10:28
.
They have gone through the pass, saying, "Geba will be our lodging place." Ramah is terrified, and Gibeah of Saul has fled away. -- isaiah 10:29
.
Cry aloud with your voice, O daughter of Gallim! Pay attention, Laishah and wretched Anathoth! -- isaiah 10:30
.
Madmenah has fled. The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge. -- isaiah 10:31
.
Yet today he will halt at Nob; He shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. -- isaiah 10:32
.
Behold, the Lord, the GOD of hosts, will lop off the boughs with a terrible crash; Those also who are tall in stature will be cut down And those who are lofty will be abased. -- isaiah 10:33
.
He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron axe, And Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One. -- isaiah 10:34
.
Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, And a branch from his roots will bear fruit. -- isaiah 11:1
.
The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD. -- isaiah 11:2
.
And He will delight in the fear of the LORD, And He will not judge by what His eyes see, Nor make a decision by what His ears hear; -- isaiah 11:3
.
But with righteousness He will judge the poor, And decide with fairness for the afflicted of the earth; And He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked. -- isaiah 11:4
.
Also righteousness will be the belt about His loins, And faithfulness the belt about His waist. -- isaiah 11:5
.
And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will lie down with the young goat, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; And a little boy will lead them. -- isaiah 11:6
.
Also the cow and the bear will graze, Their young will lie down together, And the lion will eat straw like the ox. -- isaiah 11:7
.
The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra, And the weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den. -- isaiah 11:8
.
They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea. -- isaiah 11:9
.
Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious. -- isaiah 11:10
.
Then it will happen on that day that the Lord Will again recover the second time with His hand The remnant of His people, who will remain, From Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, And from the islands of the sea. -- isaiah 11:11
.
And He will lift up a standard for the nations And assemble the banished ones of Israel, And will gather the dispersed of Judah From the four corners of the earth. -- isaiah 11:12
.
Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart, And those who harass Judah will be cut off; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, And Judah will not harass Ephraim. -- isaiah 11:13
.
They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the west; Together they will plunder the sons of the east; They will possess Edom and Moab, And the sons of Ammon will be subject to them. -- isaiah 11:14
.
And the LORD will utterly destroy The tongue of the Sea of Egypt; And He will wave His hand over the River With His scorching wind; And He will strike it into seven streams And make men walk over dry-shod. -- isaiah 11:15
.
And there will be a highway from Assyria For the remnant of His people who will be left, Just as there was for Israel In the day that they came up out of the land of Egypt. -- isaiah 11:16
.
Then you will say on that day, "I will give thanks to You, O LORD; For although You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, And You comfort me. -- isaiah 12:1
.
"Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; For the LORD GOD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation." -- isaiah 12:2
.
Therefore you will joyously draw water From the springs of salvation. -- isaiah 12:3
.
And in that day you will say, "Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name. Make known His deeds among the peoples; Make them remember that His name is exalted." -- isaiah 12:4
.
Praise the LORD in song, for He has done excellent things; Let this be known throughout the earth. -- isaiah 12:5
.
Cry aloud and shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 12:6
.
The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw. -- isaiah 13:1
.
Lift up a standard on the bare hill, Raise your voice to them, Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles. -- isaiah 13:2
.
I have commanded My consecrated ones, I have even called My mighty warriors, My proudly exulting ones, To execute My anger. -- isaiah 13:3
.
A sound of tumult on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle. -- isaiah 13:4
.
They are coming from a far country, From the farthest horizons, The LORD and His instruments of indignation, To destroy the whole land. -- isaiah 13:5
.
Wail, for the day of the LORD is near! It will come as destruction from the Almighty. -- isaiah 13:6
.
Therefore all hands will fall limp, And every man's heart will melt. -- isaiah 13:7
.
They will be terrified, Pains and anguish will take hold of them; They will writhe like a woman in labor, They will look at one another in astonishment, Their faces aflame. -- isaiah 13:8
.
Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury and burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its sinners from it. -- isaiah 13:9
.
For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises And the moon will not shed its light. -- isaiah 13:10
.
Thus I will punish the world for its evil And the wicked for their iniquity; I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud And abase the haughtiness of the ruthless. -- isaiah 13:11
.
I will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold And mankind than the gold of Ophir. -- isaiah 13:12
.
Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, And the earth will be shaken from its place At the fury of the LORD of hosts In the day of His burning anger. -- isaiah 13:13
.
And it will be that like a hunted gazelle, Or like sheep with none to gather them, They will each turn to his own people, And each one flee to his own land. -- isaiah 13:14
.
Anyone who is found will be thrust through, And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword. -- isaiah 13:15
.
Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces Before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished. -- isaiah 13:16
.
Behold, I am going to stir up the Medes against them, Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold. -- isaiah 13:17
.
And their bows will mow down the young men, They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb, Nor will their eye pity children. -- isaiah 13:18
.
And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. -- isaiah 13:19
.
It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; Nor will the Arab pitch his tent there, Nor will shepherds make their flocks lie down there. -- isaiah 13:20
.
But desert creatures will lie down there, And their houses will be full of owls; Ostriches also will live there, and shaggy goats will frolic there. -- isaiah 13:21
.
Hyenas will howl in their fortified towers And jackals in their luxurious palaces. Her fateful time also will soon come And her days will not be prolonged. -- isaiah 13:22
.
When the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and again choose Israel, and settle them in their own land, then strangers will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob. -- isaiah 14:1
.
The peoples will take them along and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the land of the LORD as male servants and female servants; and they will take their captors captive and will rule over their oppressors. -- isaiah 14:2
.
And it will be in the day when the LORD gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and harsh service in which you have been enslaved, -- isaiah 14:3
.
that you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say, "How the oppressor has ceased, And how fury has ceased! -- isaiah 14:4
.
"The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of rulers -- isaiah 14:5
.
Which used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing strokes, Which subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution. -- isaiah 14:6
.
"The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; They break forth into shouts of joy. -- isaiah 14:7
.
"Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, 'Since you were laid low, no tree cutter comes up against us.' -- isaiah 14:8
.
"Sheol from beneath is excited over you to meet you when you come; It arouses for you the spirits of the dead, all the leaders of the earth; It raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones. -- isaiah 14:9
.
"They will all respond and say to you, 'Even you have been made weak as we, You have become like us. -- isaiah 14:10
.
'Your pomp and the music of your harps Have been brought down to Sheol; Maggots are spread out as your bed beneath you And worms are your covering.' -- isaiah 14:11
.
"How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the nations! -- isaiah 14:12
.
"But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the recesses of the north. -- isaiah 14:13
.
'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' -- isaiah 14:14
.
"Nevertheless you will be thrust down to Sheol, To the recesses of the pit. -- isaiah 14:15
.
"Those who see you will gaze at you, They will ponder over you, saying, 'Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms, -- isaiah 14:16
.
Who made the world like a wilderness And overthrew its cities, Who did not allow his prisoners to go home?' -- isaiah 14:17
.
"All the kings of the nations lie in glory, Each in his own tomb. -- isaiah 14:18
.
"But you have been cast out of your tomb Like a rejected branch, Clothed with the slain who are pierced with a sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit Like a trampled corpse. -- isaiah 14:19
.
"You will not be united with them in burial, Because you have ruined your country, You have slain your people. May the offspring of evildoers not be mentioned forever. -- isaiah 14:20
.
"Prepare for his sons a place of slaughter Because of the iniquity of their fathers. They must not arise and take possession of the earth And fill the face of the world with cities." -- isaiah 14:21
.
"I will rise up against them," declares the LORD of hosts, "and will cut off from Babylon name and survivors, offspring and posterity," declares the LORD. -- isaiah 14:22
.
"I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog and swamps of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction," declares the LORD of hosts. -- isaiah 14:23
.
The LORD of hosts has sworn saying, "Surely, just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as I have planned so it will stand, -- isaiah 14:24
.
to break Assyria in My land, and I will trample him on My mountains. Then his yoke will be removed from them and his burden removed from their shoulder. -- isaiah 14:25
.
"This is the plan devised against the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations. -- isaiah 14:26
.
"For the LORD of hosts has planned, and who can frustrate it? And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it back?" -- isaiah 14:27
.
In the year that King Ahaz died this oracle came: -- isaiah 14:28
.
"Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, Because the rod that struck you is broken; For from the serpent's root a viper will come out, And its fruit will be a flying serpent. -- isaiah 14:29
.
"Those who are most helpless will eat, And the needy will lie down in security; I will destroy your root with famine, And it will kill off your survivors. -- isaiah 14:30
.
"Wail, O gate; cry, O city; Melt away, O Philistia, all of you; For smoke comes from the north, And there is no straggler in his ranks. -- isaiah 14:31
.
"How then will one answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD has founded Zion, And the afflicted of His people will seek refuge in it." -- isaiah 14:32
.
The oracle concerning Moab. Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined. -- isaiah 15:1
.
They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, even to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone's head is bald and every beard is cut off. -- isaiah 15:2
.
In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops and in their squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears. -- isaiah 15:3
.
Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul trembles within him. -- isaiah 15:4
.
My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah, For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their ruin. -- isaiah 15:5
.
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate. Surely the grass is withered, the tender grass died out, There is no green thing. -- isaiah 15:6
.
Therefore the abundance which they have acquired and stored up They carry off over the brook of Arabim. -- isaiah 15:7
.
For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab, Its wail goes as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim. -- isaiah 15:8
.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; Surely I will bring added woes upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land. -- isaiah 15:9
.
Send the tribute lamb to the ruler of the land, From Sela by way of the wilderness to the mountain of the daughter of Zion. -- isaiah 16:1
.
Then, like fleeing birds or scattered nestlings, The daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon. -- isaiah 16:2
.
"Give us advice, make a decision; Cast your shadow like night at high noon; Hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive. -- isaiah 16:3
.
"Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you; Be a hiding place to them from the destroyer." For the extortioner has come to an end, destruction has ceased, Oppressors have completely disappeared from the land. -- isaiah 16:4
.
A throne will even be established in lovingkindness, And a judge will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David; Moreover, he will seek justice And be prompt in righteousness. -- isaiah 16:5
.
We have heard of the pride of Moab, an excessive pride; Even of his arrogance, pride, and fury; His idle boasts are false. -- isaiah 16:6
.
Therefore Moab will wail; everyone of Moab will wail. You will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth As those who are utterly stricken. -- isaiah 16:7
.
For the fields of Heshbon have withered, the vines of Sibmah as well; The lords of the nations have trampled down its choice clusters Which reached as far as Jazer and wandered to the deserts; Its tendrils spread themselves out and passed over the sea. -- isaiah 16:8
.
Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah; I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; For the shouting over your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen away. -- isaiah 16:9
.
Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field; In the vineyards also there will be no cries of joy or jubilant shouting, No treader treads out wine in the presses, For I have made the shouting to cease. -- isaiah 16:10
.
Therefore my heart intones like a harp for Moab And my inward feelings for Kir-hareseth. -- isaiah 16:11
.
So it will come about when Moab presents himself, When he wearies himself upon his high place And comes to his sanctuary to pray, That he will not prevail. -- isaiah 16:12
.
This is the word which the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab. -- isaiah 16:13
.
But now the LORD speaks, saying, "Within three years, as a hired man would count them, the glory of Moab will be degraded along with all his great population, and his remnant will be very small and impotent." -- isaiah 16:14
.
The oracle concerning Damascus. "Behold, Damascus is about to be removed from being a city And will become a fallen ruin. -- isaiah 17:1
.
"The cities of Aroer are forsaken; They will be for flocks to lie down in, And there will be no one to frighten them. -- isaiah 17:2
.
"The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, And sovereignty from Damascus And the remnant of Aram; They will be like the glory of the sons of Israel," Declares the LORD of hosts. -- isaiah 17:3
.
Now in that day the glory of Jacob will fade, And the fatness of his flesh will become lean. -- isaiah 17:4
.
It will be even like the reaper gathering the standing grain, As his arm harvests the ears, Or it will be like one gleaning ears of grain In the valley of Rephaim. -- isaiah 17:5
.
Yet gleanings will be left in it like the shaking of an olive tree, Two or three olives on the topmost bough, Four or five on the branches of a fruitful tree, Declares the LORD, the God of Israel. -- isaiah 17:6
.
In that day man will have regard for his Maker And his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 17:7
.
He will not have regard for the altars, the work of his hands, Nor will he look to that which his fingers have made, Even the Asherim and incense stands. -- isaiah 17:8
.
In that day their strong cities will be like forsaken places in the forest, Or like branches which they abandoned before the sons of Israel; And the land will be a desolation. -- isaiah 17:9
.
For you have forgotten the God of your salvation And have not remembered the rock of your refuge. Therefore you plant delightful plants And set them with vine slips of a strange god. -- isaiah 17:10
.
In the day that you plant it you carefully fence it in, And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom; But the harvest will be a heap In a day of sickliness and incurable pain. -- isaiah 17:11
.
Alas, the uproar of many peoples Who roar like the roaring of the seas, And the rumbling of nations Who rush on like the rumbling of mighty waters! -- isaiah 17:12
.
The nations rumble on like the rumbling of many waters, But He will rebuke them and they will flee far away, And be chased like chaff in the mountains before the wind, Or like whirling dust before a gale. -- isaiah 17:13
.
At evening time, behold, there is terror! Before morning they are no more. Such will be the portion of those who plunder us And the lot of those who pillage us. -- isaiah 17:14
.
Alas, oh land of whirring wings Which lies beyond the rivers of Cush, -- isaiah 18:1
.
Which sends envoys by the sea, Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, To a people feared far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation Whose land the rivers divide. -- isaiah 18:2
.
All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth, As soon as a standard is raised on the mountains, you will see it, And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear it. -- isaiah 18:3
.
For thus the LORD has told me, "I will look from My dwelling place quietly Like dazzling heat in the sunshine, Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest." -- isaiah 18:4
.
For before the harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms And the flower becomes a ripening grape, Then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning knives And remove and cut away the spreading branches. -- isaiah 18:5
.
They will be left together for mountain birds of prey, And for the beasts of the earth; And the birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them, And all the beasts of the earth will spend harvest time on them. -- isaiah 18:6
.
At that time a gift of homage will be brought to the LORD of hosts From a people tall and smooth, Even from a people feared far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation, Whose land the rivers divide-- To the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, even Mount Zion. -- isaiah 18:7
.
The oracle concerning Egypt. Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and is about to come to Egypt; The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them. -- isaiah 19:1
.
"So I will incite Egyptians against Egyptians; And they will each fight against his brother and each against his neighbor, City against city and kingdom against kingdom. -- isaiah 19:2
.
"Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be demoralized within them; And I will confound their strategy, So that they will resort to idols and ghosts of the dead And to mediums and spiritists. -- isaiah 19:3
.
"Moreover, I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master, And a mighty king will rule over them," declares the Lord GOD of hosts. -- isaiah 19:4
.
The waters from the sea will dry up, And the river will be parched and dry. -- isaiah 19:5
.
The canals will emit a stench, The streams of Egypt will thin out and dry up; The reeds and rushes will rot away. -- isaiah 19:6
.
The bulrushes by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile And all the sown fields by the Nile Will become dry, be driven away, and be no more. -- isaiah 19:7
.
And the fishermen will lament, And all those who cast a line into the Nile will mourn, And those who spread nets on the waters will pine away. -- isaiah 19:8
.
Moreover, the manufacturers of linen made from combed flax And the weavers of white cloth will be utterly dejected. -- isaiah 19:9
.
And the pillars of Egypt will be crushed; All the hired laborers will be grieved in soul. -- isaiah 19:10
.
The princes of Zoan are mere fools; The advice of Pharaoh's wisest advisers has become stupid. How can you men say to Pharaoh, "I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings"? -- isaiah 19:11
.
Well then, where are your wise men? Please let them tell you, And let them understand what the LORD of hosts Has purposed against Egypt. -- isaiah 19:12
.
The princes of Zoan have acted foolishly, The princes of Memphis are deluded; Those who are the cornerstone of her tribes Have led Egypt astray. -- isaiah 19:13
.
The LORD has mixed within her a spirit of distortion; They have led Egypt astray in all that it does, As a drunken man staggers in his vomit. -- isaiah 19:14
.
There will be no work for Egypt Which its head or tail, its palm branch or bulrush, may do. -- isaiah 19:15
.
In that day the Egyptians will become like women, and they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He is going to wave over them. -- isaiah 19:16
.
The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt; everyone to whom it is mentioned will be in dread of it, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts which He is purposing against them. -- isaiah 19:17
.
In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing allegiance to the LORD of hosts; one will be called the City of Destruction. -- isaiah 19:18
.
In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD near its border. -- isaiah 19:19
.
It will become a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a Champion, and He will deliver them. -- isaiah 19:20
.
Thus the LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day. They will even worship with sacrifice and offering, and will make a vow to the LORD and perform it. -- isaiah 19:21
.
The LORD will strike Egypt, striking but healing; so they will return to the LORD, and He will respond to them and will heal them. -- isaiah 19:22
.
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. -- isaiah 19:23
.
In that day Israel will be the third party with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, -- isaiah 19:24
.
whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance." -- isaiah 19:25
.
In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it, -- isaiah 20:1
.
at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go and loosen the sackcloth from your hips and take your shoes off your feet." And he did so, going naked and barefoot. -- isaiah 20:2
.
And the LORD said, "Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token against Egypt and Cush, -- isaiah 20:3
.
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. -- isaiah 20:4
.
"Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast. -- isaiah 20:5
.
"So the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, 'Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and we, how shall we escape?'" -- isaiah 20:6
.
The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea. As windstorms in the Negev sweep on, It comes from the wilderness, from a terrifying land. -- isaiah 21:1
.
A harsh vision has been shown to me; The treacherous one still deals treacherously, and the destroyer still destroys. Go up, Elam, lay siege, Media; I have made an end of all the groaning she has caused. -- isaiah 21:2
.
For this reason my loins are full of anguish; Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labor. I am so bewildered I cannot hear, so terrified I cannot see. -- isaiah 21:3
.
My mind reels, horror overwhelms me; The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling. -- isaiah 21:4
.
They set the table, they spread out the cloth, they eat, they drink; "Rise up, captains, oil the shields," -- isaiah 21:5
.
For thus the Lord says to me, "Go, station the lookout, let him report what he sees. -- isaiah 21:6
.
"When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, A train of donkeys, a train of camels, Let him pay close attention, very close attention." -- isaiah 21:7
.
Then the lookout called, "O Lord, I stand continually by day on the watchtower, And I am stationed every night at my guard post. -- isaiah 21:8
.
"Now behold, here comes a troop of riders, horsemen in pairs." And one said, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; And all the images of her gods are shattered on the ground." -- isaiah 21:9
.
O my threshed people, and my afflicted of the threshing floor! What I have heard from the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, I make known to you. -- isaiah 21:10
.
The oracle concerning Edom. One keeps calling to me from Seir, "Watchman, how far gone is the night? Watchman, how far gone is the night?" -- isaiah 21:11
.
The watchman says, "Morning comes but also night. If you would inquire, inquire; Come back again." -- isaiah 21:12
.
The oracle about Arabia. In the thickets of Arabia you must spend the night, O caravans of Dedanites. -- isaiah 21:13
.
Bring water for the thirsty, O inhabitants of the land of Tema, Meet the fugitive with bread. -- isaiah 21:14
.
For they have fled from the swords, From the drawn sword, and from the bent bow And from the press of battle. -- isaiah 21:15
.
For thus the Lord said to me, "In a year, as a hired man would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will terminate; -- isaiah 21:16
.
and the remainder of the number of bowmen, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for the LORD God of Israel has spoken." -- isaiah 21:17
.
The oracle concerning the valley of vision. What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops? -- isaiah 22:1
.
You who were full of noise, You boisterous town, you exultant city; Your slain were not slain with the sword, Nor did they die in battle. -- isaiah 22:2
.
All your rulers have fled together, And have been captured without the bow; All of you who were found were taken captive together, Though they had fled far away. -- isaiah 22:3
.
Therefore I say, "Turn your eyes away from me, Let me weep bitterly, Do not try to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people." -- isaiah 22:4
.
For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day of panic, subjugation and confusion In the valley of vision, A breaking down of walls And a crying to the mountain. -- isaiah 22:5
.
Elam took up the quiver With the chariots, infantry and horsemen; And Kir uncovered the shield. -- isaiah 22:6
.
Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots, And the horsemen took up fixed positions at the gate. -- isaiah 22:7
.
And He removed the defense of Judah. In that day you depended on the weapons of the house of the forest, -- isaiah 22:8
.
And you saw that the breaches In the wall of the city of David were many; And you collected the waters of the lower pool. -- isaiah 22:9
.
Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem And tore down houses to fortify the wall. -- isaiah 22:10
.
And you made a reservoir between the two walls For the waters of the old pool. But you did not depend on Him who made it, Nor did you take into consideration Him who planned it long ago. -- isaiah 22:11
.
Therefore in that day the Lord GOD of hosts called you to weeping, to wailing, To shaving the head and to wearing sackcloth. -- isaiah 22:12
.
Instead, there is gaiety and gladness, Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, Eating of meat and drinking of wine: "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die." -- isaiah 22:13
.
But the LORD of hosts revealed Himself to me, "Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you Until you die," says the Lord GOD of hosts. -- isaiah 22:14
.
Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "Come, go to this steward, To Shebna, who is in charge of the royal household, -- isaiah 22:15
.
'What right do you have here, And whom do you have here, That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, You who hew a tomb on the height, You who carve a resting place for yourself in the rock? -- isaiah 22:16
.
'Behold, the LORD is about to hurl you headlong, O man. And He is about to grasp you firmly -- isaiah 22:17
.
And roll you tightly like a ball, To be cast into a vast country; There you will die And there your splendid chariots will be, You shame of your master's house.' -- isaiah 22:18
.
"I will depose you from your office, And I will pull you down from your station. -- isaiah 22:19
.
"Then it will come about in that day, That I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, -- isaiah 22:20
.
And I will clothe him with your tunic And tie your sash securely about him. I will entrust him with your authority, And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. -- isaiah 22:21
.
"Then I will set the key of the house of David on his shoulder, When he opens no one will shut, When he shuts no one will open. -- isaiah 22:22
.
"I will drive him like a peg in a firm place, And he will become a throne of glory to his father's house. -- isaiah 22:23
.
"So they will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, offspring and issue, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars. -- isaiah 22:24
.
"In that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "the peg driven in a firm place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken." -- isaiah 22:25
.
The oracle concerning Tyre. Wail, O ships of Tarshish, For Tyre is destroyed, without house or harbor; It is reported to them from the land of Cyprus. -- isaiah 23:1
.
Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland, You merchants of Sidon; Your messengers crossed the sea -- isaiah 23:2
.
And were on many waters. The grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River was her revenue; And she was the market of nations. -- isaiah 23:3
.
Be ashamed, O Sidon; For the sea speaks, the stronghold of the sea, saying, "I have neither travailed nor given birth, I have neither brought up young men nor reared virgins." -- isaiah 23:4
.
When the report reaches Egypt, They will be in anguish at the report of Tyre. -- isaiah 23:5
.
Pass over to Tarshish; Wail, O inhabitants of the coastland. -- isaiah 23:6
.
Is this your jubilant city, Whose origin is from antiquity, Whose feet used to carry her to colonize distant places? -- isaiah 23:7
.
Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, Whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth? -- isaiah 23:8
.
The LORD of hosts has planned it, to defile the pride of all beauty, To despise all the honored of the earth. -- isaiah 23:9
.
Overflow your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish, There is no more restraint. -- isaiah 23:10
.
He has stretched His hand out over the sea, He has made the kingdoms tremble; The LORD has given a command concerning Canaan to demolish its strongholds. -- isaiah 23:11
.
He has said, "You shall exult no more, O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest." -- isaiah 23:12
.
Behold, the land of the Chaldeans--this is the people which was not; Assyria appointed it for desert creatures--they erected their siege towers, they stripped its palaces, they made it a ruin. -- isaiah 23:13
.
Wail, O ships of Tarshish, For your stronghold is destroyed. -- isaiah 23:14
.
Now in that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot: -- isaiah 23:15
.
Take your harp, walk about the city, O forgotten harlot; Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs, That you may be remembered. -- isaiah 23:16
.
It will come about at the end of seventy years that the LORD will visit Tyre. Then she will go back to her harlot's wages and will play the harlot with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. -- isaiah 23:17
.
Her gain and her harlot's wages will be set apart to the LORD; it will not be stored up or hoarded, but her gain will become sufficient food and choice attire for those who dwell in the presence of the LORD. -- isaiah 23:18
.
Behold, the LORD lays the earth waste, devastates it, distorts its surface and scatters its inhabitants. -- isaiah 24:1
.
And the people will be like the priest, the servant like his master, the maid like her mistress, the buyer like the seller, the lender like the borrower, the creditor like the debtor. -- isaiah 24:2
.
The earth will be completely laid waste and completely despoiled, for the LORD has spoken this word. -- isaiah 24:3
.
The earth mourns and withers, the world fades and withers, the exalted of the people of the earth fade away. -- isaiah 24:4
.
The earth is also polluted by its inhabitants, for they transgressed laws, violated statutes, broke the everlasting covenant. -- isaiah 24:5
.
Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who live in it are held guilty. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left. -- isaiah 24:6
.
The new wine mourns, The vine decays, All the merry-hearted sigh. -- isaiah 24:7
.
The gaiety of tambourines ceases, The noise of revelers stops, The gaiety of the harp ceases. -- isaiah 24:8
.
They do not drink wine with song; Strong drink is bitter to those who drink it. -- isaiah 24:9
.
The city of chaos is broken down; Every house is shut up so that none may enter. -- isaiah 24:10
.
There is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine; All joy turns to gloom. The gaiety of the earth is banished. -- isaiah 24:11
.
Desolation is left in the city And the gate is battered to ruins. -- isaiah 24:12
.
For thus it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, As the shaking of an olive tree, As the gleanings when the grape harvest is over. -- isaiah 24:13
.
They raise their voices, they shout for joy; They cry out from the west concerning the majesty of the LORD. -- isaiah 24:14
.
Therefore glorify the LORD in the east, The name of the LORD, the God of Israel, In the coastlands of the sea. -- isaiah 24:15
.
From the ends of the earth we hear songs, "Glory to the Righteous One," But I say, "Woe to me! Woe to me! Alas for me! The treacherous deal treacherously, And the treacherous deal very treacherously." -- isaiah 24:16
.
Terror and pit and snare Confront you, O inhabitant of the earth. -- isaiah 24:17
.
Then it will be that he who flees the report of disaster will fall into the pit, And he who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare; For the windows above are opened, and the foundations of the earth shake. -- isaiah 24:18
.
The earth is broken asunder, The earth is split through, The earth is shaken violently. -- isaiah 24:19
.
The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard And it totters like a shack, For its transgression is heavy upon it, And it will fall, never to rise again. -- isaiah 24:20
.
So it will happen in that day, That the LORD will punish the host of heaven on high, And the kings of the earth on earth. -- isaiah 24:21
.
They will be gathered together Like prisoners in the dungeon, And will be confined in prison; And after many days they will be punished. -- isaiah 24:22
.
Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed, For the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, And His glory will be before His elders. -- isaiah 24:23
.
O LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name; For You have worked wonders, Plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness. -- isaiah 25:1
.
For You have made a city into a heap, A fortified city into a ruin; A palace of strangers is a city no more, It will never be rebuilt. -- isaiah 25:2
.
Therefore a strong people will glorify You; Cities of ruthless nations will revere You. -- isaiah 25:3
.
For You have been a defense for the helpless, A defense for the needy in his distress, A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat; For the breath of the ruthless Is like a rain storm against a wall. -- isaiah 25:4
.
Like heat in drought, You subdue the uproar of aliens; Like heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced. -- isaiah 25:5
.
The LORD of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain; A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow, And refined, aged wine. -- isaiah 25:6
.
And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples, Even the veil which is stretched over all nations. -- isaiah 25:7
.
He will swallow up death for all time, And the Lord GOD will wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth; For the LORD has spoken. -- isaiah 25:8
.
And it will be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation." -- isaiah 25:9
.
For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, And Moab will be trodden down in his place As straw is trodden down in the water of a manure pile. -- isaiah 25:10
.
And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it As a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim, But the Lord will lay low his pride together with the trickery of his hands. -- isaiah 25:11
.
The unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down, Lay low and cast to the ground, even to the dust. -- isaiah 25:12
.
In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; He sets up walls and ramparts for security. -- isaiah 26:1
.
"Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, The one that remains faithful. -- isaiah 26:2
.
"The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, Because he trusts in You. -- isaiah 26:3
.
"Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD, we have an everlasting Rock. -- isaiah 26:4
.
"For He has brought low those who dwell on high, the unassailable city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He casts it to the dust. -- isaiah 26:5
.
"The foot will trample it, The feet of the afflicted, the steps of the helpless." -- isaiah 26:6
.
The way of the righteous is smooth; O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level. -- isaiah 26:7
.
Indeed, while following the way of Your judgments, O LORD, We have waited for You eagerly; Your name, even Your memory, is the desire of our souls. -- isaiah 26:8
.
At night my soul longs for You, Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently; For when the earth experiences Your judgments The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. -- isaiah 26:9
.
Though the wicked is shown favor, He does not learn righteousness; He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness, And does not perceive the majesty of the LORD. -- isaiah 26:10
.
O LORD, Your hand is lifted up yet they do not see it. They see Your zeal for the people and are put to shame; Indeed, fire will devour Your enemies. -- isaiah 26:11
.
LORD, You will establish peace for us, Since You have also performed for us all our works. -- isaiah 26:12
.
O LORD our God, other masters besides You have ruled us; But through You alone we confess Your name. -- isaiah 26:13
.
The dead will not live, the departed spirits will not rise; Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, And You have wiped out all remembrance of them. -- isaiah 26:14
.
You have increased the nation, O LORD, You have increased the nation, You are glorified; You have extended all the borders of the land. -- isaiah 26:15
.
O LORD, they sought You in distress; They could only whisper a prayer, Your chastening was upon them. -- isaiah 26:16
.
As the pregnant woman approaches the time to give birth, She writhes and cries out in her labor pains, Thus were we before You, O LORD. -- isaiah 26:17
.
We were pregnant, we writhed in labor, We gave birth, as it seems, only to wind. We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth, Nor were inhabitants of the world born. -- isaiah 26:18
.
Your dead will live; Their corpses will rise. You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, For your dew is as the dew of the dawn, And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits. -- isaiah 26:19
.
Come, my people, enter into your rooms And close your doors behind you; Hide for a little while Until indignation runs its course. -- isaiah 26:20
.
For behold, the LORD is about to come out from His place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; And the earth will reveal her bloodshed And will no longer cover her slain. -- isaiah 26:21
.
In that day the LORD will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, With His fierce and great and mighty sword, Even Leviathan the twisted serpent; And He will kill the dragon who lives in the sea. -- isaiah 27:1
.
In that day, "A vineyard of wine, sing of it! -- isaiah 27:2
.
"I, the LORD, am its keeper; I water it every moment. So that no one will damage it, I guard it night and day. -- isaiah 27:3
.
"I have no wrath. Should someone give Me briars and thorns in battle, Then I would step on them, I would burn them completely. -- isaiah 27:4
.
"Or let him rely on My protection, Let him make peace with Me, Let him make peace with Me." -- isaiah 27:5
.
In the days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and sprout, And they will fill the whole world with fruit. -- isaiah 27:6
.
Like the striking of Him who has struck them, has He struck them? Or like the slaughter of His slain, have they been slain? -- isaiah 27:7
.
You contended with them by banishing them, by driving them away. With His fierce wind He has expelled them on the day of the east wind. -- isaiah 27:8
.
Therefore through this Jacob's iniquity will be forgiven; And this will be the full price of the pardoning of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones like pulverized chalk stones; When Asherim and incense altars will not stand. -- isaiah 27:9
.
For the fortified city is isolated, A homestead forlorn and forsaken like the desert; There the calf will graze, And there it will lie down and feed on its branches. -- isaiah 27:10
.
When its limbs are dry, they are broken off; Women come and make a fire with them, For they are not a people of discernment, Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them. And their Creator will not be gracious to them. -- isaiah 27:11
.
In that day the LORD will start His threshing from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered up one by one, O sons of Israel. -- isaiah 27:12
.
It will come about also in that day that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were perishing in the land of Assyria and who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem. -- isaiah 27:13
.
Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fertile valley Of those who are overcome with wine! -- isaiah 28:1
.
Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty agent; As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction, Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters, He has cast it down to the earth with His hand. -- isaiah 28:2
.
The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden under foot. -- isaiah 28:3
.
And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fertile valley, Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer, Which one sees, And as soon as it is in his hand, He swallows it. -- isaiah 28:4
.
In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people; -- isaiah 28:5
.
A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, A strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate. -- isaiah 28:6
.
And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink: The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, They are confused by wine, they stagger from strong drink; They reel while having visions, They totter when rendering judgment. -- isaiah 28:7
.
For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a single clean place. -- isaiah 28:8
.
"To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would He interpret the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the breast? -- isaiah 28:9
.
"For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'" -- isaiah 28:10
.
Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue, -- isaiah 28:11
.
He who said to them, "Here is rest, give rest to the weary," And, "Here is repose," but they would not listen. -- isaiah 28:12
.
So the word of the LORD to them will be, "Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there," That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken captive. -- isaiah 28:13
.
Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers, Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem, -- isaiah 28:14
.
Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, And with Sheol we have made a pact. The overwhelming scourge will not reach us when it passes by, For we have made falsehood our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with deception." -- isaiah 28:15
.
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone, A costly cornerstone for the foundation, firmly placed. He who believes in it will not be disturbed. -- isaiah 28:16
.
"I will make justice the measuring line And righteousness the level; Then hail will sweep away the refuge of lies And the waters will overflow the secret place. -- isaiah 28:17
.
"Your covenant with death will be canceled, And your pact with Sheol will not stand; When the overwhelming scourge passes through, Then you become its trampling place. -- isaiah 28:18
.
"As often as it passes through, it will seize you; For morning after morning it will pass through, anytime during the day or night, And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means." -- isaiah 28:19
.
The bed is too short on which to stretch out, And the blanket is too small to wrap oneself in. -- isaiah 28:20
.
For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim, He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon, To do His task, His unusual task, And to work His work, His extraordinary work. -- isaiah 28:21
.
And now do not carry on as scoffers, Or your fetters will be made stronger; For I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts Of decisive destruction on all the earth. -- isaiah 28:22
.
Give ear and hear my voice, Listen and hear my words. -- isaiah 28:23
.
Does the farmer plow continually to plant seed? Does he continually turn and harrow the ground? -- isaiah 28:24
.
Does he not level its surface And sow dill and scatter cummin And plant wheat in rows, Barley in its place and rye within its area? -- isaiah 28:25
.
For his God instructs and teaches him properly. -- isaiah 28:26
.
For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, Nor is the cartwheel driven over cummin; But dill is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a club. -- isaiah 28:27
.
Grain for bread is crushed, Indeed, he does not continue to thresh it forever. Because the wheel of his cart and his horses eventually damage it, He does not thresh it longer. -- isaiah 28:28
.
This also comes from the LORD of hosts, Who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great. -- isaiah 28:29
.
Woe, O Ariel, Ariel the city where David once camped! Add year to year, observe your feasts on schedule. -- isaiah 29:1
.
I will bring distress to Ariel, And she will be a city of lamenting and mourning; And she will be like an Ariel to me. -- isaiah 29:2
.
I will camp against you encircling you, And I will set siegeworks against you, And I will raise up battle towers against you. -- isaiah 29:3
.
Then you will be brought low; From the earth you will speak, And from the dust where you are prostrate Your words will come. Your voice will also be like that of a spirit from the ground, And your speech will whisper from the dust. -- isaiah 29:4
.
But the multitude of your enemies will become like fine dust, And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which blows away; And it will happen instantly, suddenly. -- isaiah 29:5
.
From the LORD of hosts you will be punished with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, With whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire. -- isaiah 29:6
.
And the multitude of all the nations who wage war against Ariel, Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, Will be like a dream, a vision of the night. -- isaiah 29:7
.
It will be as when a hungry man dreams-- And behold, he is eating; But when he awakens, his hunger is not satisfied, Or as when a thirsty man dreams-- And behold, he is drinking, But when he awakens, behold, he is faint And his thirst is not quenched. Thus the multitude of all the nations will be Who wage war against Mount Zion. -- isaiah 29:8
.
Be delayed and wait, Blind yourselves and be blind; They become drunk, but not with wine, They stagger, but not with strong drink. -- isaiah 29:9
.
For the LORD has poured over you a spirit of deep sleep, He has shut your eyes, the prophets; And He has covered your heads, the seers. -- isaiah 29:10
.
The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book, which when they give it to the one who is literate, saying, "Please read this," he will say, "I cannot, for it is sealed." -- isaiah 29:11
.
Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, "Please read this." And he will say, "I cannot read." -- isaiah 29:12
.
Then the Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote, -- isaiah 29:13
.
Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed." -- isaiah 29:14
.
Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?" -- isaiah 29:15
.
You turn things around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"? -- isaiah 29:16
.
Is it not yet just a little while Before Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field, And the fertile field will be considered as a forest? -- isaiah 29:17
.
On that day the deaf will hear words of a book, And out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. -- isaiah 29:18
.
The afflicted also will increase their gladness in the LORD, And the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 29:19
.
For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished, Indeed all who are intent on doing evil will be cut off; -- isaiah 29:20
.
Who cause a person to be indicted by a word, And ensnare him who adjudicates at the gate, And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments. -- isaiah 29:21
.
Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: "Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now turn pale; -- isaiah 29:22
.
But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, They will sanctify My name; Indeed, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob And will stand in awe of the God of Israel. -- isaiah 29:23
.
"Those who err in mind will know the truth, And those who criticize will accept instruction. -- isaiah 29:24
.
"Woe to the rebellious children," declares the LORD, "Who execute a plan, but not Mine, And make an alliance, but not of My Spirit, In order to add sin to sin; -- isaiah 30:1
.
Who proceed down to Egypt Without consulting Me, To take refuge in the safety of Pharaoh And to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt! -- isaiah 30:2
.
"Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation. -- isaiah 30:3
.
"For their princes are at Zoan And their ambassadors arrive at Hanes. -- isaiah 30:4
.
"Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them, Who are not for help or profit, but for shame and also for reproach." -- isaiah 30:5
.
The oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev. Through a land of distress and anguish, From where come lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent, They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys And their treasures on camels' humps, To a people who cannot profit them; -- isaiah 30:6
.
Even Egypt, whose help is vain and empty. Therefore, I have called her "Rahab who has been exterminated." -- isaiah 30:7
.
Now go, write it on a tablet before them And inscribe it on a scroll, That it may serve in the time to come As a witness forever. -- isaiah 30:8
.
For this is a rebellious people, false sons, Sons who refuse to listen To the instruction of the LORD; -- isaiah 30:9
.
Who say to the seers, "You must not see visions"; And to the prophets, "You must not prophesy to us what is right, Speak to us pleasant words, Prophesy illusions. -- isaiah 30:10
.
"Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, Let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel." -- isaiah 30:11
.
Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Since you have rejected this word And have put your trust in oppression and guile, and have relied on them, -- isaiah 30:12
.
Therefore this iniquity will be to you Like a breach about to fall, A bulge in a high wall, Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant, -- isaiah 30:13
.
Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter's jar, So ruthlessly shattered That a sherd will not be found among its pieces To take fire from a hearth Or to scoop water from a cistern." -- isaiah 30:14
.
For thus the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said, "In repentance and rest you will be saved, In quietness and trust is your strength." But you were not willing, -- isaiah 30:15
.
And you said, "No, for we will flee on horses," Therefore you shall flee! "And we will ride on swift horses," Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift. -- isaiah 30:16
.
One thousand will flee at the threat of one man; You will flee at the threat of five, Until you are left as a flag on a mountain top And as a signal on a hill. -- isaiah 30:17
.
Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice; How blessed are all those who long for Him. -- isaiah 30:18
.
O people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you. -- isaiah 30:19
.
Although the Lord has given you bread of privation and water of oppression, He, your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will behold your Teacher. -- isaiah 30:20
.
Your ears will hear a word behind you, "This is the way, walk in it," whenever you turn to the right or to the left. -- isaiah 30:21
.
And you will defile your graven images overlaid with silver, and your molten images plated with gold. You will scatter them as an impure thing, and say to them, "Be gone!" -- isaiah 30:22
.
Then He will give you rain for the seed which you will sow in the ground, and bread from the yield of the ground, and it will be rich and plenteous; on that day your livestock will graze in a roomy pasture. -- isaiah 30:23
.
Also the oxen and the donkeys which work the ground will eat salted fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork. -- isaiah 30:24
.
On every lofty mountain and on every high hill there will be streams running with water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. -- isaiah 30:25
.
The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, on the day the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He has inflicted. -- isaiah 30:26
.
Behold, the name of the LORD comes from a remote place; Burning is His anger and dense is His smoke; His lips are filled with indignation And His tongue is like a consuming fire; -- isaiah 30:27
.
His breath is like an overflowing torrent, Which reaches to the neck, To shake the nations back and forth in a sieve, And to put in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads to ruin. -- isaiah 30:28
.
You will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival, And gladness of heart as when one marches to the sound of the flute, To go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. -- isaiah 30:29
.
And the LORD will cause His voice of authority to be heard, And the descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger, And in the flame of a consuming fire In cloudburst, downpour and hailstones. -- isaiah 30:30
.
For at the voice of the LORD Assyria will be terrified, When He strikes with the rod. -- isaiah 30:31
.
And every blow of the rod of punishment, Which the LORD will lay on him, Will be with the music of tambourines and lyres; And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight them. -- isaiah 30:32
.
For Topheth has long been ready, Indeed, it has been prepared for the king. He has made it deep and large, A pyre of fire with plenty of wood; The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire. -- isaiah 30:33
.
Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help And rely on horses, And trust in chariots because they are many And in horsemen because they are very strong, But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the LORD! -- isaiah 31:1
.
Yet He also is wise and will bring disaster And does not retract His words, But will arise against the house of evildoers And against the help of the workers of iniquity. -- isaiah 31:2
.
Now the Egyptians are men and not God, And their horses are flesh and not spirit; So the LORD will stretch out His hand, And he who helps will stumble And he who is helped will fall, And all of them will come to an end together. -- isaiah 31:3
.
For thus says the LORD to me, "As the lion or the young lion growls over his prey, Against which a band of shepherds is called out, And he will not be terrified at their voice nor disturbed at their noise, So will the LORD of hosts come down to wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill." -- isaiah 31:4
.
Like flying birds so the LORD of hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it; He will pass over and rescue it. -- isaiah 31:5
.
Return to Him from whom you have deeply defected, O sons of Israel. -- isaiah 31:6
.
For in that day every man will cast away his silver idols and his gold idols, which your sinful hands have made for you as a sin. -- isaiah 31:7
.
And the Assyrian will fall by a sword not of man, And a sword not of man will devour him. So he will not escape the sword, And his young men will become forced laborers. -- isaiah 31:8
.
"His rock will pass away because of panic, And his princes will be terrified at the standard," Declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem. -- isaiah 31:9
.
Behold, a king will reign righteously And princes will rule justly. -- isaiah 32:1
.
Each will be like a refuge from the wind And a shelter from the storm, Like streams of water in a dry country, Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land. -- isaiah 32:2
.
Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded, And the ears of those who hear will listen. -- isaiah 32:3
.
The mind of the hasty will discern the truth, And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly. -- isaiah 32:4
.
No longer will the fool be called noble, Or the rogue be spoken of as generous. -- isaiah 32:5
.
For a fool speaks nonsense, And his heart inclines toward wickedness: To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the LORD, To keep the hungry person unsatisfied And to withhold drink from the thirsty. -- isaiah 32:6
.
As for a rogue, his weapons are evil; He devises wicked schemes To destroy the afflicted with slander, Even though the needy one speaks what is right. -- isaiah 32:7
.
But the noble man devises noble plans; And by noble plans he stands. -- isaiah 32:8
.
Rise up, you women who are at ease, And hear my voice; Give ear to my word, You complacent daughters. -- isaiah 32:9
.
Within a year and a few days You will be troubled, O complacent daughters; For the vintage is ended, And the fruit gathering will not come. -- isaiah 32:10
.
Tremble, you women who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent daughters; Strip, undress and put sackcloth on your waist, -- isaiah 32:11
.
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine, -- isaiah 32:12
.
For the land of my people in which thorns and briars shall come up; Yea, for all the joyful houses and for the jubilant city. -- isaiah 32:13
.
Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken. Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever, A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks; -- isaiah 32:14
.
Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fertile field, And the fertile field is considered as a forest. -- isaiah 32:15
.
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness And righteousness will abide in the fertile field. -- isaiah 32:16
.
And the work of righteousness will be peace, And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever. -- isaiah 32:17
.
Then my people will live in a peaceful habitation, And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places; -- isaiah 32:18
.
And it will hail when the forest comes down, And the city will be utterly laid low. -- isaiah 32:19
.
How blessed will you be, you who sow beside all waters, Who let out freely the ox and the donkey. -- isaiah 32:20
.
Woe to you, O destroyer, While you were not destroyed; And he who is treacherous, while others did not deal treacherously with him. As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed; As soon as you cease to deal treacherously, others will deal treacherously with you. -- isaiah 33:1
.
O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be their strength every morning, Our salvation also in the time of distress. -- isaiah 33:2
.
At the sound of the tumult peoples flee; At the lifting up of Yourself nations disperse. -- isaiah 33:3
.
Your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; As locusts rushing about men rush about on it. -- isaiah 33:4
.
The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. -- isaiah 33:5
.
And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure. -- isaiah 33:6
.
Behold, their brave men cry in the streets, The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. -- isaiah 33:7
.
The highways are desolate, the traveler has ceased, He has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, He has no regard for man. -- isaiah 33:8
.
The land mourns and pines away, Lebanon is shamed and withers; Sharon is like a desert plain, And Bashan and Carmel lose their foliage. -- isaiah 33:9
.
"Now I will arise," says the LORD, "Now I will be exalted, now I will be lifted up. -- isaiah 33:10
.
"You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble; My breath will consume you like a fire. -- isaiah 33:11
.
"The peoples will be burned to lime, Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire. -- isaiah 33:12
.
"You who are far away, hear what I have done; And you who are near, acknowledge My might." -- isaiah 33:13
.
Sinners in Zion are terrified; Trembling has seized the godless. "Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with continual burning?" -- isaiah 33:14
.
He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity, He who rejects unjust gain And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe; He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil; -- isaiah 33:15
.
He will dwell on the heights, His refuge will be the impregnable rock; His bread will be given him, His water will be sure. -- isaiah 33:16
.
Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will behold a far-distant land. -- isaiah 33:17
.
Your heart will meditate on terror: "Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?" -- isaiah 33:18
.
You will no longer see a fierce people, A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends, Of a stammering tongue which no one understands. -- isaiah 33:19
.
Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an undisturbed habitation, A tent which will not be folded; Its stakes will never be pulled up, Nor any of its cords be torn apart. -- isaiah 33:20
.
But there the majestic One, the LORD, will be for us A place of rivers and wide canals On which no boat with oars will go, And on which no mighty ship will pass-- -- isaiah 33:21
.
For the LORD is our judge, The LORD is our lawgiver, The LORD is our king; He will save us-- -- isaiah 33:22
.
Your tackle hangs slack; It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided; The lame will take the plunder. -- isaiah 33:23
.
And no resident will say, "I am sick"; The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity. -- isaiah 33:24
.
Draw near, O nations, to hear; and listen, O peoples! Let the earth and all it contains hear, and the world and all that springs from it. -- isaiah 34:1
.
For the LORD'S indignation is against all the nations, And His wrath against all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them, He has given them over to slaughter. -- isaiah 34:2
.
So their slain will be thrown out, And their corpses will give off their stench, And the mountains will be drenched with their blood. -- isaiah 34:3
.
And all the host of heaven will wear away, And the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; All their hosts will also wither away As a leaf withers from the vine, Or as one withers from the fig tree. -- isaiah 34:4
.
For My sword is satiated in heaven, Behold it shall descend for judgment upon Edom And upon the people whom I have devoted to destruction. -- isaiah 34:5
.
The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, It is sated with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah And a great slaughter in the land of Edom. -- isaiah 34:6
.
Wild oxen will also fall with them And young bulls with strong ones; Thus their land will be soaked with blood, And their dust become greasy with fat. -- isaiah 34:7
.
For the LORD has a day of vengeance, A year of recompense for the cause of Zion. -- isaiah 34:8
.
Its streams will be turned into pitch, And its loose earth into brimstone, And its land will become burning pitch. -- isaiah 34:9
.
It will not be quenched night or day; Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will be desolate; None will pass through it forever and ever. -- isaiah 34:10
.
But pelican and hedgehog will possess it, And owl and raven will dwell in it; And He will stretch over it the line of desolation And the plumb line of emptiness. -- isaiah 34:11
.
Its nobles--there is no one there Whom they may proclaim king-- And all its princes will be nothing. -- isaiah 34:12
.
Thorns will come up in its fortified towers, Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities; It will also be a haunt of jackals And an abode of ostriches. -- isaiah 34:13
.
The desert creatures will meet with the wolves, The hairy goat also will cry to its kind; Yes, the night monster will settle there And will find herself a resting place. -- isaiah 34:14
.
The tree snake will make its nest and lay eggs there, And it will hatch and gather them under its protection. Yes, the hawks will be gathered there, Every one with its kind. -- isaiah 34:15
.
Seek from the book of the LORD, and read: Not one of these will be missing; None will lack its mate. For His mouth has commanded, And His Spirit has gathered them. -- isaiah 34:16
.
He has cast the lot for them, And His hand has divided it to them by line. They shall possess it forever; From generation to generation they will dwell in it. -- isaiah 34:17
.
The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the Arabah will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus -- isaiah 35:1
.
It will blossom profusely And rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty of our God. -- isaiah 35:2
.
Encourage the exhausted, and strengthen the feeble. -- isaiah 35:3
.
Say to those with anxious heart, "Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you." -- isaiah 35:4
.
Then the eyes of the blind will be opened And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. -- isaiah 35:5
.
Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And streams in the Arabah. -- isaiah 35:6
.
The scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass becomes reeds and rushes. -- isaiah 35:7
.
A highway will be there, a roadway, And it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, But it will be for him who walks that way, And fools will not wander on it. -- isaiah 35:8
.
No lion will be there, Nor will any vicious beast go up on it; These will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk there, -- isaiah 35:9
.
And the ransomed of the LORD will return And come with joyful shouting to Zion, With everlasting joy upon their heads. They will find gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away. -- isaiah 35:10
.
Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them. -- isaiah 36:1
.
And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller's field. -- isaiah 36:2
.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him. -- isaiah 36:3
.
Then Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, "What is this confidence that you have? -- isaiah 36:4
.
"I say, 'Your counsel and strength for the war are only empty words.' Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me? -- isaiah 36:5
.
"Behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him. -- isaiah 36:6
.
"But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar'? -- isaiah 36:7
.
"Now therefore, come make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. -- isaiah 36:8
.
"How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master's servants and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? -- isaiah 36:9
.
"Have I now come up without the LORD'S approval against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'"'" -- isaiah 36:10
.
Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall." -- isaiah 36:11
.
But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?" -- isaiah 36:12
.
Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean and said, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. -- isaiah 36:13
.
"Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you; -- isaiah 36:14
.
nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us, this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria." -- isaiah 36:15
.
'Do not listen to Hezekiah,' for thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern, -- isaiah 36:16
.
until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. -- isaiah 36:17
.
'Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you, saying, "The LORD will deliver us." Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? -- isaiah 36:18
.
'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria from my hand? -- isaiah 36:19
.
'Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD would deliver Jerusalem from my hand?'" -- isaiah 36:20
.
But they were silent and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, "Do not answer him." -- isaiah 36:21
.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh. -- isaiah 36:22
.
And when King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the LORD. -- isaiah 37:1
.
Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. -- isaiah 37:2
.
They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke and rejection; for children have come to birth, and there is no strength to deliver. -- isaiah 37:3
.
'Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.'" -- isaiah 37:4
.
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. -- isaiah 37:5
.
Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD, "Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. -- isaiah 37:6
.
"Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land."'" -- isaiah 37:7
.
Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. -- isaiah 37:8
.
When he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "He has come out to fight against you," and when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, -- isaiah 37:9
.
"Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, "Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria." -- isaiah 37:10
.
'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared? -- isaiah 37:11
.
'Did the gods of those nations which my fathers have destroyed deliver them, even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar? -- isaiah 37:12
.
'Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?'" -- isaiah 37:13
.
Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. -- isaiah 37:14
.
Hezekiah prayed to the LORD saying, -- isaiah 37:15
.
"O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. -- isaiah 37:16
.
"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent them to reproach the living God. -- isaiah 37:17
.
"Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have devastated all the countries and their lands, -- isaiah 37:18
.
and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. -- isaiah 37:19
.
"Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, LORD, are God." -- isaiah 37:20
.
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria, -- isaiah 37:21
.
this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: "She has despised you and mocked you, The virgin daughter of Zion; She has shaken her head behind you, The daughter of Jerusalem! -- isaiah 37:22
.
"Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! -- isaiah 37:23
.
"Through your servants you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, 'With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest. -- isaiah 37:24
.
'I dug wells and drank waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.' -- isaiah 37:25
.
"Have you not heard? Long ago I did it, From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps. -- isaiah 37:26
.
"Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up. -- isaiah 37:27
.
"But I know your sitting down And your going out and your coming in And your raging against Me. -- isaiah 37:28
.
"Because of your raging against Me And because your arrogance has come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back by the way which you came. -- isaiah 37:29
.
"Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit. -- isaiah 37:30
.
"The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward. -- isaiah 37:31
.
"For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this."' -- isaiah 37:32
.
"Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield, or throw up a siege ramp against it. -- isaiah 37:33
.
'By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city,' declares the LORD. -- isaiah 37:34
.
'For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.'" -- isaiah 37:35
.
Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead. -- isaiah 37:36
.
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh. -- isaiah 37:37
.
It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place. -- isaiah 37:38
.
In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.'" -- isaiah 38:1
.
Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, -- isaiah 38:2
.
and said, "Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly. -- isaiah 38:3
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, -- isaiah 38:4
.
"Go and say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David, "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life. -- isaiah 38:5
.
"I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city."' -- isaiah 38:6
.
"This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He has spoken: -- isaiah 38:7
.
"Behold, I will cause the shadow on the stairway, which has gone down with the sun on the stairway of Ahaz, to go back ten steps." So the sun's shadow went back ten steps on the stairway on which it had gone down. -- isaiah 38:8
.
A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery: -- isaiah 38:9
.
I said, "In the middle of my life I am to enter the gates of Sheol; I am to be deprived of the rest of my years." -- isaiah 38:10
.
I said, "I will not see the LORD, The LORD in the land of the living; I will look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world. -- isaiah 38:11
.
"Like a shepherd's tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me; As a weaver I rolled up my life. He cuts me off from the loom; From day until night You make an end of me. -- isaiah 38:12
.
"I composed my soul until morning. Like a lion--so He breaks all my bones, From day until night You make an end of me. -- isaiah 38:13
.
"Like a swallow, like a crane, so I twitter; I moan like a dove; My eyes look wistfully to the heights; O Lord, I am oppressed, be my security. -- isaiah 38:14
.
"What shall I say? For He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it; I will wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul. -- isaiah 38:15
.
"O Lord, by these things men live, And in all these is the life of my spirit; O restore me to health and let me live! -- isaiah 38:16
.
"Lo, for my own welfare I had great bitterness; It is You who has kept my soul from the pit of nothingness, For You have cast all my sins behind Your back. -- isaiah 38:17
.
"For Sheol cannot thank You, Death cannot praise You; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness. -- isaiah 38:18
.
"It is the living who give thanks to You, as I do today; A father tells his sons about Your faithfulness. -- isaiah 38:19
.
"The LORD will surely save me; So we will play my songs on stringed instruments All the days of our life at the house of the LORD." -- isaiah 38:20
.
Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover." -- isaiah 38:21
.
Then Hezekiah had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?" -- isaiah 38:22
.
At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered. -- isaiah 39:1
.
Hezekiah was pleased, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and his whole armory and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. -- isaiah 39:2
.
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon." -- isaiah 39:3
.
He said, "What have they seen in your house?" So Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them." -- isaiah 39:4
.
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts, -- isaiah 39:5
.
'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,' says the LORD. -- isaiah 39:6
.
'And some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, will be taken away, and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.'" -- isaiah 39:7
.
Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good." For he thought, "For there will be peace and truth in my days." -- isaiah 39:8
.
"Comfort, O comfort My people," says your God. -- isaiah 40:1
.
"Speak kindly to Jerusalem; And call out to her, that her warfare has ended, That her iniquity has been removed, That she has received of the LORD'S hand Double for all her sins." -- isaiah 40:2
.
A voice is calling, "Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God. -- isaiah 40:3
.
"Let every valley be lifted up, And every mountain and hill be made low; And let the rough ground become a plain, And the rugged terrain a broad valley; -- isaiah 40:4
.
Then the glory of the LORD will be revealed, And all flesh will see it together; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken." -- isaiah 40:5
.
A voice says, "Call out." Then he answered, "What shall I call out?" All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field. -- isaiah 40:6
.
The grass withers, the flower fades, When the breath of the LORD blows upon it; Surely the people are grass. -- isaiah 40:7
.
The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever. -- isaiah 40:8
.
Get yourself up on a high mountain, O Zion, bearer of good news, Lift up your voice mightily, O Jerusalem, bearer of good news; Lift it up, do not fear. Say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!" -- isaiah 40:9
.
Behold, the Lord GOD will come with might, With His arm ruling for Him. Behold, His reward is with Him And His recompense before Him. -- isaiah 40:10
.
Like a shepherd He will tend His flock, In His arm He will gather the lambs And carry them in His bosom; He will gently lead the nursing ewes. -- isaiah 40:11
.
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, And marked off the heavens by the span, And calculated the dust of the earth by the measure, And weighed the mountains in a balance And the hills in a pair of scales? -- isaiah 40:12
.
Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, Or as His counselor has informed Him? -- isaiah 40:13
.
With whom did He consult and who gave Him understanding? And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge And informed Him of the way of understanding? -- isaiah 40:14
.
Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust. -- isaiah 40:15
.
Even Lebanon is not enough to burn, Nor its beasts enough for a burnt offering. -- isaiah 40:16
.
All the nations are as nothing before Him, They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless. -- isaiah 40:17
.
To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare with Him? -- isaiah 40:18
.
As for the idol, a craftsman casts it, A goldsmith plates it with gold, And a silversmith fashions chains of silver. -- isaiah 40:19
.
He who is too impoverished for such an offering Selects a tree that does not rot; He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman To prepare an idol that will not totter. -- isaiah 40:20
.
Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? -- isaiah 40:21
.
It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. -- isaiah 40:22
.
He it is who reduces rulers to nothing, Who makes the judges of the earth meaningless. -- isaiah 40:23
.
Scarcely have they been planted, Scarcely have they been sown, Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth, But He merely blows on them, and they wither, And the storm carries them away like stubble. -- isaiah 40:24
.
"To whom then will you liken Me That I would be his equal?" says the Holy One. -- isaiah 40:25
.
Lift up your eyes on high And see who has created these stars, The One who leads forth their host by number, He calls them all by name; Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power, Not one of them is missing. -- isaiah 40:26
.
Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God"? -- isaiah 40:27
.
Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired. His understanding is inscrutable. -- isaiah 40:28
.
He gives strength to the weary, And to him who lacks might He increases power. -- isaiah 40:29
.
Though youths grow weary and tired, And vigorous young men stumble badly, -- isaiah 40:30
.
Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength; They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will walk and not become weary. -- isaiah 40:31
.
"Coastlands, listen to Me in silence, And let the peoples gain new strength; Let them come forward, then let them speak; Let us come together for judgment. -- isaiah 41:1
.
"Who has aroused one from the east Whom He calls in righteousness to His feet? He delivers up nations before him And subdues kings. He makes them like dust with his sword, As the wind-driven chaff with his bow. -- isaiah 41:2
.
"He pursues them, passing on in safety, By a way he had not been traversing with his feet. -- isaiah 41:3
.
"Who has performed and accomplished it, Calling forth the generations from the beginning? 'I, the LORD, am the first, and with the last. I am He.'" -- isaiah 41:4
.
The coastlands have seen and are afraid; The ends of the earth tremble; They have drawn near and have come. -- isaiah 41:5
.
Each one helps his neighbor And says to his brother, "Be strong!" -- isaiah 41:6
.
So the craftsman encourages the smelter, And he who smooths metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil, Saying of the soldering, "It is good"; And he fastens it with nails, So that it will not totter. -- isaiah 41:7
.
"But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, Descendant of Abraham My friend, -- isaiah 41:8
.
You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, And called from its remotest parts And said to you, 'You are My servant, I have chosen you and not rejected you. -- isaiah 41:9
.
'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.' -- isaiah 41:10
.
"Behold, all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored; Those who contend with you will be as nothing and will perish. -- isaiah 41:11
.
"You will seek those who quarrel with you, but will not find them, Those who war with you will be as nothing and non-existent. -- isaiah 41:12
.
"For I am the LORD your God, who upholds your right hand, Who says to you, 'Do not fear, I will help you.' -- isaiah 41:13
.
"Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel; I will help you," declares the LORD, "and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 41:14
.
"Behold, I have made you a new, sharp threshing sledge with double edges; You will thresh the mountains and pulverize them, And will make the hills like chaff. -- isaiah 41:15
.
"You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, And the storm will scatter them; But you will rejoice in the LORD, You will glory in the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 41:16
.
"The afflicted and needy are seeking water, but there is none, And their tongue is parched with thirst; I, the LORD, will answer them Myself, As the God of Israel I will not forsake them. -- isaiah 41:17
.
"I will open rivers on the bare heights And springs in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water And the dry land fountains of water. -- isaiah 41:18
.
"I will put the cedar in the wilderness, The acacia and the myrtle and the olive tree; I will place the juniper in the desert Together with the box tree and the cypress, -- isaiah 41:19
.
That they may see and recognize, And consider and gain insight as well, That the hand of the LORD has done this, And the Holy One of Israel has created it. -- isaiah 41:20
.
"Present your case," the LORD says. "Bring forward your strong arguments," The King of Jacob says. -- isaiah 41:21
.
Let them bring forth and declare to us what is going to take place; As for the former events, declare what they were, That we may consider them and know their outcome. Or announce to us what is coming; -- isaiah 41:22
.
Declare the things that are going to come afterward, That we may know that you are gods; Indeed, do good or evil, that we may anxiously look about us and fear together. -- isaiah 41:23
.
Behold, you are of no account, And your work amounts to nothing; He who chooses you is an abomination. -- isaiah 41:24
.
"I have aroused one from the north, and he has come; From the rising of the sun he will call on My name; And he will come upon rulers as upon mortar, Even as the potter treads clay." -- isaiah 41:25
.
Who has declared this from the beginning, that we might know? Or from former times, that we may say, "He is right!"? Surely there was no one who declared, Surely there was no one who proclaimed, Surely there was no one who heard your words. -- isaiah 41:26
.
"Formerly I said to Zion, 'Behold, here they are.' And to Jerusalem, 'I will give a messenger of good news.' -- isaiah 41:27
.
"But when I look, there is no one, And there is no counselor among them Who, if I ask, can give an answer. -- isaiah 41:28
.
"Behold, all of them are false; Their works are worthless, Their molten images are wind and emptiness. -- isaiah 41:29
.
"Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations. -- isaiah 42:1
.
"He will not cry out or raise His voice, Nor make His voice heard in the street. -- isaiah 42:2
.
"A bruised reed He will not break And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice. -- isaiah 42:3
.
"He will not be disheartened or crushed Until He has established justice in the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law." -- isaiah 42:4
.
Thus says God the LORD, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread out the earth and its offspring, Who gives breath to the people on it And spirit to those who walk in it, -- isaiah 42:5
.
"I am the LORD, I have called You in righteousness, I will also hold You by the hand and watch over You, And I will appoint You as a covenant to the people, As a light to the nations, -- isaiah 42:6
.
To open blind eyes, To bring out prisoners from the dungeon And those who dwell in darkness from the prison. -- isaiah 42:7
.
"I am the LORD, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, Nor My praise to graven images. -- isaiah 42:8
.
"Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I declare new things; Before they spring forth I proclaim them to you." -- isaiah 42:9
.
Sing to the LORD a new song, Sing His praise from the end of the earth! You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it. You islands, and those who dwell on them. -- isaiah 42:10
.
Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voices, The settlements where Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing aloud, Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains. -- isaiah 42:11
.
Let them give glory to the LORD And declare His praise in the coastlands. -- isaiah 42:12
.
The LORD will go forth like a warrior, He will arouse His zeal like a man of war. He will utter a shout, yes, He will raise a war cry. He will prevail against His enemies. -- isaiah 42:13
.
"I have kept silent for a long time, I have kept still and restrained Myself. Now like a woman in labor I will groan, I will both gasp and pant. -- isaiah 42:14
.
"I will lay waste the mountains and hills And wither all their vegetation; I will make the rivers into coastlands And dry up the ponds. -- isaiah 42:15
.
"I will lead the blind by a way they do not know, In paths they do not know I will guide them. I will make darkness into light before them And rugged places into plains. These are the things I will do, And I will not leave them undone." -- isaiah 42:16
.
They will be turned back and be utterly put to shame, Who trust in idols, Who say to molten images, "You are our gods." -- isaiah 42:17
.
Hear, you deaf! And look, you blind, that you may see. -- isaiah 42:18
.
Who is blind but My servant, Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is so blind as he that is at peace with Me, Or so blind as the servant of the LORD? -- isaiah 42:19
.
You have seen many things, but you do not observe them; Your ears are open, but none hears. -- isaiah 42:20
.
The LORD was pleased for His righteousness' sake To make the law great and glorious. -- isaiah 42:21
.
But this is a people plundered and despoiled; All of them are trapped in caves, Or are hidden away in prisons; They have become a prey with none to deliver them, And a spoil, with none to say, "Give them back!" -- isaiah 42:22
.
Who among you will give ear to this? Who will give heed and listen hereafter? -- isaiah 42:23
.
Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, And in whose ways they were not willing to walk, And whose law they did not obey? -- isaiah 42:24
.
So He poured out on him the heat of His anger And the fierceness of battle; And it set him aflame all around, Yet he did not recognize it; And it burned him, but he paid no attention. -- isaiah 42:25
.
But now, thus says the LORD, your Creator, O Jacob, And He who formed you, O Israel, "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine! -- isaiah 43:1
.
"When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn you. -- isaiah 43:2
.
"For I am the LORD your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in your place. -- isaiah 43:3
.
"Since you are precious in My sight, Since you are honored and I love you, I will give other men in your place and other peoples in exchange for your life. -- isaiah 43:4
.
"Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, And gather you from the west. -- isaiah 43:5
.
"I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' And to the south, 'Do not hold them back.' Bring My sons from afar And My daughters from the ends of the earth, -- isaiah 43:6
.
Everyone who is called by My name, And whom I have created for My glory, Whom I have formed, even whom I have made." -- isaiah 43:7
.
Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes, And the deaf, even though they have ears. -- isaiah 43:8
.
All the nations have gathered together So that the peoples may be assembled. Who among them can declare this And proclaim to us the former things? Let them present their witnesses that they may be justified, Or let them hear and say, "It is true." -- isaiah 43:9
.
"You are My witnesses," declares the LORD, "And My servant whom I have chosen, So that you may know and believe Me And understand that I am He. Before Me there was no God formed, And there will be none after Me. -- isaiah 43:10
.
"I, even I, am the LORD, And there is no savior besides Me. -- isaiah 43:11
.
"It is I who have declared and saved and proclaimed, And there was no strange god among you; So you are My witnesses," declares the LORD, "And I am God. -- isaiah 43:12
.
"Even from eternity I am He, And there is none who can deliver out of My hand; I act and who can reverse it?" -- isaiah 43:13
.
Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, "For your sake I have sent to Babylon, And will bring them all down as fugitives, Even the Chaldeans, into the ships in which they rejoice. -- isaiah 43:14
.
"I am the LORD, your Holy One, The Creator of Israel, your King." -- isaiah 43:15
.
Thus says the LORD, Who makes a way through the sea And a path through the mighty waters, -- isaiah 43:16
.
Who brings forth the chariot and the horse, The army and the mighty man (They will lie down together and not rise again; They have been quenched and extinguished like a wick): -- isaiah 43:17
.
"Do not call to mind the former things, Or ponder things of the past. -- isaiah 43:18
.
"Behold, I will do something new, Now it will spring forth; Will you not be aware of it? I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, Rivers in the desert. -- isaiah 43:19
.
"The beasts of the field will glorify Me, The jackals and the ostriches, Because I have given waters in the wilderness And rivers in the desert, To give drink to My chosen people. -- isaiah 43:20
.
"The people whom I formed for Myself Will declare My praise. -- isaiah 43:21
.
"Yet you have not called on Me, O Jacob; But you have become weary of Me, O Israel. -- isaiah 43:22
.
"You have not brought to Me the sheep of your burnt offerings, Nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, Nor wearied you with incense. -- isaiah 43:23
.
"You have bought Me not sweet cane with money, Nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices; Rather you have burdened Me with your sins, You have wearied Me with your iniquities. -- isaiah 43:24
.
"I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake, And I will not remember your sins. -- isaiah 43:25
.
"Put Me in remembrance, let us argue our case together; State your cause, that you may be proved right. -- isaiah 43:26
.
"Your first forefather sinned, And your spokesmen have transgressed against Me. -- isaiah 43:27
.
"So I will pollute the princes of the sanctuary, And I will consign Jacob to the ban and Israel to revilement. -- isaiah 43:28
.
"But now listen, O Jacob, My servant, And Israel, whom I have chosen: -- isaiah 44:1
.
Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you, 'Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen. -- isaiah 44:2
.
'For I will pour out water on the thirsty land And streams on the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring And My blessing on your descendants; -- isaiah 44:3
.
And they will spring up among the grass Like poplars by streams of water.' -- isaiah 44:4
.
"This one will say, 'I am the LORD'S'; And that one will call on the name of Jacob; And another will write on his hand, 'Belonging to the LORD,' And will name Israel's name with honor. -- isaiah 44:5
.
"Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me. -- isaiah 44:6
.
'Who is like Me? Let him proclaim and declare it; Yes, let him recount it to Me in order, From the time that I established the ancient nation. And let them declare to them the things that are coming And the events that are going to take place. -- isaiah 44:7
.
'Do not tremble and do not be afraid; Have I not long since announced it to you and declared it? And you are My witnesses. Is there any God besides Me, Or is there any other Rock? I know of none.'" -- isaiah 44:8
.
Those who fashion a graven image are all of them futile, and their precious things are of no profit; even their own witnesses fail to see or know, so that they will be put to shame. -- isaiah 44:9
.
Who has fashioned a god or cast an idol to no profit? -- isaiah 44:10
.
Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are mere men. Let them all assemble themselves, let them stand up, let them tremble, let them together be put to shame. -- isaiah 44:11
.
The man shapes iron into a cutting tool and does his work over the coals, fashioning it with hammers and working it with his strong arm. He also gets hungry and his strength fails; he drinks no water and becomes weary. -- isaiah 44:12
.
Another shapes wood, he extends a measuring line; he outlines it with red chalk. He works it with planes and outlines it with a compass, and makes it like the form of a man, like the beauty of man, so that it may sit in a house. -- isaiah 44:13
.
Surely he cuts cedars for himself, and takes a cypress or an oak and raises it for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir, and the rain makes it grow. -- isaiah 44:14
.
Then it becomes something for a man to burn, so he takes one of them and warms himself; he also makes a fire to bake bread. He also makes a god and worships it; he makes it a graven image and falls down before it. -- isaiah 44:15
.
Half of it he burns in the fire; over this half he eats meat as he roasts a roast and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, "Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire." -- isaiah 44:16
.
But the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image. He falls down before it and worships; he also prays to it and says, "Deliver me, for you are my god." -- isaiah 44:17
.
They do not know, nor do they understand, for He has smeared over their eyes so that they cannot see and their hearts so that they cannot comprehend. -- isaiah 44:18
.
No one recalls, nor is there knowledge or understanding to say, "I have burned half of it in the fire and also have baked bread over its coals. I roast meat and eat it. Then I make the rest of it into an abomination, I fall down before a block of wood!" -- isaiah 44:19
.
He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside. And he cannot deliver himself, nor say, "Is there not a lie in my right hand?" -- isaiah 44:20
.
"Remember these things, O Jacob, And Israel, for you are My servant; I have formed you, you are My servant, O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me. -- isaiah 44:21
.
"I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you." -- isaiah 44:22
.
Shout for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done it! Shout joyfully, you lower parts of the earth; Break forth into a shout of joy, you mountains, O forest, and every tree in it; For the LORD has redeemed Jacob And in Israel He shows forth His glory. -- isaiah 44:23
.
Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, "I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, Stretching out the heavens by Myself And spreading out the earth all alone, -- isaiah 44:24
.
Causing the omens of boasters to fail, Making fools out of diviners, Causing wise men to draw back And turning their knowledge into foolishness, -- isaiah 44:25
.
Confirming the word of His servant And performing the purpose of His messengers. It is I who says of Jerusalem, 'She shall be inhabited!' And of the cities of Judah, 'They shall be built.' And I will raise up her ruins again. -- isaiah 44:26
.
"It is I who says to the depth of the sea, 'Be dried up!' And I will make your rivers dry. -- isaiah 44:27
.
"It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'" -- isaiah 44:28
.
Thus says the LORD to Cyrus His anointed, Whom I have taken by the right hand, To subdue nations before him And to loose the loins of kings; To open doors before him so that gates will not be shut: -- isaiah 45:1
.
"I will go before you and make the rough places smooth; I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through their iron bars. -- isaiah 45:2
.
"I will give you the treasures of darkness And hidden wealth of secret places, So that you may know that it is I, The LORD, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name. -- isaiah 45:3
.
"For the sake of Jacob My servant, And Israel My chosen one, I have also called you by your name; I have given you a title of honor Though you have not known Me. -- isaiah 45:4
.
"I am the LORD, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God. I will gird you, though you have not known Me; -- isaiah 45:5
.
That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun That there is no one besides Me. I am the LORD, and there is no other, -- isaiah 45:6
.
The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the LORD who does all these. -- isaiah 45:7
.
"Drip down, O heavens, from above, And let the clouds pour down righteousness; Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit, And righteousness spring up with it. I, the LORD, have created it. -- isaiah 45:8
.
"Woe to the one who quarrels with his Maker-- An earthenware vessel among the vessels of earth! Will the clay say to the potter, 'What are you doing?' Or the thing you are making say, 'He has no hands'? -- isaiah 45:9
.
"Woe to him who says to a father, 'What are you begetting?' Or to a woman, 'To what are you giving birth?'" -- isaiah 45:10
.
Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: "Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, And you shall commit to Me the work of My hands. -- isaiah 45:11
.
"It is I who made the earth, and created man upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands And I ordained all their host. -- isaiah 45:12
.
"I have aroused him in righteousness And I will make all his ways smooth; He will build My city and will let My exiles go free, Without any payment or reward," says the LORD of hosts. -- isaiah 45:13
.
Thus says the LORD, "The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush And the Sabeans, men of stature, Will come over to you and will be yours; They will walk behind you, they will come over in chains And will bow down to you; They will make supplication to you: 'Surely, God is with you, and there is none else, No other God.'" -- isaiah 45:14
.
Truly, You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, Savior! -- isaiah 45:15
.
They will be put to shame and even humiliated, all of them; The manufacturers of idols will go away together in humiliation. -- isaiah 45:16
.
Israel has been saved by the LORD With an everlasting salvation; You will not be put to shame or humiliated To all eternity. -- isaiah 45:17
.
For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (He is the God who formed the earth and made it, He established it and did not create it a waste place, but formed it to be inhabited), "I am the LORD, and there is none else. -- isaiah 45:18
.
"I have not spoken in secret, In some dark land; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, 'Seek Me in a waste place'; I, the LORD, speak righteousness, Declaring things that are upright. -- isaiah 45:19
.
"Gather yourselves and come; Draw near together, you fugitives of the nations; They have no knowledge, Who carry about their wooden idol And pray to a god who cannot save. -- isaiah 45:20
.
"Declare and set forth your case; Indeed, let them consult together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has long since declared it? Is it not I, the LORD? And there is no other God besides Me, A righteous God and a Savior; There is none except Me. -- isaiah 45:21
.
"Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other. -- isaiah 45:22
.
"I have sworn by Myself, The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance. -- isaiah 45:23
.
"They will say of Me, 'Only in the LORD are righteousness and strength.' Men will come to Him, And all who were angry at Him will be put to shame. -- isaiah 45:24
.
"In the LORD all the offspring of Israel Will be justified and will glory." -- isaiah 45:25
.
Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over; Their images are consigned to the beasts and the cattle. The things that you carry are burdensome, A load for the weary beast. -- isaiah 46:1
.
They stooped over, they have bowed down together; They could not rescue the burden, But have themselves gone into captivity. -- isaiah 46:2
.
"Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been borne by Me from birth And have been carried from the womb; -- isaiah 46:3
.
Even to your old age I will be the same, And even to your graying years I will bear you! I have done it, and I will carry you; And I will bear you and I will deliver you. -- isaiah 46:4
.
"To whom would you liken Me And make Me equal and compare Me, That we would be alike? -- isaiah 46:5
.
"Those who lavish gold from the purse And weigh silver on the scale Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; They bow down, indeed they worship it. -- isaiah 46:6
.
"They lift it upon the shoulder and carry it; They set it in its place and it stands there. It does not move from its place. Though one may cry to it, it cannot answer; It cannot deliver him from his distress. -- isaiah 46:7
.
"Remember this, and be assured; Recall it to mind, you transgressors. -- isaiah 46:8
.
"Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me, -- isaiah 46:9
.
Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure'; -- isaiah 46:10
.
Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, surely I will do it. -- isaiah 46:11
.
"Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded, Who are far from righteousness. -- isaiah 46:12
.
"I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off; And My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, And My glory for Israel. -- isaiah 46:13
.
"Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans! For you shall no longer be called tender and delicate. -- isaiah 47:1
.
"Take the millstones and grind meal. Remove your veil, strip off the skirt, Uncover the leg, cross the rivers. -- isaiah 47:2
.
"Your nakedness will be uncovered, Your shame also will be exposed; I will take vengeance and will not spare a man." -- isaiah 47:3
.
Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, The Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 47:4
.
"Sit silently, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans, For you will no longer be called The queen of kingdoms. -- isaiah 47:5
.
"I was angry with My people, I profaned My heritage And gave them into your hand. You did not show mercy to them, On the aged you made your yoke very heavy. -- isaiah 47:6
.
"Yet you said, 'I will be a queen forever.' These things you did not consider Nor remember the outcome of them. -- isaiah 47:7
.
"Now, then, hear this, you sensual one, Who dwells securely, Who says in your heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides me. I will not sit as a widow, Nor know loss of children.' -- isaiah 47:8
.
"But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day: Loss of children and widowhood. They will come on you in full measure In spite of your many sorceries, In spite of the great power of your spells. -- isaiah 47:9
.
"You felt secure in your wickedness and said, 'No one sees me,' Your wisdom and your knowledge, they have deluded you; For you have said in your heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides me.' -- isaiah 47:10
.
"But evil will come on you Which you will not know how to charm away; And disaster will fall on you For which you cannot atone; And destruction about which you do not know Will come on you suddenly. -- isaiah 47:11
.
"Stand fast now in your spells And in your many sorceries With which you have labored from your youth; Perhaps you will be able to profit, Perhaps you may cause trembling. -- isaiah 47:12
.
"You are wearied with your many counsels; Let now the astrologers, Those who prophesy by the stars, Those who predict by the new moons, Stand up and save you from what will come upon you. -- isaiah 47:13
.
"Behold, they have become like stubble, Fire burns them; They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame; There will be no coal to warm by Nor a fire to sit before! -- isaiah 47:14
.
"So have those become to you with whom you have labored, Who have trafficked with you from your youth; Each has wandered in his own way; There is none to save you. -- isaiah 47:15
.
"Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are named Israel And who came forth from the loins of Judah, Who swear by the name of the LORD And invoke the God of Israel, But not in truth nor in righteousness. -- isaiah 48:1
.
"For they call themselves after the holy city And lean on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is His name. -- isaiah 48:2
.
"I declared the former things long ago And they went forth from My mouth, and I proclaimed them. Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass. -- isaiah 48:3
.
"Because I know that you are obstinate, And your neck is an iron sinew And your forehead bronze, -- isaiah 48:4
.
Therefore I declared them to you long ago, Before they took place I proclaimed them to you, So that you would not say, 'My idol has done them, And my graven image and my molten image have commanded them.' -- isaiah 48:5
.
"You have heard; look at all this. And you, will you not declare it? I proclaim to you new things from this time, Even hidden things which you have not known. -- isaiah 48:6
.
"They are created now and not long ago; And before today you have not heard them, So that you will not say, 'Behold, I knew them.' -- isaiah 48:7
.
"You have not heard, you have not known. Even from long ago your ear has not been open, Because I knew that you would deal very treacherously; And you have been called a rebel from birth. -- isaiah 48:8
.
"For the sake of My name I delay My wrath, And for My praise I restrain it for you, In order not to cut you off. -- isaiah 48:9
.
"Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. -- isaiah 48:10
.
"For My own sake, for My own sake, I will act; For how can My name be profaned? And My glory I will not give to another. -- isaiah 48:11
.
"Listen to Me, O Jacob, even Israel whom I called; I am He, I am the first, I am also the last. -- isaiah 48:12
.
"Surely My hand founded the earth, And My right hand spread out the heavens; When I call to them, they stand together. -- isaiah 48:13
.
"Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he will carry out His good pleasure on Babylon, And His arm will be against the Chaldeans. -- isaiah 48:14
.
"I, even I, have spoken; indeed I have called him, I have brought him, and He will make his ways successful. -- isaiah 48:15
.
"Come near to Me, listen to this: From the first I have not spoken in secret, From the time it took place, I was there. And now the Lord GOD has sent Me, and His Spirit." -- isaiah 48:16
.
Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, "I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to profit, Who leads you in the way you should go. -- isaiah 48:17
.
"If only you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your well-being would have been like a river, And your righteousness like the waves of the sea. -- isaiah 48:18
.
"Your descendants would have been like the sand, And your offspring like its grains; Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from My presence." -- isaiah 48:19
.
Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare with the sound of joyful shouting, proclaim this, Send it out to the end of the earth; Say, "The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob." -- isaiah 48:20
.
They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. He made the water flow out of the rock for them; He split the rock and the water gushed forth. -- isaiah 48:21
.
"There is no peace for the wicked," says the LORD. -- isaiah 48:22
.
Listen to Me, O islands, And pay attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called Me from the womb; From the body of My mother He named Me. -- isaiah 49:1
.
He has made My mouth like a sharp sword, In the shadow of His hand He has concealed Me; And He has also made Me a select arrow, He has hidden Me in His quiver. -- isaiah 49:2
.
He said to Me, "You are My Servant, Israel, In Whom I will show My glory." -- isaiah 49:3
.
But I said, "I have toiled in vain, I have spent My strength for nothing and vanity; Yet surely the justice due to Me is with the LORD, And My reward with My God." -- isaiah 49:4
.
And now says the LORD, who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, To bring Jacob back to Him, so that Israel might be gathered to Him (For I am honored in the sight of the LORD, And My God is My strength), -- isaiah 49:5
.
He says, "It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also make You a light of the nations So that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth." -- isaiah 49:6
.
Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and its Holy One, To the despised One, To the One abhorred by the nation, To the Servant of rulers, "Kings will see and arise, Princes will also bow down, Because of the LORD who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen You." -- isaiah 49:7
.
Thus says the LORD, "In a favorable time I have answered You, And in a day of salvation I have helped You; And I will keep You and give You for a covenant of the people, To restore the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages; -- isaiah 49:8
.
Saying to those who are bound, 'Go forth,' To those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves.' Along the roads they will feed, And their pasture will be on all bare heights. -- isaiah 49:9
.
"They will not hunger or thirst, Nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them down; For He who has compassion on them will lead them And will guide them to springs of water. -- isaiah 49:10
.
"I will make all My mountains a road, And My highways will be raised up. -- isaiah 49:11
.
"Behold, these will come from afar; And lo, these will come from the north and from the west, And these from the land of Sinim." -- isaiah 49:12
.
Shout for joy, O heavens! And rejoice, O earth! Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people And will have compassion on His afflicted. -- isaiah 49:13
.
But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, And the Lord has forgotten me." -- isaiah 49:14
.
"Can a woman forget her nursing child And have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, but I will not forget you. -- isaiah 49:15
.
"Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; Your walls are continually before Me. -- isaiah 49:16
.
"Your builders hurry; Your destroyers and devastators Will depart from you. -- isaiah 49:17
.
"Lift up your eyes and look around; All of them gather together, they come to you. As I live," declares the LORD, "You will surely put on all of them as jewels and bind them on as a bride. -- isaiah 49:18
.
"For your waste and desolate places and your destroyed land-- Surely now you will be too cramped for the inhabitants, And those who swallowed you will be far away. -- isaiah 49:19
.
"The children of whom you were bereaved will yet say in your ears, 'The place is too cramped for me; Make room for me that I may live here.' -- isaiah 49:20
.
"Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has begotten these for me, Since I have been bereaved of my children And am barren, an exile and a wanderer? And who has reared these? Behold, I was left alone; From where did these come?'" -- isaiah 49:21
.
Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations And set up My standard to the peoples; And they will bring your sons in their bosom, And your daughters will be carried on their shoulders. -- isaiah 49:22
.
"Kings will be your guardians, And their princesses your nurses. They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth And lick the dust of your feet; And you will know that I am the LORD; Those who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame. -- isaiah 49:23
.
"Can the prey be taken from the mighty man, Or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?" -- isaiah 49:24
.
Surely, thus says the LORD, "Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away, And the prey of the tyrant will be rescued; For I will contend with the one who contends with you, And I will save your sons. -- isaiah 49:25
.
"I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh, And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine; And all flesh will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob." -- isaiah 49:26
.
Thus says the LORD, "Where is the certificate of divorce By which I have sent your mother away? Or to whom of My creditors did I sell you? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities, And for your transgressions your mother was sent away. -- isaiah 50:1
.
"Why was there no man when I came? When I called, why was there none to answer? Is My hand so short that it cannot ransom? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke, I make the rivers a wilderness; Their fish stink for lack of water And die of thirst. -- isaiah 50:2
.
"I clothe the heavens with blackness And make sackcloth their covering." -- isaiah 50:3
.
The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, That I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple. -- isaiah 50:4
.
The Lord GOD has opened My ear; And I was not disobedient Nor did I turn back. -- isaiah 50:5
.
I gave My back to those who strike Me, And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard; I did not cover My face from humiliation and spitting. -- isaiah 50:6
.
For the Lord GOD helps Me, Therefore, I am not disgraced; Therefore, I have set My face like flint, And I know that I will not be ashamed. -- isaiah 50:7
.
He who vindicates Me is near; Who will contend with Me? Let us stand up to each other; Who has a case against Me? Let him draw near to Me. -- isaiah 50:8
.
Behold, the Lord GOD helps Me; Who is he who condemns Me? Behold, they will all wear out like a garment; The moth will eat them. -- isaiah 50:9
.
Who is among you that fears the LORD, That obeys the voice of His servant, That walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God. -- isaiah 50:10
.
Behold, all you who kindle a fire, Who encircle yourselves with firebrands, Walk in the light of your fire And among the brands you have set ablaze. This you will have from My hand: You will lie down in torment. -- isaiah 50:11
.
"Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, Who seek the LORD: Look to the rock from which you were hewn And to the quarry from which you were dug. -- isaiah 51:1
.
"Look to Abraham your father And to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain; When he was but one I called him, Then I blessed him and multiplied him." -- isaiah 51:2
.
Indeed, the LORD will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places. And her wilderness He will make like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the LORD; Joy and gladness will be found in her, Thanksgiving and sound of a melody. -- isaiah 51:3
.
"Pay attention to Me, O My people, And give ear to Me, O My nation; For a law will go forth from Me, And I will set My justice for a light of the peoples. -- isaiah 51:4
.
"My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone forth, And My arms will judge the peoples; The coastlands will wait for Me, And for My arm they will wait expectantly. -- isaiah 51:5
.
"Lift up your eyes to the sky, Then look to the earth beneath; For the sky will vanish like smoke, And the earth will wear out like a garment And its inhabitants will die in like manner; But My salvation will be forever, And My righteousness will not wane. -- isaiah 51:6
.
"Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, A people in whose heart is My law; Do not fear the reproach of man, Nor be dismayed at their revilings. -- isaiah 51:7
.
"For the moth will eat them like a garment, And the grub will eat them like wool. But My righteousness will be forever, And My salvation to all generations." -- isaiah 51:8
.
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; Awake as in the days of old, the generations of long ago. Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces, Who pierced the dragon? -- isaiah 51:9
.
Was it not You who dried up the sea, The waters of the great deep; Who made the depths of the sea a pathway For the redeemed to cross over? -- isaiah 51:10
.
So the ransomed of the LORD will return And come with joyful shouting to Zion, And everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away. -- isaiah 51:11
.
"I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies And of the son of man who is made like grass, -- isaiah 51:12
.
That you have forgotten the LORD your Maker, Who stretched out the heavens And laid the foundations of the earth, That you fear continually all day long because of the fury of the oppressor, As he makes ready to destroy? But where is the fury of the oppressor? -- isaiah 51:13
.
"The exile will soon be set free, and will not die in the dungeon, nor will his bread be lacking. -- isaiah 51:14
.
"For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar (the LORD of hosts is His name). -- isaiah 51:15
.
"I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, 'You are My people.'" -- isaiah 51:16
.
Rouse yourself! Rouse yourself! Arise, O Jerusalem, You who have drunk from the LORD'S hand the cup of His anger; The chalice of reeling you have drained to the dregs. -- isaiah 51:17
.
There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne, Nor is there one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has reared. -- isaiah 51:18
.
These two things have befallen you; Who will mourn for you? The devastation and destruction, famine and sword; How shall I comfort you? -- isaiah 51:19
.
Your sons have fainted, They lie helpless at the head of every street, Like an antelope in a net, Full of the wrath of the LORD, The rebuke of your God. -- isaiah 51:20
.
Therefore, please hear this, you afflicted, Who are drunk, but not with wine: -- isaiah 51:21
.
Thus says your Lord, the LORD, even your God Who contends for His people, "Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of reeling, The chalice of My anger; You will never drink it again. -- isaiah 51:22
.
"I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, Who have said to you, 'Lie down that we may walk over you.' You have even made your back like the ground And like the street for those who walk over it." -- isaiah 51:23
.
Awake, awake, Clothe yourself in your strength, O Zion; Clothe yourself in your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; For the uncircumcised and the unclean Will no longer come into you. -- isaiah 52:1
.
Shake yourself from the dust, rise up, O captive Jerusalem; Loose yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion. -- isaiah 52:2
.
For thus says the LORD, "You were sold for nothing and you will be redeemed without money." -- isaiah 52:3
.
For thus says the Lord GOD, "My people went down at the first into Egypt to reside there; then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. -- isaiah 52:4
.
"Now therefore, what do I have here," declares the LORD, "seeing that My people have been taken away without cause?" Again the LORD declares, "Those who rule over them howl, and My name is continually blasphemed all day long. -- isaiah 52:5
.
"Therefore My people shall know My name; therefore in that day I am the one who is speaking, 'Here I am.'" -- isaiah 52:6
.
How lovely on the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace And brings good news of happiness, Who announces salvation, And says to Zion, "Your God reigns!" -- isaiah 52:7
.
Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices, They shout joyfully together; For they will see with their own eyes When the LORD restores Zion. -- isaiah 52:8
.
Break forth, shout joyfully together, You waste places of Jerusalem; For the LORD has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. -- isaiah 52:9
.
The LORD has bared His holy arm In the sight of all the nations, That all the ends of the earth may see The salvation of our God. -- isaiah 52:10
.
Depart, depart, go out from there, Touch nothing unclean; Go out of the midst of her, purify yourselves, You who carry the vessels of the LORD. -- isaiah 52:11
.
But you will not go out in haste, Nor will you go as fugitives; For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel will be your rear guard. -- isaiah 52:12
.
Behold, My servant will prosper, He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted. -- isaiah 52:13
.
Just as many were astonished at you, My people, So His appearance was marred more than any man And His form more than the sons of men. -- isaiah 52:14
.
Thus He will sprinkle many nations, Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him; For what had not been told them they will see, And what they had not heard they will understand. -- isaiah 52:15
.
Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? -- isaiah 53:1
.
For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root out of parched ground; He has no stately form or majesty That we should look upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him. -- isaiah 53:2
.
He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. -- isaiah 53:3
.
Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted. -- isaiah 53:4
.
But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed. -- isaiah 53:5
.
All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him. -- isaiah 53:6
.
He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth. -- isaiah 53:7
.
By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due? -- isaiah 53:8
.
His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth. -- isaiah 53:9
.
But the LORD was pleased To crush Him, putting Him to grief; If He would render Himself as a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, And the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand. -- isaiah 53:10
.
As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see it and be satisfied; By His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, As He will bear their iniquities. -- isaiah 53:11
.
Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He will divide the booty with the strong; Because He poured out Himself to death, And was numbered with the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the transgressors. -- isaiah 53:12
.
"Shout for joy, O barren one, you who have borne no child; Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not travailed; For the sons of the desolate one will be more numerous Than the sons of the married woman," says the LORD. -- isaiah 54:1
.
"Enlarge the place of your tent; Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, spare not; Lengthen your cords And strengthen your pegs. -- isaiah 54:2
.
"For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left. And your descendants will possess nations And will resettle the desolate cities. -- isaiah 54:3
.
"Fear not, for you will not be put to shame; And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced; But you will forget the shame of your youth, And the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more. -- isaiah 54:4
.
"For your husband is your Maker, Whose name is the LORD of hosts; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Who is called the God of all the earth. -- isaiah 54:5
.
"For the LORD has called you, Like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, Even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected," Says your God. -- isaiah 54:6
.
"For a brief moment I forsook you, But with great compassion I will gather you. -- isaiah 54:7
.
"In an outburst of anger I hid My face from you for a moment, But with everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you," Says the LORD your Redeemer. -- isaiah 54:8
.
"For this is like the days of Noah to Me, When I swore that the waters of Noah Would not flood the earth again; So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you Nor will I rebuke you. -- isaiah 54:9
.
"For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake, But My lovingkindness will not be removed from you, And My covenant of peace will not be shaken," Says the LORD who has compassion on you. -- isaiah 54:10
.
"O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted, Behold, I will set your stones in antimony, And your foundations I will lay in sapphires. -- isaiah 54:11
.
"Moreover, I will make your battlements of rubies, And your gates of crystal, And your entire wall of precious stones. -- isaiah 54:12
.
"All your sons will be taught of the LORD; And the well-being of your sons will be great. -- isaiah 54:13
.
"In righteousness you will be established; You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; And from terror, for it will not come near you. -- isaiah 54:14
.
"If anyone fiercely assails you it will not be from Me. Whoever assails you will fall because of you. -- isaiah 54:15
.
"Behold, I Myself have created the smith who blows the fire of coals And brings out a weapon for its work; And I have created the destroyer to ruin. -- isaiah 54:16
.
"No weapon that is formed against you will prosper; And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me," declares the LORD. -- isaiah 54:17
.
"Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters; And you who have no money come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and without cost. -- isaiah 55:1
.
"Why do you spend money for what is not bread, And your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, And delight yourself in abundance. -- isaiah 55:2
.
"Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, that you may live; And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, According to the faithful mercies shown to David. -- isaiah 55:3
.
"Behold, I have made him a witness to the peoples, A leader and commander for the peoples. -- isaiah 55:4
.
"Behold, you will call a nation you do not know, And a nation which knows you not will run to you, Because of the LORD your God, even the Holy One of Israel; For He has glorified you." -- isaiah 55:5
.
Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call upon Him while He is near. -- isaiah 55:6
.
Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him, And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. -- isaiah 55:7
.
"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways," declares the LORD. -- isaiah 55:8
.
"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts than your thoughts. -- isaiah 55:9
.
"For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth And making it bear and sprout, And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater; -- isaiah 55:10
.
So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it. -- isaiah 55:11
.
"For you will go out with joy And be led forth with peace; The mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you, And all the trees of the field will clap their hands. -- isaiah 55:12
.
"Instead of the thorn bush the cypress will come up, And instead of the nettle the myrtle will come up, And it will be a memorial to the LORD, For an everlasting sign which will not be cut off." -- isaiah 55:13
.
Thus says the LORD, "Preserve justice and do righteousness, For My salvation is about to come And My righteousness to be revealed. -- isaiah 56:1
.
"How blessed is the man who does this, And the son of man who takes hold of it; Who keeps from profaning the sabbath, And keeps his hand from doing any evil." -- isaiah 56:2
.
Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The LORD will surely separate me from His people." Nor let the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree." -- isaiah 56:3
.
For thus says the LORD, "To the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths, And choose what pleases Me, And hold fast My covenant, -- isaiah 56:4
.
To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial, And a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name which will not be cut off. -- isaiah 56:5
.
"Also the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, To minister to Him, and to love the name of the LORD, To be His servants, every one who keeps from profaning the sabbath And holds fast My covenant; -- isaiah 56:6
.
Even those I will bring to My holy mountain And make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar; For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples." -- isaiah 56:7
.
The Lord GOD, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares, "Yet others I will gather to them, to those already gathered." -- isaiah 56:8
.
All you beasts of the field, All you beasts in the forest, Come to eat. -- isaiah 56:9
.
His watchmen are blind, All of them know nothing. All of them are mute dogs unable to bark, Dreamers lying down, who love to slumber; -- isaiah 56:10
.
And the dogs are greedy, they are not satisfied. And they are shepherds who have no understanding; They have all turned to their own way, Each one to his unjust gain, to the last one. -- isaiah 56:11
.
"Come," they say, "let us get wine, and let us drink heavily of strong drink; And tomorrow will be like today, only more so." -- isaiah 56:12
.
The righteous man perishes, and no man takes it to heart; And devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from evil, -- isaiah 57:1
.
He enters into peace; They rest in their beds, Each one who walked in his upright way. -- isaiah 57:2
.
"But come here, you sons of a sorceress, Offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute. -- isaiah 57:3
.
"Against whom do you jest? Against whom do you open wide your mouth And stick out your tongue? Are you not children of rebellion, Offspring of deceit, -- isaiah 57:4
.
Who inflame yourselves among the oaks, Under every luxuriant tree, Who slaughter the children in the ravines, Under the clefts of the crags? -- isaiah 57:5
.
"Among the smooth stones of the ravine Is your portion, they are your lot; Even to them you have poured out a drink offering, You have made a grain offering. Shall I relent concerning these things? -- isaiah 57:6
.
"Upon a high and lofty mountain You have made your bed. You also went up there to offer sacrifice. -- isaiah 57:7
.
"Behind the door and the doorpost You have set up your sign; Indeed, far removed from Me, you have uncovered yourself, And have gone up and made your bed wide. And you have made an agreement for yourself with them, You have loved their bed, You have looked on their manhood. -- isaiah 57:8
.
"You have journeyed to the king with oil And increased your perfumes; You have sent your envoys a great distance And made them go down to Sheol. -- isaiah 57:9
.
"You were tired out by the length of your road, Yet you did not say, 'It is hopeless.' You found renewed strength, Therefore you did not faint. -- isaiah 57:10
.
"Of whom were you worried and fearful When you lied, and did not remember Me Nor give Me a thought? Was I not silent even for a long time So you do not fear Me? -- isaiah 57:11
.
"I will declare your righteousness and your deeds, But they will not profit you. -- isaiah 57:12
.
"When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you. But the wind will carry all of them up, And a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in Me will inherit the land And will possess My holy mountain." -- isaiah 57:13
.
And it will be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, Remove every obstacle out of the way of My people." -- isaiah 57:14
.
For thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy, "I dwell on a high and holy place, And also with the contrite and lowly of spirit In order to revive the spirit of the lowly And to revive the heart of the contrite. -- isaiah 57:15
.
"For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always be angry; For the spirit would grow faint before Me, And the breath of those whom I have made. -- isaiah 57:16
.
"Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry and struck him; I hid My face and was angry, And he went on turning away, in the way of his heart. -- isaiah 57:17
.
"I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and to his mourners, -- isaiah 57:18
.
Creating the praise of the lips. Peace, peace to him who is far and to him who is near," Says the LORD, "and I will heal him." -- isaiah 57:19
.
But the wicked are like the tossing sea, For it cannot be quiet, And its waters toss up refuse and mud. -- isaiah 57:20
.
"There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked." -- isaiah 57:21
.
"Cry loudly, do not hold back; Raise your voice like a trumpet, And declare to My people their transgression And to the house of Jacob their sins. -- isaiah 58:1
.
"Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways, As a nation that has done righteousness And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. They ask Me for just decisions, They delight in the nearness of God. -- isaiah 58:2
.
'Why have we fasted and You do not see? Why have we humbled ourselves and You do not notice?' Behold, on the day of your fast you find your desire, And drive hard all your workers. -- isaiah 58:3
.
"Behold, you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist. You do not fast like you do today to make your voice heard on high. -- isaiah 58:4
.
"Is it a fast like this which I choose, a day for a man to humble himself? Is it for bowing one's head like a reed And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed? Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the LORD? -- isaiah 58:5
.
"Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen the bonds of wickedness, To undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free And break every yoke? -- isaiah 58:6
.
"Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry And bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked, to cover him; And not to hide yourself from your own flesh? -- isaiah 58:7
.
"Then your light will break out like the dawn, And your recovery will speedily spring forth; And your righteousness will go before you; The glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. -- isaiah 58:8
.
"Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; You will cry, and He will say, 'Here I am.' If you remove the yoke from your midst, The pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness, -- isaiah 58:9
.
And if you give yourself to the hungry And satisfy the desire of the afflicted, Then your light will rise in darkness And your gloom will become like midday. -- isaiah 58:10
.
"And the LORD will continually guide you, And satisfy your desire in scorched places, And give strength to your bones; And you will be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail. -- isaiah 58:11
.
"Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins; You will raise up the age-old foundations; And you will be called the repairer of the breach, The restorer of the streets in which to dwell. -- isaiah 58:12
.
"If because of the sabbath, you turn your foot From doing your own pleasure on My holy day, And call the sabbath a delight, the holy day of the LORD honorable, And honor it, desisting from your own ways, From seeking your own pleasure And speaking your own word, -- isaiah 58:13
.
Then you will take delight in the LORD, And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; And I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, For the mouth of the LORD has spoken." -- isaiah 58:14
.
Behold, the LORD'S hand is not so short That it cannot save; Nor is His ear so dull That it cannot hear. -- isaiah 59:1
.
But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear. -- isaiah 59:2
.
For your hands are defiled with blood And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your tongue mutters wickedness. -- isaiah 59:3
.
No one sues righteously and no one pleads honestly. They trust in confusion and speak lies; They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity. -- isaiah 59:4
.
They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; He who eats of their eggs dies, And from that which is crushed a snake breaks forth. -- isaiah 59:5
.
Their webs will not become clothing, Nor will they cover themselves with their works; Their works are works of iniquity, And an act of violence is in their hands. -- isaiah 59:6
.
Their feet run to evil, And they hasten to shed innocent blood; Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, Devastation and destruction are in their highways. -- isaiah 59:7
.
They do not know the way of peace, And there is no justice in their tracks; They have made their paths crooked, Whoever treads on them does not know peace. -- isaiah 59:8
.
Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not overtake us; We hope for light, but behold, darkness, For brightness, but we walk in gloom. -- isaiah 59:9
.
We grope along the wall like blind men, We grope like those who have no eyes; We stumble at midday as in the twilight, Among those who are vigorous we are like dead men. -- isaiah 59:10
.
All of us growl like bears, And moan sadly like doves; We hope for justice, but there is none, For salvation, but it is far from us. -- isaiah 59:11
.
For our transgressions are multiplied before You, And our sins testify against us; For our transgressions are with us, And we know our iniquities: -- isaiah 59:12
.
Transgressing and denying the LORD, And turning away from our God, Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving in and uttering from the heart lying words. -- isaiah 59:13
.
Justice is turned back, And righteousness stands far away; For truth has stumbled in the street, And uprightness cannot enter. -- isaiah 59:14
.
Yes, truth is lacking; And he who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey. Now the LORD saw, And it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice. -- isaiah 59:15
.
And He saw that there was no man, And was astonished that there was no one to intercede; Then His own arm brought salvation to Him, And His righteousness upheld Him. -- isaiah 59:16
.
He put on righteousness like a breastplate, And a helmet of salvation on His head; And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle. -- isaiah 59:17
.
According to their deeds, so He will repay, Wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; To the coastlands He will make recompense. -- isaiah 59:18
.
So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west And His glory from the rising of the sun, For He will come like a rushing stream Which the wind of the LORD drives. -- isaiah 59:19
.
"A Redeemer will come to Zion, And to those who turn from transgression in Jacob," declares the LORD. -- isaiah 59:20
.
"As for Me, this is My covenant with them," says the LORD: "My Spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring's offspring," says the LORD, "from now and forever." -- isaiah 59:21
.
"Arise, shine; for your light has come, And the glory of the LORD has risen upon you. -- isaiah 60:1
.
"For behold, darkness will cover the earth And deep darkness the peoples; But the LORD will rise upon you And His glory will appear upon you. -- isaiah 60:2
.
"Nations will come to your light, And kings to the brightness of your rising. -- isaiah 60:3
.
"Lift up your eyes round about and see; They all gather together, they come to you. Your sons will come from afar, And your daughters will be carried in the arms. -- isaiah 60:4
.
"Then you will see and be radiant, And your heart will thrill and rejoice; Because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you, The wealth of the nations will come to you. -- isaiah 60:5
.
"A multitude of camels will cover you, The young camels of Midian and Ephah; All those from Sheba will come; They will bring gold and frankincense, And will bear good news of the praises of the LORD. -- isaiah 60:6
.
"All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you, The rams of Nebaioth will minister to you; They will go up with acceptance on My altar, And I shall glorify My glorious house. -- isaiah 60:7
.
"Who are these who fly like a cloud And like the doves to their lattices? -- isaiah 60:8
.
"Surely the coastlands will wait for Me; And the ships of Tarshish will come first, To bring your sons from afar, Their silver and their gold with them, For the name of the LORD your God, And for the Holy One of Israel because He has glorified you. -- isaiah 60:9
.
"Foreigners will build up your walls, And their kings will minister to you; For in My wrath I struck you, And in My favor I have had compassion on you. -- isaiah 60:10
.
"Your gates will be open continually; They will not be closed day or night, So that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, With their kings led in procession. -- isaiah 60:11
.
"For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve you will perish, And the nations will be utterly ruined. -- isaiah 60:12
.
"The glory of Lebanon will come to you, The juniper, the box tree and the cypress together, To beautify the place of My sanctuary; And I shall make the place of My feet glorious. -- isaiah 60:13
.
"The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you, And all those who despised you will bow themselves at the soles of your feet; And they will call you the city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. -- isaiah 60:14
.
"Whereas you have been forsaken and hated With no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, A joy from generation to generation. -- isaiah 60:15
.
"You will also suck the milk of nations And suck the breast of kings; Then you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. -- isaiah 60:16
.
"Instead of bronze I will bring gold, And instead of iron I will bring silver, And instead of wood, bronze, And instead of stones, iron. And I will make peace your administrators And righteousness your overseers. -- isaiah 60:17
.
"Violence will not be heard again in your land, Nor devastation or destruction within your borders; But you will call your walls salvation, and your gates praise. -- isaiah 60:18
.
"No longer will you have the sun for light by day, Nor for brightness will the moon give you light; But you will have the LORD for an everlasting light, And your God for your glory. -- isaiah 60:19
.
"Your sun will no longer set, Nor will your moon wane; For you will have the LORD for an everlasting light, And the days of your mourning will be over. -- isaiah 60:20
.
"Then all your people will be righteous; They will possess the land forever, The branch of My planting, The work of My hands, That I may be glorified. -- isaiah 60:21
.
"The smallest one will become a clan, And the least one a mighty nation. I, the LORD, will hasten it in its time." -- isaiah 60:22
.
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners; -- isaiah 61:1
.
To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn, -- isaiah 61:2
.
To grant those who mourn in Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified. -- isaiah 61:3
.
Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins, They will raise up the former devastations; And they will repair the ruined cities, The desolations of many generations. -- isaiah 61:4
.
Strangers will stand and pasture your flocks, And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers. -- isaiah 61:5
.
But you will be called the priests of the LORD; You will be spoken of as ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of nations, And in their riches you will boast. -- isaiah 61:6
.
Instead of your shame you will have a double portion, And instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion. Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land, Everlasting joy will be theirs. -- isaiah 61:7
.
For I, the LORD, love justice, I hate robbery in the burnt offering; And I will faithfully give them their recompense And make an everlasting covenant with them. -- isaiah 61:8
.
Then their offspring will be known among the nations, And their descendants in the midst of the peoples. All who see them will recognize them Because they are the offspring whom the LORD has blessed. -- isaiah 61:9
.
I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will exult in my God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. -- isaiah 61:10
.
For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, And as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, So the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise To spring up before all the nations. -- isaiah 61:11
.
For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not keep quiet, Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, And her salvation like a torch that is burning. -- isaiah 62:1
.
The nations will see your righteousness, And all kings your glory; And you will be called by a new name Which the mouth of the LORD will designate. -- isaiah 62:2
.
You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, And a royal diadem in the hand of your God. -- isaiah 62:3
.
It will no longer be said to you, "Forsaken," Nor to your land will it any longer be said, "Desolate"; But you will be called, "My delight is in her," And your land, "Married"; For the LORD delights in you, And to Him your land will be married. -- isaiah 62:4
.
For as a young man marries a virgin, So your sons will marry you; And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, So your God will rejoice over you. -- isaiah 62:5
.
On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; All day and all night they will never keep silent. You who remind the LORD, take no rest for yourselves; -- isaiah 62:6
.
And give Him no rest until He establishes And makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. -- isaiah 62:7
.
The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His strong arm, "I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies; Nor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored." -- isaiah 62:8
.
But those who garner it will eat it and praise the LORD; And those who gather it will drink it in the courts of My sanctuary. -- isaiah 62:9
.
Go through, go through the gates, Clear the way for the people; Build up, build up the highway, Remove the stones, lift up a standard over the peoples. -- isaiah 62:10
.
Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, "Lo, your salvation comes; Behold His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him." -- isaiah 62:11
.
And they will call them, "The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD"; And you will be called, "Sought out, a city not forsaken." -- isaiah 62:12
.
Who is this who comes from Edom, With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah, This One who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the greatness of His strength? "It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save." -- isaiah 63:1
.
Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press? -- isaiah 63:2
.
"I have trodden the wine trough alone, And from the peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger And trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I stained all My raiment. -- isaiah 63:3
.
"For the day of vengeance was in My heart, And My year of redemption has come. -- isaiah 63:4
.
"I looked, and there was no one to help, And I was astonished and there was no one to uphold; So My own arm brought salvation to Me, And My wrath upheld Me. -- isaiah 63:5
.
"I trod down the peoples in My anger And made them drunk in My wrath, And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth." -- isaiah 63:6
.
I shall make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, the praises of the LORD, According to all that the LORD has granted us, And the great goodness toward the house of Israel, Which He has granted them according to His compassion And according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses. -- isaiah 63:7
.
For He said, "Surely, they are My people, Sons who will not deal falsely." So He became their Savior. -- isaiah 63:8
.
In all their affliction He was afflicted, And the angel of His presence saved them; In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them, And He lifted them and carried them all the days of old. -- isaiah 63:9
.
But they rebelled And grieved His Holy Spirit; Therefore He turned Himself to become their enemy, He fought against them. -- isaiah 63:10
.
Then His people remembered the days of old, of Moses. Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them, -- isaiah 63:11
.
Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, Who divided the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name, -- isaiah 63:12
.
Who led them through the depths? Like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble; -- isaiah 63:13
.
As the cattle which go down into the valley, The Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So You led Your people, To make for Yourself a glorious name. -- isaiah 63:14
.
Look down from heaven and see from Your holy and glorious habitation; Where are Your zeal and Your mighty deeds? The stirrings of Your heart and Your compassion are restrained toward me. -- isaiah 63:15
.
For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us And Israel does not recognize us. You, O LORD, are our Father, Our Redeemer from of old is Your name. -- isaiah 63:16
.
Why, O LORD, do You cause us to stray from Your ways And harden our heart from fearing You? Return for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage. -- isaiah 63:17
.
Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for a little while, Our adversaries have trodden it down. -- isaiah 63:18
.
We have become like those over whom You have never ruled, Like those who were not called by Your name. -- isaiah 63:19
.
Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down, That the mountains might quake at Your presence-- -- isaiah 64:1
.
As fire kindles the brushwood, as fire causes water to boil-- To make Your name known to Your adversaries, That the nations may tremble at Your presence! -- isaiah 64:2
.
When You did awesome things which we did not expect, You came down, the mountains quaked at Your presence. -- isaiah 64:3
.
For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear, Nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him. -- isaiah 64:4
.
You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness, Who remembers You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned, We continued in them a long time; And shall we be saved? -- isaiah 64:5
.
For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. -- isaiah 64:6
.
There is no one who calls on Your name, Who arouses himself to take hold of You; For You have hidden Your face from us And have delivered us into the power of our iniquities. -- isaiah 64:7
.
But now, O LORD, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand. -- isaiah 64:8
.
Do not be angry beyond measure, O LORD, Nor remember iniquity forever; Behold, look now, all of us are Your people. -- isaiah 64:9
.
Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. -- isaiah 64:10
.
Our holy and beautiful house, Where our fathers praised You, Has been burned by fire; And all our precious things have become a ruin. -- isaiah 64:11
.
Will You restrain Yourself at these things, O LORD? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure? -- isaiah 64:12
.
"I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me; I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me. I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' To a nation which did not call on My name. -- isaiah 65:1
.
"I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people, Who walk in the way which is not good, following their own thoughts, -- isaiah 65:2
.
A people who continually provoke Me to My face, Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks; -- isaiah 65:3
.
Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places; Who eat swine's flesh, And the broth of unclean meat is in their pots. -- isaiah 65:4
.
"Who say, 'Keep to yourself, do not come near me, For I am holier than you!' These are smoke in My nostrils, A fire that burns all the day. -- isaiah 65:5
.
"Behold, it is written before Me, I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will even repay into their bosom, -- isaiah 65:6
.
Both their own iniquities and the iniquities of their fathers together," says the LORD. "Because they have burned incense on the mountains And scorned Me on the hills, Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom." -- isaiah 65:7
.
Thus says the LORD, "As the new wine is found in the cluster, And one says, 'Do not destroy it, for there is benefit in it,' So I will act on behalf of My servants In order not to destroy all of them. -- isaiah 65:8
.
"I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, And an heir of My mountains from Judah; Even My chosen ones shall inherit it, And My servants will dwell there. -- isaiah 65:9
.
"Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks, And the valley of Achor a resting place for herds, For My people who seek Me. -- isaiah 65:10
.
"But you who forsake the LORD, Who forget My holy mountain, Who set a table for Fortune, And who fill cups with mixed wine for Destiny, -- isaiah 65:11
.
I will destine you for the sword, And all of you will bow down to the slaughter. Because I called, but you did not answer; I spoke, but you did not hear. And you did evil in My sight And chose that in which I did not delight." -- isaiah 65:12
.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame. -- isaiah 65:13
.
"Behold, My servants will shout joyfully with a glad heart, But you will cry out with a heavy heart, And you will wail with a broken spirit. -- isaiah 65:14
.
"You will leave your name for a curse to My chosen ones, And the Lord GOD will slay you. But My servants will be called by another name. -- isaiah 65:15
.
"Because he who is blessed in the earth Will be blessed by the God of truth; And he who swears in the earth Will swear by the God of truth; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hidden from My sight! -- isaiah 65:16
.
"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; And the former things will not be remembered or come to mind. -- isaiah 65:17
.
"But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing And her people for gladness. -- isaiah 65:18
.
"I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people; And there will no longer be heard in her The voice of weeping and the sound of crying. -- isaiah 65:19
.
"No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, Or an old man who does not live out his days; For the youth will die at the age of one hundred And the one who does not reach the age of one hundred Will be thought accursed. -- isaiah 65:20
.
"They will build houses and inhabit them; They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit. -- isaiah 65:21
.
"They will not build and another inhabit, They will not plant and another eat; For as the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people, And My chosen ones will wear out the work of their hands. -- isaiah 65:22
.
"They will not labor in vain, Or bear children for calamity; For they are the offspring of those blessed by the LORD, And their descendants with them. -- isaiah 65:23
.
"It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear. -- isaiah 65:24
.
"The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent's food. They will do no evil or harm in all My holy mountain," says the LORD. -- isaiah 65:25
.
Thus says the LORD, "Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool. Where then is a house you could build for Me? And where is a place that I may rest? -- isaiah 66:1
.
"For My hand made all these things, Thus all these things came into being," declares the LORD. "But to this one I will look, To him who is humble and contrite of spirit, and who trembles at My word. -- isaiah 66:2
.
"But he who kills an ox is like one who slays a man; He who sacrifices a lamb is like the one who breaks a dog's neck; He who offers a grain offering is like one who offers swine's blood; He who burns incense is like the one who blesses an idol. As they have chosen their own ways, And their soul delights in their abominations, -- isaiah 66:3
.
So I will choose their punishments And will bring on them what they dread. Because I called, but no one answered; I spoke, but they did not listen. And they did evil in My sight And chose that in which I did not delight." -- isaiah 66:4
.
Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at His word: "Your brothers who hate you, who exclude you for My name's sake, Have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy.' But they will be put to shame. -- isaiah 66:5
.
"A voice of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple, The voice of the LORD who is rendering recompense to His enemies. -- isaiah 66:6
.
"Before she travailed, she brought forth; Before her pain came, she gave birth to a boy. -- isaiah 66:7
.
"Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day? Can a nation be brought forth all at once? As soon as Zion travailed, she also brought forth her sons. -- isaiah 66:8
.
"Shall I bring to the point of birth and not give delivery?" says the LORD. "Or shall I who gives delivery shut the womb?" says your God. -- isaiah 66:9
.
"Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her; Be exceedingly glad with her, all you who mourn over her, -- isaiah 66:10
.
That you may nurse and be satisfied with her comforting breasts, That you may suck and be delighted with her bountiful bosom." -- isaiah 66:11
.
For thus says the LORD, "Behold, I extend peace to her like a river, And the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; And you will be nursed, you will be carried on the hip and fondled on the knees. -- isaiah 66:12
.
"As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; And you will be comforted in Jerusalem." -- isaiah 66:13
.
Then you will see this, and your heart will be glad, And your bones will flourish like the new grass; And the hand of the LORD will be made known to His servants, But He will be indignant toward His enemies. -- isaiah 66:14
.
For behold, the LORD will come in fire And His chariots like the whirlwind, To render His anger with fury, And His rebuke with flames of fire. -- isaiah 66:15
.
For the LORD will execute judgment by fire And by His sword on all flesh, And those slain by the LORD will be many. -- isaiah 66:16
.
"Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go to the gardens, Following one in the center, Who eat swine's flesh, detestable things and mice, Will come to an end altogether," declares the LORD. -- isaiah 66:17
.
"For I know their works and their thoughts; the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and see My glory. -- isaiah 66:18
.
"I will set a sign among them and will send survivors from them to the nations: Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have neither heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations. -- isaiah 66:19
.
"Then they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as a grain offering to the LORD, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem," says the LORD, "just as the sons of Israel bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD. -- isaiah 66:20
.
"I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites," says the LORD. -- isaiah 66:21
.
"For just as the new heavens and the new earth Which I make will endure before Me," declares the LORD, "So your offspring and your name will endure. -- isaiah 66:22
.
"And it shall be from new moon to new moon And from sabbath to sabbath, All mankind will come to bow down before Me," says the LORD. -- isaiah 66:23
.
"Then they will go forth and look On the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm will not die And their fire will not be quenched; And they will be an abhorrence to all mankind." -- isaiah 66:24
.
The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, -- jeremiah 1:1
.
to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. -- jeremiah 1:2
.
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month. -- jeremiah 1:3
.
Now the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- jeremiah 1:4
.
"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations." -- jeremiah 1:5
.
Then I said, "Alas, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, Because I am a youth." -- jeremiah 1:6
.
But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am a youth,' Because everywhere I send you, you shall go, And all that I command you, you shall speak. -- jeremiah 1:7
.
"Do not be afraid of them, For I am with you to deliver you," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 1:8
.
Then the LORD stretched out His hand and touched my mouth, and the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put My words in your mouth. -- jeremiah 1:9
.
"See, I have appointed you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, To pluck up and to break down, To destroy and to overthrow, To build and to plant." -- jeremiah 1:10
.
The word of the LORD came to me saying, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "I see a rod of an almond tree." -- jeremiah 1:11
.
Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over My word to perform it." -- jeremiah 1:12
.
The word of the LORD came to me a second time saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north." -- jeremiah 1:13
.
Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north the evil will break forth on all the inhabitants of the land. -- jeremiah 1:14
.
"For, behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north," declares the LORD; "and they will come and they will set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls round about and against all the cities of Judah. -- jeremiah 1:15
.
"I will pronounce My judgments on them concerning all their wickedness, whereby they have forsaken Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands. -- jeremiah 1:16
.
"Now, gird up your loins and arise, and speak to them all which I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, or I will dismay you before them. -- jeremiah 1:17
.
"Now behold, I have made you today as a fortified city and as a pillar of iron and as walls of bronze against the whole land, to the kings of Judah, to its princes, to its priests and to the people of the land. -- jeremiah 1:18
.
"They will fight against you, but they will not overcome you, for I am with you to deliver you," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 1:19
.
Now the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- jeremiah 2:1
.
"Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "I remember concerning you the devotion of your youth, The love of your betrothals, Your following after Me in the wilderness, Through a land not sown. -- jeremiah 2:2
.
"Israel was holy to the LORD, The first of His harvest. All who ate of it became guilty; Evil came upon them," declares the LORD.'" -- jeremiah 2:3
.
Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel. -- jeremiah 2:4
.
Thus says the LORD, "What injustice did your fathers find in Me, That they went far from Me And walked after emptiness and became empty? -- jeremiah 2:5
.
"They did not say, 'Where is the LORD Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and of pits, Through a land of drought and of deep darkness, Through a land that no one crossed And where no man dwelt?' -- jeremiah 2:6
.
"I brought you into the fruitful land To eat its fruit and its good things. But you came and defiled My land, And My inheritance you made an abomination. -- jeremiah 2:7
.
"The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' And those who handle the law did not know Me; The rulers also transgressed against Me, And the prophets prophesied by Baal And walked after things that did not profit. -- jeremiah 2:8
.
"Therefore I will yet contend with you," declares the LORD, "And with your sons' sons I will contend. -- jeremiah 2:9
.
"For cross to the coastlands of Kittim and see, And send to Kedar and observe closely And see if there has been such a thing as this! -- jeremiah 2:10
.
"Has a nation changed gods When they were not gods? But My people have changed their glory For that which does not profit. -- jeremiah 2:11
.
"Be appalled, O heavens, at this, And shudder, be very desolate," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 2:12
.
"For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, The fountain of living waters, To hew for themselves cisterns, Broken cisterns That can hold no water. -- jeremiah 2:13
.
"Is Israel a slave? Or is he a homeborn servant? Why has he become a prey? -- jeremiah 2:14
.
"The young lions have roared at him, They have roared loudly. And they have made his land a waste; His cities have been destroyed, without inhabitant. -- jeremiah 2:15
.
"Also the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes Have shaved the crown of your head. -- jeremiah 2:16
.
"Have you not done this to yourself By your forsaking the LORD your God When He led you in the way? -- jeremiah 2:17
.
"But now what are you doing on the road to Egypt, To drink the waters of the Nile? Or what are you doing on the road to Assyria, To drink the waters of the Euphrates? -- jeremiah 2:18
.
"Your own wickedness will correct you, And your apostasies will reprove you; Know therefore and see that it is evil and bitter For you to forsake the LORD your God, And the dread of Me is not in you," declares the Lord GOD of hosts. -- jeremiah 2:19
.
"For long ago I broke your yoke And tore off your bonds; But you said, 'I will not serve!' For on every high hill And under every green tree You have lain down as a harlot. -- jeremiah 2:20
.
"Yet I planted you a choice vine, A completely faithful seed. How then have you turned yourself before Me Into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine? -- jeremiah 2:21
.
"Although you wash yourself with lye And use much soap, The stain of your iniquity is before Me," declares the Lord GOD. -- jeremiah 2:22
.
"How can you say, 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley! Know what you have done! You are a swift young camel entangling her ways, -- jeremiah 2:23
.
A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, That sniffs the wind in her passion. In the time of her heat who can turn her away? All who seek her will not become weary; In her month they will find her. -- jeremiah 2:24
.
"Keep your feet from being unshod And your throat from thirst; But you said, 'It is hopeless! No! For I have loved strangers, And after them I will walk.' -- jeremiah 2:25
.
"As the thief is shamed when he is discovered, So the house of Israel is shamed; They, their kings, their princes And their priests and their prophets, -- jeremiah 2:26
.
Who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' And to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to Me, And not their face; But in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise and save us.' -- jeremiah 2:27
.
"But where are your gods Which you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you In the time of your trouble; For according to the number of your cities Are your gods, O Judah. -- jeremiah 2:28
.
"Why do you contend with Me? You have all transgressed against Me," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 2:29
.
"In vain I have struck your sons; They accepted no chastening. Your sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion. -- jeremiah 2:30
.
"O generation, heed the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, Or a land of thick darkness? Why do My people say, 'We are free to roam; We will no longer come to You'? -- jeremiah 2:31
.
"Can a virgin forget her ornaments, Or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me Days without number. -- jeremiah 2:32
.
"How well you prepare your way To seek love! Therefore even the wicked women You have taught your ways. -- jeremiah 2:33
.
"Also on your skirts is found The lifeblood of the innocent poor; You did not find them breaking in. But in spite of all these things, -- jeremiah 2:34
.
Yet you said, 'I am innocent; Surely His anger is turned away from me.' Behold, I will enter into judgment with you Because you say, 'I have not sinned.' -- jeremiah 2:35
.
"Why do you go around so much Changing your way? Also, you will be put to shame by Egypt As you were put to shame by Assyria. -- jeremiah 2:36
.
"From this place also you will go out With your hands on your head; For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, And you will not prosper with them." -- jeremiah 2:37
.
God says, "If a husband divorces his wife And she goes from him And belongs to another man, Will he still return to her? Will not that land be completely polluted? But you are a harlot with many lovers; Yet you turn to Me," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 3:1
.
"Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see; Where have you not been violated? By the roads you have sat for them Like an Arab in the desert, And you have polluted a land With your harlotry and with your wickedness. -- jeremiah 3:2
.
"Therefore the showers have been withheld, And there has been no spring rain. Yet you had a harlot's forehead; You refused to be ashamed. -- jeremiah 3:3
.
"Have you not just now called to Me, 'My Father, You are the friend of my youth? -- jeremiah 3:4
.
'Will He be angry forever? Will He be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken And have done evil things, And you have had your way." -- jeremiah 3:5
.
Then the LORD said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen what faithless Israel did? She went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and she was a harlot there. -- jeremiah 3:6
.
"I thought, 'After she has done all these things she will return to Me'; but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. -- jeremiah 3:7
.
"And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear; but she went and was a harlot also. -- jeremiah 3:8
.
"Because of the lightness of her harlotry, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. -- jeremiah 3:9
.
"Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but rather in deception," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 3:10
.
And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. -- jeremiah 3:11
.
"Go and proclaim these words toward the north and say, 'Return, faithless Israel,' declares the LORD; 'I will not look upon you in anger. For I am gracious,' declares the LORD; 'I will not be angry forever. -- jeremiah 3:12
.
'Only acknowledge your iniquity, That you have transgressed against the LORD your God And have scattered your favors to the strangers under every green tree, And you have not obeyed My voice,' declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 3:13
.
'Return, O faithless sons,' declares the LORD; 'For I am a master to you, And I will take you one from a city and two from a family, And I will bring you to Zion.' -- jeremiah 3:14
.
"Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding. -- jeremiah 3:15
.
"It shall be in those days when you are multiplied and increased in the land," declares the LORD, "they will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD.' And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it, nor will they miss it, nor will it be made again. -- jeremiah 3:16
.
"At that time they will call Jerusalem 'The Throne of the LORD,' and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Jerusalem, for the name of the LORD; nor will they walk anymore after the stubbornness of their evil heart. -- jeremiah 3:17
.
"In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance. -- jeremiah 3:18
.
"Then I said, 'How I would set you among My sons And give you a pleasant land, The most beautiful inheritance of the nations!' And I said, 'You shall call Me, My Father, And not turn away from following Me.' -- jeremiah 3:19
.
"Surely, as a woman treacherously departs from her lover, So you have dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 3:20
.
A voice is heard on the bare heights, The weeping and the supplications of the sons of Israel; Because they have perverted their way, They have forgotten the LORD their God. -- jeremiah 3:21
.
"Return, O faithless sons, I will heal your faithlessness." "Behold, we come to You; For You are the LORD our God. -- jeremiah 3:22
.
"Surely, the hills are a deception, A tumult on the mountains. Surely in the LORD our God Is the salvation of Israel. -- jeremiah 3:23
.
"But the shameful thing has consumed the labor of our fathers since our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. -- jeremiah 3:24
.
"Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. And we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God." -- jeremiah 3:25
.
"If you will return, O Israel," declares the LORD, "Then you should return to Me. And if you will put away your detested things from My presence, And will not waver, -- jeremiah 4:1
.
And you will swear, 'As the LORD lives,' In truth, in justice and in righteousness; Then the nations will bless themselves in Him, And in Him they will glory." -- jeremiah 4:2
.
For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, "Break up your fallow ground, And do not sow among thorns. -- jeremiah 4:3
.
"Circumcise yourselves to the LORD And remove the foreskins of your heart, Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Or else My wrath will go forth like fire And burn with none to quench it, Because of the evil of your deeds." -- jeremiah 4:4
.
Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet in the land; Cry aloud and say, 'Assemble yourselves, and let us go Into the fortified cities.' -- jeremiah 4:5
.
"Lift up a standard toward Zion! Seek refuge, do not stand still, For I am bringing evil from the north, And great destruction. -- jeremiah 4:6
.
"A lion has gone up from his thicket, And a destroyer of nations has set out; He has gone out from his place To make your land a waste. Your cities will be ruins Without inhabitant. -- jeremiah 4:7
.
"For this, put on sackcloth, Lament and wail; For the fierce anger of the LORD Has not turned back from us." -- jeremiah 4:8
.
"It shall come about in that day," declares the LORD, "that the heart of the king and the heart of the princes will fail; and the priests will be appalled and the prophets will be astounded." -- jeremiah 4:9
.
Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Surely You have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'You will have peace'; whereas a sword touches the throat." -- jeremiah 4:10
.
In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A scorching wind from the bare heights in the wilderness in the direction of the daughter of My people--not to winnow and not to cleanse, -- jeremiah 4:11
.
a wind too strong for this--will come at My command; now I will also pronounce judgments against them. -- jeremiah 4:12
.
"Behold, he goes up like clouds, And his chariots like the whirlwind; His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!" -- jeremiah 4:13
.
Wash your heart from evil, O Jerusalem, That you may be saved. How long will your wicked thoughts Lodge within you? -- jeremiah 4:14
.
For a voice declares from Dan, And proclaims wickedness from Mount Ephraim. -- jeremiah 4:15
.
"Report it to the nations, now! Proclaim over Jerusalem, 'Besiegers come from a far country, And lift their voices against the cities of Judah. -- jeremiah 4:16
.
'Like watchmen of a field they are against her round about, Because she has rebelled against Me,' declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 4:17
.
"Your ways and your deeds Have brought these things to you. This is your evil. How bitter! How it has touched your heart!" -- jeremiah 4:18
.
My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart! My heart is pounding in me; I cannot be silent, Because you have heard, O my soul, The sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war. -- jeremiah 4:19
.
Disaster on disaster is proclaimed, For the whole land is devastated; Suddenly my tents are devastated, My curtains in an instant. -- jeremiah 4:20
.
How long must I see the standard And hear the sound of the trumpet? -- jeremiah 4:21
.
"For My people are foolish, They know Me not; They are stupid children And have no understanding. They are shrewd to do evil, But to do good they do not know." -- jeremiah 4:22
.
I looked on the earth, and behold, it was formless and void; And to the heavens, and they had no light. -- jeremiah 4:23
.
I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, And all the hills moved to and fro. -- jeremiah 4:24
.
I looked, and behold, there was no man, And all the birds of the heavens had fled. -- jeremiah 4:25
.
I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness, And all its cities were pulled down Before the LORD, before His fierce anger. -- jeremiah 4:26
.
For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation, Yet I will not execute a complete destruction. -- jeremiah 4:27
.
"For this the earth shall mourn And the heavens above be dark, Because I have spoken, I have purposed, And I will not change My mind, nor will I turn from it." -- jeremiah 4:28
.
At the sound of the horseman and bowman every city flees; They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks; Every city is forsaken, And no man dwells in them. -- jeremiah 4:29
.
And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Although you dress in scarlet, Although you decorate yourself with ornaments of gold, Although you enlarge your eyes with paint, In vain you make yourself beautiful. Your lovers despise you; They seek your life. -- jeremiah 4:30
.
For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, The anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, The cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, Stretching out her hands, saying, "Ah, woe is me, for I faint before murderers." -- jeremiah 4:31
.
"Roam to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, And look now and take note. And seek in her open squares, If you can find a man, If there is one who does justice, who seeks truth, Then I will pardon her. -- jeremiah 5:1
.
"And although they say, 'As the LORD lives,' Surely they swear falsely." -- jeremiah 5:2
.
O LORD, do not Your eyes look for truth? You have smitten them, But they did not weaken; You have consumed them, But they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; They have refused to repent. -- jeremiah 5:3
.
Then I said, "They are only the poor, They are foolish; For they do not know the way of the LORD Or the ordinance of their God. -- jeremiah 5:4
.
"I will go to the great And will speak to them, For they know the way of the LORD And the ordinance of their God." But they too, with one accord, have broken the yoke And burst the bonds. -- jeremiah 5:5
.
Therefore a lion from the forest will slay them, A wolf of the deserts will destroy them, A leopard is watching their cities. Everyone who goes out of them will be torn in pieces, Because their transgressions are many, Their apostasies are numerous. -- jeremiah 5:6
.
"Why should I pardon you? Your sons have forsaken Me And sworn by those who are not gods. When I had fed them to the full, They committed adultery And trooped to the harlot's house. -- jeremiah 5:7
.
"They were well-fed lusty horses, Each one neighing after his neighbor's wife. -- jeremiah 5:8
.
"Shall I not punish these people," declares the LORD, "And on a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself? -- jeremiah 5:9
.
"Go up through her vine rows and destroy, But do not execute a complete destruction; Strip away her branches, For they are not the LORD'S. -- jeremiah 5:10
.
"For the house of Israel and the house of Judah Have dealt very treacherously with Me," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 5:11
.
They have lied about the LORD And said, "Not He; Misfortune will not come on us, And we will not see sword or famine. -- jeremiah 5:12
.
"The prophets are as wind, And the word is not in them. Thus it will be done to them!" -- jeremiah 5:13
.
Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, "Because you have spoken this word, Behold, I am making My words in your mouth fire And this people wood, and it will consume them. -- jeremiah 5:14
.
"Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel," declares the LORD. "It is an enduring nation, It is an ancient nation, A nation whose language you do not know, Nor can you understand what they say. -- jeremiah 5:15
.
"Their quiver is like an open grave, All of them are mighty men. -- jeremiah 5:16
.
"They will devour your harvest and your food; They will devour your sons and your daughters; They will devour your flocks and your herds; They will devour your vines and your fig trees; They will demolish with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust. -- jeremiah 5:17
.
"Yet even in those days," declares the LORD, "I will not make you a complete destruction. -- jeremiah 5:18
.
"It shall come about when they say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' then you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.' -- jeremiah 5:19
.
"Declare this in the house of Jacob And proclaim it in Judah, saying, -- jeremiah 5:20
.
'Now hear this, O foolish and senseless people, Who have eyes but do not see; Who have ears but do not hear. -- jeremiah 5:21
.
'Do you not fear Me?' declares the LORD. 'Do you not tremble in My presence? For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, An eternal decree, so it cannot cross over it. Though the waves toss, yet they cannot prevail; Though they roar, yet they cannot cross over it. -- jeremiah 5:22
.
'But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; They have turned aside and departed. -- jeremiah 5:23
.
'They do not say in their heart, "Let us now fear the LORD our God, Who gives rain in its season, Both the autumn rain and the spring rain, Who keeps for us The appointed weeks of the harvest." -- jeremiah 5:24
.
'Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have withheld good from you. -- jeremiah 5:25
.
'For wicked men are found among My people, They watch like fowlers lying in wait; They set a trap, They catch men. -- jeremiah 5:26
.
'Like a cage full of birds, So their houses are full of deceit; Therefore they have become great and rich. -- jeremiah 5:27
.
'They are fat, they are sleek, They also excel in deeds of wickedness; They do not plead the cause, The cause of the orphan, that they may prosper; And they do not defend the rights of the poor. -- jeremiah 5:28

.
"Arise, and let us attack by night And destroy her palaces!" -- jeremiah 6:5

For thus says the LORD of hosts, "Cut down her trees And cast up a siege against Jerusalem. This is the city to be punished, In whose midst there is only oppression. -- jeremiah 6:6
.
"As a well keeps its waters fresh, So she keeps fresh her wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard in her; Sickness and wounds are ever before Me. -- jeremiah 6:7
.
"Be warned, O Jerusalem, Or I shall be alienated from you, And make you a desolation, A land not inhabited." -- jeremiah 6:8
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, "They will thoroughly glean as the vine the remnant of Israel; Pass your hand again like a grape gatherer Over the branches." -- jeremiah 6:9
.
To whom shall I speak and give warning That they may hear? Behold, their ears are closed And they cannot listen. Behold, the word of the LORD has become a reproach to them; They have no delight in it. -- jeremiah 6:10
.
But I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary with holding it in. "Pour it out on the children in the street And on the gathering of young men together; For both husband and wife shall be taken, The aged and the very old. -- jeremiah 6:11
.
"Their houses shall be turned over to others, Their fields and their wives together; For I will stretch out My hand Against the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 6:12

.
Thus says the LORD, "Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, Where the good way is, and walk in it; And you will find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.' -- jeremiah 6:16
.
"And I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not listen.' -- jeremiah 6:17

Thus says the LORD, "Behold, a people is coming from the north land, And a great nation will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth. -- jeremiah 6:22
.
"They seize bow and spear; They are cruel and have no mercy; Their voice roars like the sea, And they ride on horses, Arrayed as a man for the battle Against you, O daughter of Zion!" -- jeremiah 6:23
.
We have heard the report of it; Our hands are limp. Anguish has seized us, Pain as of a woman in childbirth. -- jeremiah 6:24
.
Do not go out into the field And do not walk on the road, For the enemy has a sword, Terror is on every side. -- jeremiah 6:25

.
"I have made you an assayer and a tester among My people, That you may know and assay their way." -- jeremiah 6:27
.
All of them are stubbornly rebellious, Going about as a talebearer. They are bronze and iron; They, all of them, are corrupt. -- jeremiah 6:28
.
The bellows blow fiercely, The lead is consumed by the fire; In vain the refining goes on, But the wicked are not separated. -- jeremiah 6:29
.
They call them rejected silver, Because the LORD has rejected them. -- jeremiah 6:30
.
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, -- jeremiah 7:1
.
"Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house and proclaim there this word and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, who enter by these gates to worship the LORD!'" -- jeremiah 7:2
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place. -- jeremiah 7:3
.
"Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.' -- jeremiah 7:4
.
"For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly practice justice between a man and his neighbor, -- jeremiah 7:5
.
if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own ruin, -- jeremiah 7:6
.
then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever. -- jeremiah 7:7
.
"Behold, you are trusting in deceptive words to no avail. -- jeremiah 7:8
.
"Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery and swear falsely, and offer sacrifices to Baal and walk after other gods that you have not known, -- jeremiah 7:9
.
then come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, and say, 'We are delivered!'--that you may do all these abominations? -- jeremiah 7:10
.
"Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Behold, I, even I, have seen it," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 7:11
.
"But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at the first, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. -- jeremiah 7:12
.
"And now, because you have done all these things," declares the LORD, "and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I called you but you did not answer, -- jeremiah 7:13
.
therefore, I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. -- jeremiah 7:14
.
"I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, all the offspring of Ephraim. -- jeremiah 7:15

.
"Do they spite Me?" declares the LORD. "Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?" -- jeremiah 7:19
.
Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and on beast and on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and not be quenched." -- jeremiah 7:20
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh. -- jeremiah 7:21
.
"For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. -- jeremiah 7:22
.
"But this is what I commanded them, saying, 'Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and you will walk in all the way which I command you, that it may be well with you.' -- jeremiah 7:23
.
"Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward. -- jeremiah 7:24
.
"Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them. -- jeremiah 7:25
.
"Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did more evil than their fathers. -- jeremiah 7:26
.
"You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you. -- jeremiah 7:27
.
"You shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God or accept correction; truth has perished and has been cut off from their mouth. -- jeremiah 7:28
.
'Cut off your hair and cast it away, And take up a lamentation on the bare heights; For the LORD has rejected and forsaken The generation of His wrath.' -- jeremiah 7:29
.
"For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight," declares the LORD, "they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. -- jeremiah 7:30
.
"They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind. -- jeremiah 7:31
.
"Therefore, behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place. -- jeremiah 7:32
.
"The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away. -- jeremiah 7:33
.
"Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin. -- jeremiah 7:34
.
"At that time," declares the LORD, "they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of its princes, and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves. -- jeremiah 8:1
.
"They will spread them out to the sun, the moon and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served, and which they have gone after and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the ground. -- jeremiah 8:2
.
"And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family, that remains in all the places to which I have driven them," declares the LORD of hosts. -- jeremiah 8:3
.
"You shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "Do men fall and not get up again? Does one turn away and not repent? -- jeremiah 8:4
.
"Why then has this people, Jerusalem, Turned away in continual apostasy? They hold fast to deceit, They refuse to return. -- jeremiah 8:5
.
"I have listened and heard, They have spoken what is not right; No man repented of his wickedness, Saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone turned to his course, Like a horse charging into the battle. -- jeremiah 8:6
.
"Even the stork in the sky Knows her seasons; And the turtledove and the swift and the thrush Observe the time of their migration; But My people do not know The ordinance of the LORD. -- jeremiah 8:7
.
"How can you say, 'We are wise, And the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes Has made it into a lie. -- jeremiah 8:8
.
"The wise men are put to shame, They are dismayed and caught; Behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, And what kind of wisdom do they have? -- jeremiah 8:9
.
"Therefore I will give their wives to others, Their fields to new owners; Because from the least even to the greatest Everyone is greedy for gain; From the prophet even to the priest Everyone practices deceit. -- jeremiah 8:10
.
"They heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially, Saying, 'Peace, peace,' But there is no peace. -- jeremiah 8:11
.
"Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done? They certainly were not ashamed, And they did not know how to blush; Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the time of their punishment they shall be brought down," Says the LORD. -- jeremiah 8:12
.
"I will surely snatch them away," declares the LORD; "There will be no grapes on the vine And no figs on the fig tree, And the leaf will wither; And what I have given them will pass away."'" -- jeremiah 8:13
.
Why are we sitting still? Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities And let us perish there, Because the LORD our God has doomed us And given us poisoned water to drink, For we have sinned against the LORD. -- jeremiah 8:14
.
We waited for peace, but no good came; For a time of healing, but behold, terror! -- jeremiah 8:15
.
From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses; At the sound of the neighing of his stallions The whole land quakes; For they come and devour the land and its fullness, The city and its inhabitants. -- jeremiah 8:16
.
"For behold, I am sending serpents against you, Adders, for which there is no charm, And they will bite you," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 8:17
.
My sorrow is beyond healing, My heart is faint within me! -- jeremiah 8:18
.
Behold, listen! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land: "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not within her?" "Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign idols?" -- jeremiah 8:19
.
"Harvest is past, summer is ended, And we are not saved." -- jeremiah 8:20
.
For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken; I mourn, dismay has taken hold of me. -- jeremiah 8:21
.
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored? -- jeremiah 8:22
.
Oh that my head were waters And my eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my people! -- jeremiah 9:1
.
Oh that I had in the desert A wayfarers' lodging place; That I might leave my people And go from them! For all of them are adulterers, An assembly of treacherous men. -- jeremiah 9:2
.
"They bend their tongue like their bow; Lies and not truth prevail in the land; For they proceed from evil to evil, And they do not know Me," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 9:3
.
"Let everyone be on guard against his neighbor, And do not trust any brother; Because every brother deals craftily, And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer. -- jeremiah 9:4
.
"Everyone deceives his neighbor And does not speak the truth, They have taught their tongue to speak lies; They weary themselves committing iniquity. -- jeremiah 9:5
.
"Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; Through deceit they refuse to know Me," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 9:6
.
Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, I will refine them and assay them; For what else can I do, because of the daughter of My people? -- jeremiah 9:7
.
"Their tongue is a deadly arrow; It speaks deceit; With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, But inwardly he sets an ambush for him. -- jeremiah 9:8
.
"Shall I not punish them for these things?" declares the LORD. "On a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself? -- jeremiah 9:9
.
"For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing, And for the pastures of the wilderness a dirge, Because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, And the lowing of the cattle is not heard; Both the birds of the sky and the beasts have fled; they are gone. -- jeremiah 9:10
.
"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, A haunt of jackals; And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant." -- jeremiah 9:11
.
Who is the wise man that may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert, so that no one passes through? -- jeremiah 9:12
.
The LORD said, "Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice nor walked according to it, -- jeremiah 9:13
.
but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them," -- jeremiah 9:14
.
therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink. -- jeremiah 9:15
.
"I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them." -- jeremiah 9:16
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come; And send for the wailing women, that they may come! -- jeremiah 9:17
.
"Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us, That our eyes may shed tears And our eyelids flow with water. -- jeremiah 9:18
.
"For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion, 'How are we ruined! We are put to great shame, For we have left the land, Because they have cast down our dwellings.'" -- jeremiah 9:19
.
Now hear the word of the LORD, O you women, And let your ear receive the word of His mouth; Teach your daughters wailing, And everyone her neighbor a dirge. -- jeremiah 9:20
.
For death has come up through our windows; It has entered our palaces To cut off the children from the streets, The young men from the town squares. -- jeremiah 9:21
.
Speak, "Thus says the LORD, 'The corpses of men will fall like dung on the open field, And like the sheaf after the reaper, But no one will gather them.'" -- jeremiah 9:22
.
Thus says the LORD, "Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches; -- jeremiah 9:23
.
but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 9:24
.
"Behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "that I will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised-- -- jeremiah 9:25
.
Egypt and Judah, and Edom and the sons of Ammon, and Moab and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart." -- jeremiah 9:26
.
Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel. -- jeremiah 10:1
.
Thus says the LORD, "Do not learn the way of the nations, And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens Although the nations are terrified by them; -- jeremiah 10:2
.
For the customs of the peoples are delusion; Because it is wood cut from the forest, The work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool. -- jeremiah 10:3
.
"They decorate it with silver and with gold; They fasten it with nails and with hammers So that it will not totter. -- jeremiah 10:4
.
"Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they, And they cannot speak; They must be carried, Because they cannot walk! Do not fear them, For they can do no harm, Nor can they do any good." -- jeremiah 10:5
.
There is none like You, O LORD; You are great, and great is Your name in might. -- jeremiah 10:6
.
Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? Indeed it is Your due! For among all the wise men of the nations And in all their kingdoms, There is none like You. -- jeremiah 10:7
.
But they are altogether stupid and foolish In their discipline of delusion--their idol is wood! -- jeremiah 10:8
.
Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, And gold from Uphaz, The work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith; Violet and purple are their clothing; They are all the work of skilled men. -- jeremiah 10:9
.
But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth quakes, And the nations cannot endure His indignation. -- jeremiah 10:10
.
Thus you shall say to them, "The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens." -- jeremiah 10:11
.
It is He who made the earth by His power, Who established the world by His wisdom; And by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens. -- jeremiah 10:12
.
When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, And brings out the wind from His storehouses. -- jeremiah 10:13
.
Every man is stupid, devoid of knowledge; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols; For his molten images are deceitful, And there is no breath in them. -- jeremiah 10:14
.
They are worthless, a work of mockery; In the time of their punishment they will perish. -- jeremiah 10:15
.
The portion of Jacob is not like these; For the Maker of all is He, And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; The LORD of hosts is His name. -- jeremiah 10:16
.
Pick up your bundle from the ground, You who dwell under siege! -- jeremiah 10:17
.
For thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land At this time, And will cause them distress, That they may be found." -- jeremiah 10:18
.
Woe is me, because of my injury! My wound is incurable. But I said, "Truly this is a sickness, And I must bear it." -- jeremiah 10:19
.
My tent is destroyed, And all my ropes are broken; My sons have gone from me and are no more. There is no one to stretch out my tent again Or to set up my curtains. -- jeremiah 10:20
.
For the shepherds have become stupid And have not sought the LORD; Therefore they have not prospered, And all their flock is scattered. -- jeremiah 10:21
.
The sound of a report! Behold, it comes-- A great commotion out of the land of the north-- To make the cities of Judah A desolation, a haunt of jackals. -- jeremiah 10:22
.
I know, O LORD, that a man's way is not in himself, Nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps. -- jeremiah 10:23
.
Correct me, O LORD, but with justice; Not with Your anger, or You will bring me to nothing. -- jeremiah 10:24
.
Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You And on the families that do not call Your name; For they have devoured Jacob; They have devoured him and consumed him And have laid waste his habitation. -- jeremiah 10:25
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, -- jeremiah 11:1
.
"Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; -- jeremiah 11:2
.
and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant -- jeremiah 11:3
.
which I commanded your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, 'Listen to My voice, and do according to all which I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God,' -- jeremiah 11:4
.
in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day."'" Then I said, "Amen, O LORD." -- jeremiah 11:5
.
And the LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant and do them. -- jeremiah 11:6
.
'For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning persistently, saying, "Listen to My voice." -- jeremiah 11:7
.
'Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked, each one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.'" -- jeremiah 11:8
.
Then the LORD said to me, "A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 11:9
.
"They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers." -- jeremiah 11:10
.
Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry to Me, yet I will not listen to them. -- jeremiah 11:11
.
"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster. -- jeremiah 11:12
.
"For your gods are as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal. -- jeremiah 11:13
.
"Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster. -- jeremiah 11:14
.
"What right has My beloved in My house When she has done many vile deeds? Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster, So that you can rejoice?" -- jeremiah 11:15
.
The LORD called your name, "A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form"; With the noise of a great tumult He has kindled fire on it, And its branches are worthless. -- jeremiah 11:16
.
The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me by offering up sacrifices to Baal. -- jeremiah 11:17
.
Moreover, the LORD made it known to me and I knew it; Then You showed me their deeds. -- jeremiah 11:18
.
But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; And I did not know that they had devised plots against me, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, And let us cut him off from the land of the living, That his name be remembered no more." -- jeremiah 11:19
.
But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, Who tries the feelings and the heart, Let me see Your vengeance on them, For to You have I committed my cause. -- jeremiah 11:20
.
Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, so that you will not die at our hand"; -- jeremiah 11:21
.
therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will die by famine; -- jeremiah 11:22
.
and a remnant will not be left to them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth--the year of their punishment." -- jeremiah 11:23
.
Righteous are You, O LORD, that I would plead my case with You; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You: Why has the way of the wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease? -- jeremiah 12:1
.
You have planted them, they have also taken root; They grow, they have even produced fruit. You are near to their lips But far from their mind. -- jeremiah 12:2
.
But You know me, O LORD; You see me; And You examine my heart's attitude toward You. Drag them off like sheep for the slaughter And set them apart for a day of carnage! -- jeremiah 12:3
.
How long is the land to mourn And the vegetation of the countryside to wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it, Animals and birds have been snatched away, Because men have said, "He will not see our latter ending." -- jeremiah 12:4
.
"If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out, Then how can you compete with horses? If you fall down in a land of peace, How will you do in the thicket of the Jordan? -- jeremiah 12:5
.
"For even your brothers and the household of your father, Even they have dealt treacherously with you, Even they have cried aloud after you. Do not believe them, although they may say nice things to you." -- jeremiah 12:6
.
"I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My inheritance; I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies. -- jeremiah 12:7
.
"My inheritance has become to Me Like a lion in the forest; She has roared against Me; Therefore I have come to hate her. -- jeremiah 12:8
.
"Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me? Are the birds of prey against her on every side? Go, gather all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour! -- jeremiah 12:9
.
"Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard, They have trampled down My field; They have made My pleasant field A desolate wilderness. -- jeremiah 12:10
.
"It has been made a desolation, Desolate, it mourns before Me; The whole land has been made desolate, Because no man lays it to heart. -- jeremiah 12:11
.
"On all the bare heights in the wilderness Destroyers have come, For a sword of the LORD is devouring From one end of the land even to the other; There is no peace for anyone. -- jeremiah 12:12
.
"They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns, They have strained themselves to no profit. But be ashamed of your harvest Because of the fierce anger of the LORD." -- jeremiah 12:13
.
Thus says the LORD concerning all My wicked neighbors who strike at the inheritance with which I have endowed My people Israel, "Behold I am about to uproot them from their land and will uproot the house of Judah from among them. -- jeremiah 12:14
.
"And it will come about that after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land. -- jeremiah 12:15
.
"Then if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, 'As the LORD lives,' even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, they will be built up in the midst of My people. -- jeremiah 12:16
.
"But if they will not listen, then I will uproot that nation, uproot and destroy it," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 12:17
.
Thus the LORD said to me, "Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water." -- jeremiah 13:1
.
So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the LORD and put it around my waist. -- jeremiah 13:2
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, -- jeremiah 13:3
.
"Take the waistband that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock." -- jeremiah 13:4
.
So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD had commanded me. -- jeremiah 13:5
.
After many days the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there." -- jeremiah 13:6
.
Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it; and lo, the waistband was ruined, it was totally worthless. -- jeremiah 13:7
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- jeremiah 13:8
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'Just so will I destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 13:9
.
'This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let them be just like this waistband which is totally worthless. -- jeremiah 13:10
.
'For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole household of Israel and the whole household of Judah cling to Me,' declares the LORD, 'that they might be for Me a people, for renown, for praise and for glory; but they did not listen.' -- jeremiah 13:11
.
"Therefore you are to speak this word to them, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jug is to be filled with wine."' And when they say to you, 'Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?' -- jeremiah 13:12
.
then say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land--the kings that sit for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem--with drunkenness! -- jeremiah 13:13
.
"I will dash them against each other, both the fathers and the sons together," declares the LORD. "I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have compassion so as not to destroy them."'" -- jeremiah 13:14
.
Listen and give heed, do not be haughty, For the LORD has spoken. -- jeremiah 13:15
.
Give glory to the LORD your God, Before He brings darkness And before your feet stumble On the dusky mountains, And while you are hoping for light He makes it into deep darkness, And turns it into gloom. -- jeremiah 13:16
.
But if you will not listen to it, My soul will sob in secret for such pride; And my eyes will bitterly weep And flow down with tears, Because the flock of the LORD has been taken captive. -- jeremiah 13:17
.
Say to the king and the queen mother, "Take a lowly seat, For your beautiful crown Has come down from your head." -- jeremiah 13:18
.
The cities of the Negev have been locked up, And there is no one to open them; All Judah has been carried into exile, Wholly carried into exile. -- jeremiah 13:19
.
"Lift up your eyes and see Those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, Your beautiful sheep? -- jeremiah 13:20
.
"What will you say when He appoints over you-- And you yourself had taught them-- Former companions to be head over you? Will not pangs take hold of you Like a woman in childbirth? -- jeremiah 13:21
.
"If you say in your heart, 'Why have these things happened to me?' Because of the magnitude of your iniquity Your skirts have been removed And your heels have been exposed. -- jeremiah 13:22
.
"Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his spots? Then you also can do good Who are accustomed to doing evil. -- jeremiah 13:23
.
"Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw To the desert wind. -- jeremiah 13:24
.
"This is your lot, the portion measured to you From Me," declares the LORD, "Because you have forgotten Me And trusted in falsehood. -- jeremiah 13:25
.
"So I Myself have also stripped your skirts off over your face, That your shame may be seen. -- jeremiah 13:26
.
"As for your adulteries and your lustful neighings, The lewdness of your prostitution On the hills in the field, I have seen your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean?" -- jeremiah 13:27
.
That which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah in regard to the drought: -- jeremiah 14:1
.
"Judah mourns And her gates languish; They sit on the ground in mourning, And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended. -- jeremiah 14:2
.
"Their nobles have sent their servants for water; They have come to the cisterns and found no water. They have returned with their vessels empty; They have been put to shame and humiliated, And they cover their heads. -- jeremiah 14:3
.
"Because the ground is cracked, For there has been no rain on the land; The farmers have been put to shame, They have covered their heads. -- jeremiah 14:4
.
"For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon her young, Because there is no grass. -- jeremiah 14:5
.
"The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; They pant for air like jackals, Their eyes fail For there is no vegetation. -- jeremiah 14:6
.
"Although our iniquities testify against us, O LORD, act for Your name's sake! Truly our apostasies have been many, We have sinned against You. -- jeremiah 14:7
.
"O Hope of Israel, Its Savior in time of distress, Why are You like a stranger in the land Or like a traveler who has pitched his tent for the night? -- jeremiah 14:8
.
"Why are You like a man dismayed, Like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet You are in our midst, O LORD, And we are called by Your name; Do not forsake us!" -- jeremiah 14:9
.
Thus says the LORD to this people, "Even so they have loved to wander; they have not kept their feet in check. Therefore the LORD does not accept them; now He will remember their iniquity and call their sins to account." -- jeremiah 14:10
.
So the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for the welfare of this people. -- jeremiah 14:11
.
"When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather I am going to make an end of them by the sword, famine and pestilence." -- jeremiah 14:12
.
But, "Ah, Lord GOD!" I said, "Look, the prophets are telling them, 'You will not see the sword nor will you have famine, but I will give you lasting peace in this place.'" -- jeremiah 14:13
.
Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility and the deception of their own minds. -- jeremiah 14:14
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them--yet they keep saying, 'There will be no sword or famine in this land'--by sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end! -- jeremiah 14:15
.
"The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them--neither them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters--for I will pour out their own wickedness on them. -- jeremiah 14:16
.
"You will say this word to them, 'Let my eyes flow down with tears night and day, And let them not cease; For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow, With a sorely infected wound. -- jeremiah 14:17
.
'If I go out to the country, Behold, those slain with the sword! Or if I enter the city, Behold, diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest Have gone roving about in the land that they do not know.'" -- jeremiah 14:18
.
Have You completely rejected Judah? Or have You loathed Zion? Why have You stricken us so that we are beyond healing? We waited for peace, but nothing good came; And for a time of healing, but behold, terror! -- jeremiah 14:19
.
We know our wickedness, O LORD, The iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against You. -- jeremiah 14:20
.
Do not despise us, for Your own name's sake; Do not disgrace the throne of Your glory; Remember and do not annul Your covenant with us. -- jeremiah 14:21
.
Are there any among the idols of the nations who give rain? Or can the heavens grant showers? Is it not You, O LORD our God? Therefore we hope in You, For You are the one who has done all these things. -- jeremiah 14:22
.
Then the LORD said to me, "Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me, My heart would not be with this people; send them away from My presence and let them go! -- jeremiah 15:1
.
"And it shall be that when they say to you, 'Where should we go?' then you are to tell them, 'Thus says the LORD: "Those destined for death, to death; And those destined for the sword, to the sword; And those destined for famine, to famine; And those destined for captivity, to captivity."' -- jeremiah 15:2
.
"I will appoint over them four kinds of doom," declares the LORD: "the sword to slay, the dogs to drag off, and the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy. -- jeremiah 15:3
.
"I will make them an object of horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 15:4
.
"Indeed, who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, Or who will mourn for you, Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare? -- jeremiah 15:5
.
"You who have forsaken Me," declares the LORD, "You keep going backward. So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am tired of relenting! -- jeremiah 15:6
.
"I will winnow them with a winnowing fork At the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy My people; They did not repent of their ways. -- jeremiah 15:7
.
"Their widows will be more numerous before Me Than the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, against the mother of a young man, A destroyer at noonday; I will suddenly bring down on her Anguish and dismay. -- jeremiah 15:8
.
"She who bore seven sons pines away; Her breathing is labored. Her sun has set while it was yet day; She has been shamed and humiliated. So I will give over their survivors to the sword Before their enemies," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 15:9
.
Woe to me, my mother, that you have borne me As a man of strife and a man of contention to all the land! I have not lent, nor have men lent money to me, Yet everyone curses me. -- jeremiah 15:10
.
The LORD said, "Surely I will set you free for purposes of good; Surely I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you In a time of disaster and a time of distress. -- jeremiah 15:11
.
"Can anyone smash iron, Iron from the north, or bronze? -- jeremiah 15:12
.
"Your wealth and your treasures I will give for booty without cost, Even for all your sins And within all your borders. -- jeremiah 15:13
.
"Then I will cause your enemies to bring it Into a land you do not know; For a fire has been kindled in My anger, It will burn upon you." -- jeremiah 15:14
.
You who know, O LORD, Remember me, take notice of me, And take vengeance for me on my persecutors. Do not, in view of Your patience, take me away; Know that for Your sake I endure reproach. -- jeremiah 15:15
.
Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name, O LORD God of hosts. -- jeremiah 15:16
.
I did not sit in the circle of merrymakers, Nor did I exult. Because of Your hand upon me I sat alone, For You filled me with indignation. -- jeremiah 15:17
.
Why has my pain been perpetual And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will You indeed be to me like a deceptive stream With water that is unreliable? -- jeremiah 15:18
.
Therefore, thus says the LORD, "If you return, then I will restore you-- Before Me you will stand; And if you extract the precious from the worthless, You will become My spokesman. They for their part may turn to you, But as for you, you must not turn to them. -- jeremiah 15:19
.
"Then I will make you to this people A fortified wall of bronze; And though they fight against you, They will not prevail over you; For I am with you to save you And deliver you," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 15:20
.
"So I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem you from the grasp of the violent." -- jeremiah 15:21
.
The word of the LORD also came to me saying, -- jeremiah 16:1
.
"You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this place." -- jeremiah 16:2
.
For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bear them, and their fathers who beget them in this land: -- jeremiah 16:3
.
"They will die of deadly diseases, they will not be lamented or buried; they will be as dung on the surface of the ground and come to an end by sword and famine, and their carcasses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth." -- jeremiah 16:4
.
For thus says the LORD, "Do not enter a house of mourning, or go to lament or to console them; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people," declares the LORD, "My lovingkindness and compassion. -- jeremiah 16:5
.
"Both great men and small will die in this land; they will not be buried, they will not be lamented, nor will anyone gash himself or shave his head for them. -- jeremiah 16:6
.
"Men will not break bread in mourning for them, to comfort anyone for the dead, nor give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone's father or mother. -- jeremiah 16:7
.
"Moreover you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink." -- jeremiah 16:8
.
For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I am going to eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your time, the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride. -- jeremiah 16:9
.
"Now when you tell this people all these words, they will say to you, 'For what reason has the LORD declared all this great calamity against us? And what is our iniquity, or what is our sin which we have committed against the LORD our God?' -- jeremiah 16:10
.
"Then you are to say to them, 'It is because your forefathers have forsaken Me,' declares the LORD, 'and have followed other gods and served them and bowed down to them; but Me they have forsaken and have not kept My law. -- jeremiah 16:11
.
'You too have done evil, even more than your forefathers; for behold, you are each one walking according to the stubbornness of his own evil heart, without listening to Me. -- jeremiah 16:12
.
'So I will hurl you out of this land into the land which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will grant you no favor.' -- jeremiah 16:13
.
"Therefore behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be said, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,' -- jeremiah 16:14
.
but, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries where He had banished them.' For I will restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers. -- jeremiah 16:15
.
"Behold, I am going to send for many fishermen," declares the LORD, "and they will fish for them; and afterwards I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and every hill and from the clefts of the rocks. -- jeremiah 16:16
.
"For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes. -- jeremiah 16:17
.
"I will first doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable idols and with their abominations." -- jeremiah 16:18
.
O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, And my refuge in the day of distress, To You the nations will come From the ends of the earth and say, "Our fathers have inherited nothing but falsehood, Futility and things of no profit." -- jeremiah 16:19
.
Can man make gods for himself? Yet they are not gods! -- jeremiah 16:20
.
"Therefore behold, I am going to make them know-- This time I will make them know My power and My might; And they shall know that My name is the LORD." -- jeremiah 16:21
.
The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus; With a diamond point it is engraved upon the tablet of their heart And on the horns of their altars, -- jeremiah 17:1
.
As they remember their children, So they remember their altars and their Asherim By green trees on the high hills. -- jeremiah 17:2
.
O mountain of Mine in the countryside, I will give over your wealth and all your treasures for booty, Your high places for sin throughout your borders. -- jeremiah 17:3
.
And you will, even of yourself, let go of your inheritance That I gave you; And I will make you serve your enemies In the land which you do not know; For you have kindled a fire in My anger Which will burn forever. -- jeremiah 17:4
.
Thus says the LORD, "Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the LORD. -- jeremiah 17:5
.
"For he will be like a bush in the desert And will not see when prosperity comes, But will live in stony wastes in the wilderness, A land of salt without inhabitant. -- jeremiah 17:6
.
"Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD And whose trust is the LORD. -- jeremiah 17:7
.
"For he will be like a tree planted by the water, That extends its roots by a stream And will not fear when the heat comes; But its leaves will be green, And it will not be anxious in a year of drought Nor cease to yield fruit. -- jeremiah 17:8
.
"The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick; Who can understand it? -- jeremiah 17:9
.
"I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his deeds. -- jeremiah 17:10
.
"As a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not laid, So is he who makes a fortune, but unjustly; In the midst of his days it will forsake him, And in the end he will be a fool." -- jeremiah 17:11
.
A glorious throne on high from the beginning Is the place of our sanctuary. -- jeremiah 17:12
.
O LORD, the hope of Israel, All who forsake You will be put to shame. Those who turn away on earth will be written down, Because they have forsaken the fountain of living water, even the LORD. -- jeremiah 17:13
.
Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed; Save me and I will be saved, For You are my praise. -- jeremiah 17:14
.
Look, they keep saying to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come now!" -- jeremiah 17:15
.
But as for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd after You, Nor have I longed for the woeful day; You Yourself know that the utterance of my lips Was in Your presence. -- jeremiah 17:16
.
Do not be a terror to me; You are my refuge in the day of disaster. -- jeremiah 17:17
.
Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but as for me, let me not be put to shame; Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring on them a day of disaster, And crush them with twofold destruction! -- jeremiah 17:18
.
Thus the LORD said to me, "Go and stand in the public gate, through which the kings of Judah come in and go out, as well as in all the gates of Jerusalem; -- jeremiah 17:19
.
and say to them, 'Listen to the word of the LORD, kings of Judah, and all Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem who come in through these gates: -- jeremiah 17:20
.
'Thus says the LORD, "Take heed for yourselves, and do not carry any load on the sabbath day or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 17:21
.
"You shall not bring a load out of your houses on the sabbath day nor do any work, but keep the sabbath day holy, as I commanded your forefathers. -- jeremiah 17:22
.
"Yet they did not listen or incline their ears, but stiffened their necks in order not to listen or take correction. -- jeremiah 17:23
.
"But it will come about, if you listen attentively to Me," declares the LORD, "to bring no load in through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to keep the sabbath day holy by doing no work on it, -- jeremiah 17:24
.
then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. -- jeremiah 17:25
.
"They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the environs of Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the LORD. -- jeremiah 17:26
.
"But if you do not listen to Me to keep the sabbath day holy by not carrying a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not be quenched."'" -- jeremiah 17:27
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying, -- jeremiah 18:1
.
"Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will announce My words to you." -- jeremiah 18:2
.
Then I went down to the potter's house, and there he was, making something on the wheel. -- jeremiah 18:3
.
But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make. -- jeremiah 18:4
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me saying, -- jeremiah 18:5
.
"Can I not, O house of Israel, deal with you as this potter does?" declares the LORD. "Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel. -- jeremiah 18:6
.
"At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or to destroy it; -- jeremiah 18:7
.
if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it. -- jeremiah 18:8
.
"Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant it; -- jeremiah 18:9
.
if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will think better of the good with which I had promised to bless it. -- jeremiah 18:10
.
"So now then, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds."' -- jeremiah 18:11
.
"But they will say, 'It's hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.' -- jeremiah 18:12
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD, 'Ask now among the nations, Who ever heard the like of this? The virgin of Israel Has done a most appalling thing. -- jeremiah 18:13
.
'Does the snow of Lebanon forsake the rock of the open country? Or is the cold flowing water from a foreign land ever snatched away? -- jeremiah 18:14
.
'For My people have forgotten Me, They burn incense to worthless gods And they have stumbled from their ways, From the ancient paths, To walk in bypaths, Not on a highway, -- jeremiah 18:15
.
To make their land a desolation, An object of perpetual hissing; Everyone who passes by it will be astonished And shake his head. -- jeremiah 18:16
.
'Like an east wind I will scatter them Before the enemy; I will show them My back and not My face In the day of their calamity.'" -- jeremiah 18:17
.
Then they said, "Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah. Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the sage, nor the divine word to the prophet! Come on and let us strike at him with our tongue, and let us give no heed to any of his words." -- jeremiah 18:18
.
Do give heed to me, O LORD, And listen to what my opponents are saying! -- jeremiah 18:19
.
Should good be repaid with evil? For they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before You To speak good on their behalf, So as to turn away Your wrath from them. -- jeremiah 18:20
.
Therefore, give their children over to famine And deliver them up to the power of the sword; And let their wives become childless and widowed. Let their men also be smitten to death, Their young men struck down by the sword in battle. -- jeremiah 18:21
.
May an outcry be heard from their houses, When You suddenly bring raiders upon them; For they have dug a pit to capture me And hidden snares for my feet. -- jeremiah 18:22
.
Yet You, O LORD, know All their deadly designs against me; Do not forgive their iniquity Or blot out their sin from Your sight. But may they be overthrown before You; Deal with them in the time of Your anger! -- jeremiah 18:23
.
Thus says the LORD, "Go and buy a potter's earthenware jar, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests. -- jeremiah 19:1
.
"Then go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is by the entrance of the potsherd gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you, -- jeremiah 19:2
.
and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Behold I am about to bring a calamity upon this place, at which the ears of everyone that hears of it will tingle. -- jeremiah 19:3
.
"Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods, that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent -- jeremiah 19:4
.
and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter My mind; -- jeremiah 19:5
.
therefore, behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the valley of Slaughter. -- jeremiah 19:6
.
"I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. -- jeremiah 19:7
.
"I will also make this city a desolation and an object of hissing; everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its disasters. -- jeremiah 19:8
.
"I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life will distress them."' -- jeremiah 19:9
.
"Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you -- jeremiah 19:10
.
and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Just so will I break this people and this city, even as one breaks a potter's vessel, which cannot again be repaired; and they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place for burial. -- jeremiah 19:11
.
"This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants," declares the LORD, "so as to make this city like Topheth. -- jeremiah 19:12
.
"The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place Topheth, because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned sacrifices to all the heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods."'" -- jeremiah 19:13
.
Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house and said to all the people: -- jeremiah 19:14
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire calamity that I have declared against it, because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.'" -- jeremiah 19:15
.
When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things, -- jeremiah 20:1
.
Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the LORD. -- jeremiah 20:2
.
On the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "Pashhur is not the name the LORD has called you, but rather Magor-missabib. -- jeremiah 20:3
.
"For thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will fall by the sword of their enemies. So I will give over all Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword. -- jeremiah 20:4
.
'I will also give over all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away and bring them to Babylon. -- jeremiah 20:5
.
'And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.'" -- jeremiah 20:6
.
O LORD, You have deceived me and I was deceived; You have overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me. -- jeremiah 20:7
.
For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and destruction, Because for me the word of the LORD has resulted In reproach and derision all day long. -- jeremiah 20:8
.
But if I say, "I will not remember Him Or speak anymore in His name," Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am weary of holding it in, And I cannot endure it. -- jeremiah 20:9
.
For I have heard the whispering of many, "Terror on every side! Denounce him; yes, let us denounce him!" All my trusted friends, Watching for my fall, say: "Perhaps he will be deceived, so that we may prevail against him And take our revenge on him." -- jeremiah 20:10
.
But the LORD is with me like a dread champion; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be utterly ashamed, because they have failed, With an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten. -- jeremiah 20:11
.
Yet, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set forth my cause. -- jeremiah 20:12
.
Sing to the LORD, praise the LORD! For He has delivered the soul of the needy one From the hand of evildoers. -- jeremiah 20:13
.
Cursed be the day when I was born; Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me! -- jeremiah 20:14
.
Cursed be the man who brought the news To my father, saying, "A baby boy has been born to you!" And made him very happy. -- jeremiah 20:15
.
But let that man be like the cities Which the LORD overthrew without relenting, And let him hear an outcry in the morning And a shout of alarm at noon; -- jeremiah 20:16
.
Because he did not kill me before birth, So that my mother would have been my grave, And her womb ever pregnant. -- jeremiah 20:17
.
Why did I ever come forth from the womb To look on trouble and sorrow, So that my days have been spent in shame? -- jeremiah 20:18
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying, -- jeremiah 21:1
.
"Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us; perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all His wonderful acts, so that the enemy will withdraw from us." -- jeremiah 21:2
.
Then Jeremiah said to them, "You shall say to Zedekiah as follows: -- jeremiah 21:3
.
'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, "Behold, I am about to turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands, with which you are warring against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will gather them into the center of this city. -- jeremiah 21:4
.
"I Myself will war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, even in anger and wrath and great indignation. -- jeremiah 21:5
.
"I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence. -- jeremiah 21:6
.
"Then afterwards," declares the LORD, "I will give over Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people, even those who survive in this city from the pestilence, the sword and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their foes and into the hand of those who seek their lives; and he will strike them down with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them nor have pity nor compassion."' -- jeremiah 21:7
.
"You shall also say to this people, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. -- jeremiah 21:8
.
"He who dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence; but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as booty. -- jeremiah 21:9
.
"For I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good," declares the LORD. "It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire."' -- jeremiah 21:10
.
"Then say to the household of the king of Judah, 'Hear the word of the LORD, -- jeremiah 21:11
.
O house of David, thus says the LORD: "Administer justice every morning; And deliver the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor, That My wrath may not go forth like fire And burn with none to extinguish it, Because of the evil of their deeds. -- jeremiah 21:12
.
"Behold, I am against you, O valley dweller, O rocky plain," declares the LORD, "You men who say, 'Who will come down against us? Or who will enter into our habitations?' -- jeremiah 21:13
.
"But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds," declares the LORD, "And I will kindle a fire in its forest That it may devour all its environs."'" -- jeremiah 21:14
.
Thus says the LORD, "Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there speak this word -- jeremiah 22:1
.
and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on David's throne, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates. -- jeremiah 22:2
.
'Thus says the LORD, "Do justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor. Also do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow; and do not shed innocent blood in this place. -- jeremiah 22:3
.
"For if you men will indeed perform this thing, then kings will enter the gates of this house, sitting in David's place on his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, even the king himself and his servants and his people. -- jeremiah 22:4
.
"But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself," declares the LORD, "that this house will become a desolation."'" -- jeremiah 22:5
.
For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah: "You are like Gilead to Me, Like the summit of Lebanon; Yet most assuredly I will make you like a wilderness, Like cities which are not inhabited. -- jeremiah 22:6
.
"For I will set apart destroyers against you, Each with his weapons; And they will cut down your choicest cedars And throw them on the fire. -- jeremiah 22:7
.
"Many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this great city?' -- jeremiah 22:8
.
"Then they will answer, 'Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.'" -- jeremiah 22:9
.
Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him, But weep continually for the one who goes away; For he will never return Or see his native land. -- jeremiah 22:10
.
For thus says the LORD in regard to Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place, "He will never return there; -- jeremiah 22:11
.
but in the place where they led him captive, there he will die and not see this land again. -- jeremiah 22:12
.
"Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness And his upper rooms without justice, Who uses his neighbor's services without pay And does not give him his wages, -- jeremiah 22:13
.
Who says, 'I will build myself a roomy house With spacious upper rooms, And cut out its windows, Paneling it with cedar and painting it bright red.' -- jeremiah 22:14
.
"Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink And do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him. -- jeremiah 22:15
.
"He pled the cause of the afflicted and needy; Then it was well. Is not that what it means to know Me?" Declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 22:16
.
"But your eyes and your heart Are intent only upon your own dishonest gain, And on shedding innocent blood And on practicing oppression and extortion." -- jeremiah 22:17
.
Therefore thus says the LORD in regard to Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, "They will not lament for him: 'Alas, my brother!' or, 'Alas, sister!' They will not lament for him: 'Alas for the master!' or, 'Alas for his splendor!' -- jeremiah 22:18
.
"He will be buried with a donkey's burial, Dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 22:19
.
"Go up to Lebanon and cry out, And lift up your voice in Bashan; Cry out also from Abarim, For all your lovers have been crushed. -- jeremiah 22:20
.
"I spoke to you in your prosperity; But you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your practice from your youth, That you have not obeyed My voice. -- jeremiah 22:21
.
"The wind will sweep away all your shepherds, And your lovers will go into captivity; Then you will surely be ashamed and humiliated Because of all your wickedness. -- jeremiah 22:22
.
"You who dwell in Lebanon, Nested in the cedars, How you will groan when pangs come upon you, Pain like a woman in childbirth! -- jeremiah 22:23
.
"As I live," declares the LORD, "even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off; -- jeremiah 22:24
.
and I will give you over into the hand of those who are seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. -- jeremiah 22:25
.
"I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die. -- jeremiah 22:26
.
"But as for the land to which they desire to return, they will not return to it. -- jeremiah 22:27
.
"Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar? Or is he an undesirable vessel? Why have he and his descendants been hurled out And cast into a land that they had not known? -- jeremiah 22:28
.
"O land, land, land, Hear the word of the LORD! -- jeremiah 22:29
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'Write this man down childless, A man who will not prosper in his days; For no man of his descendants will prosper Sitting on the throne of David Or ruling again in Judah.'" -- jeremiah 22:30
.
"Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!" declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:1
.
Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the shepherds who are tending My people: "You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not attended to them; behold, I am about to attend to you for the evil of your deeds," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:2
.
"Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their pasture, and they will be fruitful and multiply. -- jeremiah 23:3
.
"I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them; and they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:4
.
"Behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; And He will reign as king and act wisely And do justice and righteousness in the land. -- jeremiah 23:5
.
"In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, 'The LORD our righteousness.' -- jeremiah 23:6
.
"Therefore behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when they will no longer say, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt,' -- jeremiah 23:7
.
but, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up and led back the descendants of the household of Israel from the north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.' Then they will live on their own soil." -- jeremiah 23:8
.
As for the prophets: My heart is broken within me, All my bones tremble; I have become like a drunken man, Even like a man overcome with wine, Because of the LORD And because of His holy words. -- jeremiah 23:9
.
For the land is full of adulterers; For the land mourns because of the curse. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course also is evil And their might is not right. -- jeremiah 23:10
.
"For both prophet and priest are polluted; Even in My house I have found their wickedness," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:11
.
"Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them, They will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it; For I will bring calamity upon them, The year of their punishment," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:12
.
"Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray. -- jeremiah 23:13
.
"Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: The committing of adultery and walking in falsehood; And they strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one has turned back from his wickedness. All of them have become to Me like Sodom, And her inhabitants like Gomorrah. -- jeremiah 23:14
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets, 'Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood And make them drink poisonous water, For from the prophets of Jerusalem Pollution has gone forth into all the land.'" -- jeremiah 23:15
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into futility; They speak a vision of their own imagination, Not from the mouth of the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:16
.
"They keep saying to those who despise Me, 'The LORD has said, "You will have peace"'; And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, They say, 'Calamity will not come upon you.' -- jeremiah 23:17
.
"But who has stood in the council of the LORD, That he should see and hear His word? Who has given heed to His word and listened? -- jeremiah 23:18
.
"Behold, the storm of the LORD has gone forth in wrath, Even a whirling tempest; It will swirl down on the head of the wicked. -- jeremiah 23:19
.
"The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it. -- jeremiah 23:20
.
"I did not send these prophets, But they ran. I did not speak to them, But they prophesied. -- jeremiah 23:21
.
"But if they had stood in My council, Then they would have announced My words to My people, And would have turned them back from their evil way And from the evil of their deeds. -- jeremiah 23:22
.
"Am I a God who is near," declares the LORD, "And not a God far off? -- jeremiah 23:23
.
"Can a man hide himself in hiding places So I do not see him?" declares the LORD. "Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?" declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:24
.
"I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, 'I had a dream, I had a dream!' -- jeremiah 23:25
.
"How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, even these prophets of the deception of their own heart, -- jeremiah 23:26
.
who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they relate to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal? -- jeremiah 23:27
.
"The prophet who has a dream may relate his dream, but let him who has My word speak My word in truth. What does straw have in common with grain?" declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:28
.
"Is not My word like fire?" declares the LORD, "and like a hammer which shatters a rock? -- jeremiah 23:29
.
"Therefore behold, I am against the prophets," declares the LORD, "who steal My words from each other. -- jeremiah 23:30
.
"Behold, I am against the prophets," declares the LORD, "who use their tongues and declare, 'The Lord declares.' -- jeremiah 23:31
.
"Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams," declares the LORD, "and related them and led My people astray by their falsehoods and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them or command them, nor do they furnish this people the slightest benefit," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 23:32
.
"Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you saying, 'What is the oracle of the LORD?' then you shall say to them, 'What oracle?' The LORD declares, 'I will abandon you.' -- jeremiah 23:33
.
"Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, 'The oracle of the LORD,' I will bring punishment upon that man and his household. -- jeremiah 23:34
.
"Thus will each of you say to his neighbor and to his brother, 'What has the LORD answered?' or, 'What has the LORD spoken?' -- jeremiah 23:35
.
"For you will no longer remember the oracle of the LORD, because every man's own word will become the oracle, and you have perverted the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God. -- jeremiah 23:36
.
"Thus you will say to that prophet, 'What has the LORD answered you?' and, 'What has the LORD spoken?' -- jeremiah 23:37
.
"For if you say, 'The oracle of the LORD!' surely thus says the LORD, 'Because you said this word, "The oracle of the LORD!" I have also sent to you, saying, "You shall not say, 'The oracle of the LORD!'"' -- jeremiah 23:38
.
"Therefore behold, I will surely forget you and cast you away from My presence, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers. -- jeremiah 23:39
.
"I will put an everlasting reproach on you and an everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten." -- jeremiah 23:40
.
After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me: behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of the LORD! -- jeremiah 24:1
.
One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness. -- jeremiah 24:2
.
Then the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness." -- jeremiah 24:3
.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- jeremiah 24:4
.
"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans. -- jeremiah 24:5
.
'For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not pluck them up. -- jeremiah 24:6
.
'I will give them a heart to know Me, for I am the LORD; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart. -- jeremiah 24:7
.
'But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness--indeed, thus says the LORD--so I will abandon Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and the ones who dwell in the land of Egypt. -- jeremiah 24:8
.
'I will make them a terror and an evil for all the kingdoms of the earth, as a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all places where I will scatter them. -- jeremiah 24:9
.
'I will send the sword, the famine and the pestilence upon them until they are destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers.'" -- jeremiah 24:10
.
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), -- jeremiah 25:1
.
which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, -- jeremiah 25:2
.
"From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened. -- jeremiah 25:3
.
"And the LORD has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear, -- jeremiah 25:4
.
saying, 'Turn now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell on the land which the LORD has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever; -- jeremiah 25:5
.
and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm.' -- jeremiah 25:6
.
"Yet you have not listened to Me," declares the LORD, "in order that you might provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm. -- jeremiah 25:7
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Because you have not obeyed My words, -- jeremiah 25:8
.
behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,' declares the LORD, 'and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them and make them a horror and a hissing, and an everlasting desolation. -- jeremiah 25:9
.
'Moreover, I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp. -- jeremiah 25:10
.
'This whole land will be a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. -- jeremiah 25:11
.
'Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' declares the LORD, 'for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation. -- jeremiah 25:12
.
'I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. -- jeremiah 25:13
.
'(For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.)'" -- jeremiah 25:14
.
For thus the LORD, the God of Israel, says to me, "Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it. -- jeremiah 25:15
.
"They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them." -- jeremiah 25:16
.
Then I took the cup from the LORD'S hand and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it: -- jeremiah 25:17
.
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and its kings and its princes, to make them a ruin, a horror, a hissing and a curse, as it is this day; -- jeremiah 25:18
.
Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes and all his people; -- jeremiah 25:19
.
and all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (even Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod); -- jeremiah 25:20
.
Edom, Moab and the sons of Ammon; -- jeremiah 25:21
.
and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea; -- jeremiah 25:22
.
and Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who cut the corners of their hair; -- jeremiah 25:23
.
and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who dwell in the desert; -- jeremiah 25:24
.
and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media; -- jeremiah 25:25
.
and all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face of the ground, and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them. -- jeremiah 25:26
.
"You shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among you."' -- jeremiah 25:27
.
"And it will be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "You shall surely drink! -- jeremiah 25:28
.
"For behold, I am beginning to work calamity in this city which is called by My name, and shall you be completely free from punishment? You will not be free from punishment; for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth," declares the LORD of hosts.' -- jeremiah 25:29
.
"Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them, 'The LORD will roar from on high And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, Against all the inhabitants of the earth. -- jeremiah 25:30
.
'A clamor has come to the end of the earth, Because the LORD has a controversy with the nations. He is entering into judgment with all flesh; As for the wicked, He has given them to the sword,' declares the LORD." -- jeremiah 25:31
.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, evil is going forth From nation to nation, And a great storm is being stirred up From the remotest parts of the earth. -- jeremiah 25:32
.
"Those slain by the LORD on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be lamented, gathered or buried; they will be like dung on the face of the ground. -- jeremiah 25:33
.
"Wail, you shepherds, and cry; And wallow in ashes, you masters of the flock; For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come, And you will fall like a choice vessel. -- jeremiah 25:34
.
"Flight will perish from the shepherds, And escape from the masters of the flock. -- jeremiah 25:35
.
"Hear the sound of the cry of the shepherds, And the wailing of the masters of the flock! For the LORD is destroying their pasture, -- jeremiah 25:36
.
"And the peaceful folds are made silent Because of the fierce anger of the LORD. -- jeremiah 25:37
.
"He has left His hiding place like the lion; For their land has become a horror Because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword And because of His fierce anger." -- jeremiah 25:38
.
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying, -- jeremiah 26:1
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak to all the cities of Judah who have come to worship in the LORD'S house all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them. Do not omit a word! -- jeremiah 26:2
.
'Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.' -- jeremiah 26:3
.
"And you will say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you, -- jeremiah 26:4
.
to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened; -- jeremiah 26:5
.
then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth."'" -- jeremiah 26:6
.
The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. -- jeremiah 26:7
.
When Jeremiah finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, "You must die! -- jeremiah 26:8
.
"Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD saying, 'This house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the LORD. -- jeremiah 26:9
.
When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and sat in the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD'S house. -- jeremiah 26:10
.
Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people, saying, "A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city as you have heard in your hearing." -- jeremiah 26:11
.
Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. -- jeremiah 26:12
.
"Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will change His mind about the misfortune which He has pronounced against you. -- jeremiah 26:13
.
"But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your sight. -- jeremiah 26:14
.
"Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing." -- jeremiah 26:15
.
Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, "No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God." -- jeremiah 26:16
.
Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, -- jeremiah 26:17
.
"Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, 'Thus the LORD of hosts has said, "Zion will be plowed as a field, And Jerusalem will become ruins, And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest."' -- jeremiah 26:18
.
"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and the LORD changed His mind about the misfortune which He had pronounced against them? But we are committing a great evil against ourselves." -- jeremiah 26:19
.
Indeed, there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land words similar to all those of Jeremiah. -- jeremiah 26:20
.
When King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard it, and he was afraid and fled and went to Egypt. -- jeremiah 26:21
.
Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him went into Egypt. -- jeremiah 26:22
.
And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with a sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people. -- jeremiah 26:23
.
But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death. -- jeremiah 26:24
.
In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying-- -- jeremiah 27:1
.
thus says the LORD to me--"Make for yourself bonds and yokes and put them on your neck, -- jeremiah 27:2
.
and send word to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the sons of Ammon, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. -- jeremiah 27:3
.
"Command them to go to their masters, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, thus you shall say to your masters, -- jeremiah 27:4
.
"I have made the earth, the men and the beasts which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight. -- jeremiah 27:5
.
"Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have given him also the wild animals of the field to serve him. -- jeremiah 27:6
.
"All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant. -- jeremiah 27:7
.
"It will be, that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine and with pestilence," declares the LORD, "until I have destroyed it by his hand. -- jeremiah 27:8
.
"But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers or your sorcerers who speak to you, saying, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon.' -- jeremiah 27:9
.
"For they prophesy a lie to you in order to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out and you will perish. -- jeremiah 27:10
.
"But the nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land," declares the LORD, "and they will till it and dwell in it."'" -- jeremiah 27:11
.
I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live! -- jeremiah 27:12
.
"Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine and pestilence, as the LORD has spoken to that nation which will not serve the king of Babylon? -- jeremiah 27:13
.
"So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' for they prophesy a lie to you; -- jeremiah 27:14
.
for I have not sent them," declares the LORD, "but they prophesy falsely in My name, in order that I may drive you out and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you." -- jeremiah 27:15
.
Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, 'Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon'; for they are prophesying a lie to you. -- jeremiah 27:16
.
"Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a ruin? -- jeremiah 27:17
.
"But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now entreat the LORD of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon. -- jeremiah 27:18
.
"For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the stands and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, -- jeremiah 27:19
.
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 27:20
.
"Yes, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem, -- jeremiah 27:21
.
'They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them,' declares the LORD. 'Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.'" -- jeremiah 27:22
.
Now in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying, -- jeremiah 28:1
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. -- jeremiah 28:2
.
'Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon. -- jeremiah 28:3
.
'I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,' declares the LORD, 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'" -- jeremiah 28:4
.
Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD, -- jeremiah 28:5
.
and the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD confirm your words which you have prophesied to bring back the vessels of the LORD'S house and all the exiles, from Babylon to this place. -- jeremiah 28:6
.
"Yet hear now this word which I am about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people! -- jeremiah 28:7
.
"The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of calamity and of pestilence. -- jeremiah 28:8
.
"The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known as one whom the LORD has truly sent." -- jeremiah 28:9
.
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. -- jeremiah 28:10
.
Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD, 'Even so will I break within two full years the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.'" Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way. -- jeremiah 28:11
.
The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 28:12
.
"Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made instead of them yokes of iron." -- jeremiah 28:13
.
'For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. And I have also given him the beasts of the field."'" -- jeremiah 28:14
.
Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, "Listen now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. -- jeremiah 28:15
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you have counseled rebellion against the LORD.'" -- jeremiah 28:16
.
So Hananiah the prophet died in the same year in the seventh month. -- jeremiah 28:17
.
Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. -- jeremiah 29:1
.
(This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.) -- jeremiah 29:2
.
The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying, -- jeremiah 29:3
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, -- jeremiah 29:4
.
'Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce. -- jeremiah 29:5
.
'Take wives and become the fathers of sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there and do not decrease. -- jeremiah 29:6
.
'Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf; for in its welfare you will have welfare.' -- jeremiah 29:7
.
"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams which they dream. -- jeremiah 29:8
.
'For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,' declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 29:9
.
"For thus says the LORD, 'When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place. -- jeremiah 29:10
.
'For I know the plans that I have for you,' declares the LORD, 'plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope. -- jeremiah 29:11
.
'Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. -- jeremiah 29:12
.
'You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. -- jeremiah 29:13
.
'I will be found by you,' declares the LORD, 'and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you,' declares the LORD, 'and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.' -- jeremiah 29:14
.
"Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon'-- -- jeremiah 29:15
.
for thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile-- -- jeremiah 29:16
.
thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am sending upon them the sword, famine and pestilence, and I will make them like split-open figs that cannot be eaten due to rottenness. -- jeremiah 29:17
.
'I will pursue them with the sword, with famine and with pestilence; and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse and a horror and a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, -- jeremiah 29:18
.
because they have not listened to My words,' declares the LORD, 'which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; but you did not listen,' declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 29:19
.
"You, therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. -- jeremiah 29:20
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in My name, 'Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will slay them before your eyes. -- jeremiah 29:21
.
'Because of them a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon, saying, "May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire, -- jeremiah 29:22
.
because they have acted foolishly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I did not command them; and I am He who knows and am a witness," declares the LORD.'" -- jeremiah 29:23
.
To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying, -- jeremiah 29:24
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, -- jeremiah 29:25
.
"The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be the overseer in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar, -- jeremiah 29:26
.
now then, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you? -- jeremiah 29:27
.
"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, 'The exile will be long; build houses and live in them and plant gardens and eat their produce.'"'" -- jeremiah 29:28
.
Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet. -- jeremiah 29:29
.
Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 29:30
.
"Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, "Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie," -- jeremiah 29:31
.
therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he will not have anyone living among this people, and he will not see the good that I am about to do to My people," declares the LORD, "because he has preached rebellion against the LORD."'" -- jeremiah 29:32
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, -- jeremiah 30:1
.
"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book. -- jeremiah 30:2
.
'For behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.' The LORD says, 'I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers and they shall possess it.'" -- jeremiah 30:3
.
Now these are the words which the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah: -- jeremiah 30:4
.
"For thus says the LORD, 'I have heard a sound of terror, Of dread, and there is no peace. -- jeremiah 30:5
.
'Ask now, and see If a male can give birth. Why do I see every man With his hands on his loins, as a woman in childbirth? And why have all faces turned pale? -- jeremiah 30:6
.
'Alas! for that day is great, There is none like it; And it is the time of Jacob's distress, But he will be saved from it. -- jeremiah 30:7
.
'It shall come about on that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'that I will break his yoke from off their neck and will tear off their bonds; and strangers will no longer make them their slaves. -- jeremiah 30:8
.
'But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. -- jeremiah 30:9
.
'Fear not, O Jacob My servant,' declares the LORD, 'And do not be dismayed, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from afar And your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease, And no one will make him afraid. -- jeremiah 30:10
.
'For I am with you,' declares the LORD, 'to save you; For I will destroy completely all the nations where I have scattered you, Only I will not destroy you completely. But I will chasten you justly And will by no means leave you unpunished.' -- jeremiah 30:11
.
"For thus says the LORD, 'Your wound is incurable And your injury is serious. -- jeremiah 30:12
.
'There is no one to plead your cause; No healing for your sore, No recovery for you. -- jeremiah 30:13
.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. -- jeremiah 32:1
.
Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah, -- jeremiah 32:2
.
because Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, "Why do you prophesy, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it; -- jeremiah 32:3
.
and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye; -- jeremiah 32:4
.
and he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him," declares the LORD. "If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed"'?" -- jeremiah 32:5
.
And Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me, saying, -- jeremiah 32:6
.
'Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, "Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it."' -- jeremiah 32:7
.
"Then Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD and said to me, 'Buy my field, please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. -- jeremiah 32:8
.
"I bought the field which was at Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver. -- jeremiah 32:9
.
"I signed and sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales. -- jeremiah 32:10
.
"Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions and the open copy; -- jeremiah 32:11
.
and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle's son and in the sight of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. -- jeremiah 32:12
.
"And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying, -- jeremiah 32:13
.
'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Take these deeds, this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, that they may last a long time." -- jeremiah 32:14
.
'For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land."' -- jeremiah 32:15
.
"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, then I prayed to the LORD, saying, -- jeremiah 32:16
.
'Ah Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You, -- jeremiah 32:17
.
who shows lovingkindness to thousands, but repays the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, O great and mighty God. The LORD of hosts is His name; -- jeremiah 32:18
.
great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds; -- jeremiah 32:19
.
who has set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day both in Israel and among mankind; and You have made a name for Yourself, as at this day. -- jeremiah 32:20
.
'You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror; -- jeremiah 32:21
.
and gave them this land, which You swore to their forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. -- jeremiah 32:22
.
'They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have made all this calamity come upon them. -- jeremiah 32:23
.
'Behold, the siege ramps have reached the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine and the pestilence; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold, You see it. -- jeremiah 32:24
.
'You have said to me, O Lord GOD, "Buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses"--although the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'" -- jeremiah 32:25
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 32:26
.
"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?" -- jeremiah 32:27
.
Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it. -- jeremiah 32:28
.
"The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will enter and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses where people have offered incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger. -- jeremiah 32:29
.
"Indeed the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been doing only evil in My sight from their youth; for the sons of Israel have been only provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 32:30
.
"Indeed this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this day, so that it should be removed from before My face, -- jeremiah 32:31
.
because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger--they, their kings, their leaders, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 32:32
.
"They have turned their back to Me and not their face; though I taught them, teaching again and again, they would not listen and receive instruction. -- jeremiah 32:33
.
"But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. -- jeremiah 32:34
.
"They built the high places of Baal that are in the valley of Ben-hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I had not commanded them nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. -- jeremiah 32:35
.
"Now therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine and by pestilence.' -- jeremiah 32:36
.
"Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety. -- jeremiah 32:37
.
"They shall be My people, and I will be their God; -- jeremiah 32:38
.
and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always, for their own good and for the good of their children after them. -- jeremiah 32:39
.
"I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me. -- jeremiah 32:40
.
"I will rejoice over them to do them good and will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul. -- jeremiah 32:41
.
"For thus says the LORD, 'Just as I brought all this great disaster on this people, so I am going to bring on them all the good that I am promising them. -- jeremiah 32:42
.
'Fields will be bought in this land of which you say, "It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans." -- jeremiah 32:43
.
'Men will buy fields for money, sign and seal deeds, and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev; for I will restore their fortunes,' declares the LORD." -- jeremiah 32:44
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the court of the guard, saying, -- jeremiah 33:1
.
"Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it, the LORD is His name, -- jeremiah 33:2
.
'Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.' -- jeremiah 33:3
.
"For thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which are broken down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword, -- jeremiah 33:4
.
'While they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans and to fill them with the corpses of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My wrath, and I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness: -- jeremiah 33:5
.
'Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth. -- jeremiah 33:6
.
'I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel and will rebuild them as they were at first. -- jeremiah 33:7
.
'I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me. -- jeremiah 33:8
.
'It will be to Me a name of joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth which will hear of all the good that I do for them, and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.' -- jeremiah 33:9
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'Yet again there will be heard in this place, of which you say, "It is a waste, without man and without beast," that is, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast, -- jeremiah 33:10
.
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, "Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good, For His lovingkindness is everlasting"; and of those who bring a thank offering into the house of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,' says the LORD. -- jeremiah 33:11
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'There will again be in this place which is waste, without man or beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds who rest their flocks. -- jeremiah 33:12
.
'In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the Negev, in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who numbers them,' says the LORD. -- jeremiah 33:13
.
'Behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah. -- jeremiah 33:14
.
'In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to spring forth; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth. -- jeremiah 33:15
.
'In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell in safety; and this is the name by which she will be called: the LORD is our righteousness.' -- jeremiah 33:16
.
"For thus says the LORD, 'David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel; -- jeremiah 33:17
.
and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to prepare sacrifices continually.'" -- jeremiah 33:18
.
The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 33:19
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time, -- jeremiah 33:20
.
then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers. -- jeremiah 33:21
.
'As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.'" -- jeremiah 33:22
.
And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 33:23
.
"Have you not observed what this people have spoken, saying, 'The two families which the LORD chose, He has rejected them'? Thus they despise My people, no longer are they as a nation in their sight. -- jeremiah 33:24
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'If My covenant for day and night stand not, and the fixed patterns of heaven and earth I have not established, -- jeremiah 33:25
.
then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them.'" -- jeremiah 33:26
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying, -- jeremiah 34:1
.
"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him: "Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire. -- jeremiah 34:2
.
'You will not escape from his hand, for you will surely be captured and delivered into his hand; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.'"' -- jeremiah 34:3
.
"Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you, 'You will not die by the sword. -- jeremiah 34:4
.
'You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will lament for you, "Alas, lord!"' For I have spoken the word," declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 34:5
.
Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem -- jeremiah 34:6
.
when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, that is, Lachish and Azekah, for they alone remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah. -- jeremiah 34:7
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them: -- jeremiah 34:8
.
that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman; so that no one should keep them, a Jew his brother, in bondage. -- jeremiah 34:9
.
And all the officials and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, so that no one should keep them any longer in bondage; they obeyed, and set them free. -- jeremiah 34:10
.
But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection for male servants and for female servants. -- jeremiah 34:11
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, -- jeremiah 34:12
.
"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'I made a covenant with your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, saying, -- jeremiah 34:13
.
"At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you and has served you six years, you shall send him out free from you; but your forefathers did not obey Me or incline their ear to Me. -- jeremiah 34:14
.
"Although recently you had turned and done what is right in My sight, each man proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name. -- jeremiah 34:15
.
"Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each man took back his male servant and each man his female servant whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male servants and female servants."' -- jeremiah 34:16
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD, 'You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release each man to his brother and each man to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming a release to you,' declares the LORD, 'to the sword, to the pestilence and to the famine; and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth. -- jeremiah 34:17
.
'I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts-- -- jeremiah 34:18
.
the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the court officers and the priests and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf-- -- jeremiah 34:19
.
I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth. -- jeremiah 34:20
.
'Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has gone away from you. -- jeremiah 34:21
.
'Behold, I am going to command,' declares the LORD, 'and I will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.'" -- jeremiah 34:22
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, -- jeremiah 35:1
.
"Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink." -- jeremiah 35:2
.
Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites, -- jeremiah 35:3
.
and I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the doorkeeper. -- jeremiah 35:4
.
Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine and cups; and I said to them, "Drink wine!" -- jeremiah 35:5
.
But they said, "We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, 'You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever. -- jeremiah 35:6
.
'You shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed and you shall not plant a vineyard or own one; but in tents you shall dwell all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.' -- jeremiah 35:7
.
"We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons or our daughters, -- jeremiah 35:8
.
nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; and we do not have vineyard or field or seed. -- jeremiah 35:9
.
"We have only dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and have done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. -- jeremiah 35:10
.
"But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come and let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans and before the army of the Arameans.' So we have dwelt in Jerusalem." -- jeremiah 35:11
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 35:12
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "Will you not receive instruction by listening to My words?" declares the LORD. -- jeremiah 35:13
.
"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are observed. So they do not drink wine to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. But I have spoken to you again and again; yet you have not listened to Me. -- jeremiah 35:14
.
"Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them again and again, saying: 'Turn now every man from his evil way and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to worship them. Then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your forefathers; but you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me. -- jeremiah 35:15
.
'Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the command of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to Me.'"' -- jeremiah 35:16
.
"Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I spoke to them but they did not listen, and I have called them but they did not answer.'" -- jeremiah 35:17
.
Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, kept all his commands and done according to all that he commanded you; -- jeremiah 35:18
.
therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me always."'" -- jeremiah 35:19
.
In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, -- jeremiah 36:1
.
"Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. -- jeremiah 36:2
.
"Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity which I plan to bring on them, in order that every man will turn from his evil way; then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin." -- jeremiah 36:3
.
Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD which He had spoken to him. -- jeremiah 36:4
.
Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, "I am restricted; I cannot go into the house of the LORD. -- jeremiah 36:5
.
"So you go and read from the scroll which you have written at my dictation the words of the LORD to the people in the LORD'S house on a fast day. And also you shall read them to all the people of Judah who come from their cities. -- jeremiah 36:6
.
"Perhaps their supplication will come before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people." -- jeremiah 36:7
.
Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house. -- jeremiah 36:8
.
Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD. -- jeremiah 36:9
.
Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD'S house, to all the people. -- jeremiah 36:10
.
Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the LORD from the book, -- jeremiah 36:11
.
he went down to the king's house, into the scribe's chamber. And behold, all the officials were sitting there--Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. -- jeremiah 36:12
.
Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people. -- jeremiah 36:13
.
Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, "Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them. -- jeremiah 36:14
.
They said to him, "Sit down, please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them. -- jeremiah 36:15
.
When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch, "We will surely report all these words to the king." -- jeremiah 36:16
.
And they asked Baruch, saying, "Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?" -- jeremiah 36:17
.
Then Baruch said to them, "He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book." -- jeremiah 36:18
.
Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are." -- jeremiah 36:19
.
So they went to the king in the court, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they reported all the words to the king. -- jeremiah 36:20
.
Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king. -- jeremiah 36:21
.
Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him. -- jeremiah 36:22
.
When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with a scribe's knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. -- jeremiah 36:23
.
Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments. -- jeremiah 36:24
.
Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. -- jeremiah 36:25
.
And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them. -- jeremiah 36:26
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying, -- jeremiah 36:27
.
"Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned. -- jeremiah 36:28
.
"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD, "You have burned this scroll, saying, 'Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will make man and beast to cease from it?'" -- jeremiah 36:29
.
'Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, "He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. -- jeremiah 36:30
.
"I will also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the calamity that I have declared to them--but they did not listen."'" -- jeremiah 36:31
.
Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them. -- jeremiah 36:32
.
Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim. -- jeremiah 37:1
.
But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet. -- jeremiah 37:2
.
Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "Please pray to the LORD our God on our behalf." -- jeremiah 37:3
.
Now Jeremiah was still coming in and going out among the people, for they had not yet put him in the prison. -- jeremiah 37:4
.
Meanwhile, Pharaoh's army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the siege from Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 37:5
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, -- jeremiah 37:6
.
"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Thus you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: "Behold, Pharaoh's army which has come out for your assistance is going to return to its own land of Egypt. -- jeremiah 37:7
.
"The Chaldeans will also return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire."' -- jeremiah 37:8
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans will surely go away from us," for they will not go. -- jeremiah 37:9
.
'For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were only wounded men left among them, each man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'" -- jeremiah 37:10
.
Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army, -- jeremiah 37:11
.
that Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to take possession of some property there among the people. -- jeremiah 37:12
.
While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are going over to the Chaldeans!" -- jeremiah 37:13
.
But Jeremiah said, "A lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans"; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. -- jeremiah 37:14
.
Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him, and they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into the prison. -- jeremiah 37:15
.
For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days. -- jeremiah 37:16
.
Now King Zedekiah sent and took him out; and in his palace the king secretly asked him and said, "Is there a word from the LORD?" And Jeremiah said, "There is!" Then he said, "You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon!" -- jeremiah 37:17
.
Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "In what way have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? -- jeremiah 37:18
.
"Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land'? -- jeremiah 37:19
.
"But now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my petition come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there." -- jeremiah 37:20
.
Then King Zedekiah gave commandment, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guardhouse and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse. -- jeremiah 37:21
.
Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying, -- jeremiah 38:1
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'He who stays in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live and have his own life as booty and stay alive.' -- jeremiah 38:2
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'This city will certainly be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.'" -- jeremiah 38:3
.
Then the officials said to the king, "Now let this man be put to death, inasmuch as he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the well-being of this people but rather their harm." -- jeremiah 38:4
.
So King Zedekiah said, "Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you." -- jeremiah 38:5
.
Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchijah the king's son, which was in the court of the guardhouse; and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud. -- jeremiah 38:6
.
But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king's palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin; -- jeremiah 38:7
.
and Ebed-melech went out from the king's palace and spoke to the king, saying, -- jeremiah 38:8
.
"My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the cistern; and he will die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city." -- jeremiah 38:9
.
Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, "Take thirty men from here under your authority and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies." -- jeremiah 38:10
.
So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king's palace to a place beneath the storeroom and took from there worn-out clothes and worn-out rags and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah. -- jeremiah 38:11
.
Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes"; and Jeremiah did so. -- jeremiah 38:12
.
So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse. -- jeremiah 38:13
.
Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the LORD; and the king said to Jeremiah, "I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me." -- jeremiah 38:14
.
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me." -- jeremiah 38:15
.
But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret saying, "As the LORD lives, who made this life for us, surely I will not put you to death nor will I give you over to the hand of these men who are seeking your life." -- jeremiah 38:16
.
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'If you will indeed go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will survive. -- jeremiah 38:17
.
'But if you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given over to the hand of the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.'" -- jeremiah 38:18
.
Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I dread the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldeans, for they may give me over into their hand and they will abuse me." -- jeremiah 38:19
.
But Jeremiah said, "They will not give you over. Please obey the LORD in what I am saying to you, that it may go well with you and you may live. -- jeremiah 38:20
.
"But if you keep refusing to go out, this is the word which the LORD has shown me: -- jeremiah 38:21
.
'Then behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and those women will say, "Your close friends Have misled and overpowered you; While your feet were sunk in the mire, They turned back." -- jeremiah 38:22
.
'They will also bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.'" -- jeremiah 38:23
.
Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no man know about these words and you will not die. -- jeremiah 38:24
.
"But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us and we will not put you to death,' -- jeremiah 38:25
.
then you are to say to them, 'I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.'" -- jeremiah 38:26
.
Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and they ceased speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard. -- jeremiah 38:27
.
So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured. -- jeremiah 38:28
.
Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it; -- jeremiah 39:1
.
in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the city wall was breached. -- jeremiah 39:2
.
Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon. -- jeremiah 39:3
.
When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah. -- jeremiah 39:4
.
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. -- jeremiah 39:5
.
Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah. -- jeremiah 39:6
.
He then blinded Zedekiah's eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon. -- jeremiah 39:7
.
The Chaldeans also burned with fire the king's palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem. -- jeremiah 39:8
.
As for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried them into exile in Babylon. -- jeremiah 39:9
.
But some of the poorest people who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time. -- jeremiah 39:10
.
Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying, -- jeremiah 39:11
.
"Take him and look after him, and do nothing harmful to him, but rather deal with him just as he tells you." -- jeremiah 39:12
.
So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent word, along with Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon; -- jeremiah 39:13
.
they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he stayed among the people. -- jeremiah 39:14
.
Now the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the guardhouse, saying, -- jeremiah 39:15
.
"Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Behold, I am about to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity; and they will take place before you on that day. -- jeremiah 39:16
.
"But I will deliver you on that day," declares the LORD, "and you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you dread. -- jeremiah 39:17
.
"For I will certainly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but you will have your own life as booty, because you have trusted in Me," declares the LORD.'" -- jeremiah 39:18
.
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan captain of the bodyguard had released him from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon. -- jeremiah 40:1
.
Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God promised this calamity against this place; -- jeremiah 40:2
.
and the LORD has brought it on and done just as He promised. Because you people sinned against the LORD and did not listen to His voice, therefore this thing has happened to you. -- jeremiah 40:3
.
"But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains which are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along, and I will look after you; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon, never mind. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go." -- jeremiah 40:4
.
As Jeremiah was still not going back, he said, "Go on back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go anywhere it seems right for you to go." So the captain of the bodyguard gave him a ration and a gift and let him go. -- jeremiah 40:5
.
Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land. -- jeremiah 40:6
.
Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon. -- jeremiah 40:7
.
So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, both they and their men. -- jeremiah 40:8
.
Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, "Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you. -- jeremiah 40:9
.
"Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay at Mizpah to stand for you before the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather in wine and summer fruit and oil and put them in your storage vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken over." -- jeremiah 40:10
.
Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the other countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. -- jeremiah 40:11
.
Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven away and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered in wine and summer fruit in great abundance. -- jeremiah 40:12
.
Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah -- jeremiah 40:13
.
and said to him, "Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them. -- jeremiah 40:14
.
Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, "Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and not a man will know! Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered and the remnant of Judah would perish?" -- jeremiah 40:15
.
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "Do not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael." -- jeremiah 40:16
.
In the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, along with ten men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were eating bread together there in Mizpah, -- jeremiah 41:1
.
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. -- jeremiah 41:2
.
Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war. -- jeremiah 41:3
.
Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one knew about it, -- jeremiah 41:4
.
that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and their bodies gashed, having grain offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the LORD. -- jeremiah 41:5
.
Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went; and as he met them, he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!" -- jeremiah 41:6
.
Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men that were with him slaughtered them and cast them into the cistern. -- jeremiah 41:7
.
But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, "Do not put us to death; for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil and honey hidden in the field." So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions. -- jeremiah 41:8
.
Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had cast all the corpses of the men whom he had struck down because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. -- jeremiah 41:9
.
Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the charge of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; thus Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon. -- jeremiah 41:10
.
But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done. -- jeremiah 41:11
.
So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon. -- jeremiah 41:12
.
Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad. -- jeremiah 41:13
.
So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. -- jeremiah 41:14
.
But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon. -- jeremiah 41:15
.
Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, that is, the men who were soldiers, the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. -- jeremiah 41:16
.
And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt -- jeremiah 41:17
.
because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. -- jeremiah 41:18
.
Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people both small and great approached -- jeremiah 42:1
.
and said to Jeremiah the prophet, "Please let our petition come before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, that is for all this remnant; because we are left but a few out of many, as your own eyes now see us, -- jeremiah 42:2
.
that the LORD your God may tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do." -- jeremiah 42:3
.
Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Behold, I am going to pray to the LORD your God in accordance with your words; and I will tell you the whole message which the LORD will answer you. I will not keep back a word from you." -- jeremiah 42:4
.
Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which the LORD your God will send you to us. -- jeremiah 42:5
.
"Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the LORD our God." -- jeremiah 42:6
.
Now at the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. -- jeremiah 42:7
.
Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and for all the people both small and great, -- jeremiah 42:8
.
and said to them, "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him: -- jeremiah 42:9
.
'If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent concerning the calamity that I have inflicted on you. -- jeremiah 42:10
.
'Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are now fearing; do not be afraid of him,' declares the LORD, 'for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand. -- jeremiah 42:11
.
'I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil. -- jeremiah 42:12
.
'But if you are going to say, "We will not stay in this land," so as not to listen to the voice of the LORD your God, -- jeremiah 42:13
.
saying, "No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of a trumpet or hunger for bread, and we will stay there"; -- jeremiah 42:14
.
then in that case listen to the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "If you really set your mind to enter Egypt and go in to reside there, -- jeremiah 42:15
.
then the sword, which you are afraid of, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely after you there in Egypt, and you will die there. -- jeremiah 42:16
.
"So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence; and they will have no survivors or refugees from the calamity that I am going to bring on them."'" -- jeremiah 42:17
.
For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "As My anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach; and you will see this place no more." -- jeremiah 42:18
.
The LORD has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, "Do not go into Egypt!" You should clearly understand that today I have testified against you. -- jeremiah 42:19
.
For you have only deceived yourselves; for it is you who sent me to the LORD your God, saying, "Pray for us to the LORD our God; and whatever the LORD our God says, tell us so, and we will do it." -- jeremiah 42:20
.
So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the LORD your God, even in whatever He has sent me to tell you. -- jeremiah 42:21
.
Therefore you should now clearly understand that you will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence, in the place where you wish to go to reside. -- jeremiah 42:22
.
But as soon as Jeremiah, whom the LORD their God had sent, had finished telling all the people all the words of the LORD their God--that is, all these words-- -- jeremiah 43:1
.
Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You are telling a lie! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'You are not to enter Egypt to reside there'; -- jeremiah 43:2
.
