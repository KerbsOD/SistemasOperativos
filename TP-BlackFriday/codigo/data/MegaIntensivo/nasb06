My tongue also will utter Your righteousness all day long; For they are ashamed, for they are humiliated who seek my hurt. -- psalms 71:24
.
Give the king Your judgments, O God, And Your righteousness to the king's son. -- psalms 72:1
.
May he judge Your people with righteousness And Your afflicted with justice. -- psalms 72:2
.
Let the mountains bring peace to the people, And the hills, in righteousness. -- psalms 72:3
.
May he vindicate the afflicted of the people, Save the children of the needy And crush the oppressor. -- psalms 72:4
.
Let them fear You while the sun endures, And as long as the moon, throughout all generations. -- psalms 72:5
.
May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, Like showers that water the earth. -- psalms 72:6
.
In his days may the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace till the moon is no more. -- psalms 72:7
.
May he also rule from sea to sea And from the River to the ends of the earth. -- psalms 72:8
.
Let the nomads of the desert bow before him, And his enemies lick the dust. -- psalms 72:9
.
Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts. -- psalms 72:10
.
And let all kings bow down before him, All nations serve him. -- psalms 72:11
.
For he will deliver the needy when he cries for help, The afflicted also, and him who has no helper. -- psalms 72:12
.
He will have compassion on the poor and needy, And the lives of the needy he will save. -- psalms 72:13
.
He will rescue their life from oppression and violence, And their blood will be precious in his sight; -- psalms 72:14
.
So may he live, and may the gold of Sheba be given to him; And let them pray for him continually; Let them bless him all day long. -- psalms 72:15
.
May there be abundance of grain in the earth on top of the mountains; Its fruit will wave like the cedars of Lebanon; And may those from the city flourish like vegetation of the earth. -- psalms 72:16
.
May his name endure forever; May his name increase as long as the sun shines; And let men bless themselves by him; Let all nations call him blessed. -- psalms 72:17
.
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, Who alone works wonders. -- psalms 72:18
.
And blessed be His glorious name forever; And may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen. -- psalms 72:19
.
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. -- psalms 72:20
.
Surely God is good to Israel, To those who are pure in heart! -- psalms 73:1
.
But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling, My steps had almost slipped. -- psalms 73:2
.
For I was envious of the arrogant As I saw the prosperity of the wicked. -- psalms 73:3
.
For there are no pains in their death, And their body is fat. -- psalms 73:4
.
They are not in trouble as other men, Nor are they plagued like mankind. -- psalms 73:5
.
Therefore pride is their necklace; The garment of violence covers them. -- psalms 73:6
.
Their eye bulges from fatness; The imaginations of their heart run riot. -- psalms 73:7
.
They mock and wickedly speak of oppression; They speak from on high. -- psalms 73:8
.
They have set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue parades through the earth. -- psalms 73:9
.
Therefore his people return to this place, And waters of abundance are drunk by them. -- psalms 73:10
.
They say, "How does God know? And is there knowledge with the Most High?" -- psalms 73:11
.
Behold, these are the wicked; And always at ease, they have increased in wealth. -- psalms 73:12
.
Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure And washed my hands in innocence; -- psalms 73:13
.
For I have been stricken all day long And chastened every morning. -- psalms 73:14
.
If I had said, "I will speak thus," Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of Your children. -- psalms 73:15
.
When I pondered to understand this, It was troublesome in my sight -- psalms 73:16
.
Until I came into the sanctuary of God; Then I perceived their end. -- psalms 73:17
.
Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction. -- psalms 73:18
.
How they are destroyed in a moment! They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors! -- psalms 73:19
.
Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when aroused, You will despise their form. -- psalms 73:20
.
When my heart was embittered And I was pierced within, -- psalms 73:21
.
Then I was senseless and ignorant; I was like a beast before You. -- psalms 73:22
.
Nevertheless I am continually with You; You have taken hold of my right hand. -- psalms 73:23
.
With Your counsel You will guide me, And afterward receive me to glory. -- psalms 73:24
.
Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. -- psalms 73:25
.
My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. -- psalms 73:26
.
For, behold, those who are far from You will perish; You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to You. -- psalms 73:27
.
But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, That I may tell of all Your works. -- psalms 73:28
.
O God, why have You rejected us forever? Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture? -- psalms 74:1
.
Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old, Which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your inheritance; And this Mount Zion, where You have dwelt. -- psalms 74:2
.
Turn Your footsteps toward the perpetual ruins; The enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary. -- psalms 74:3
.
Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your meeting place; They have set up their own standards for signs. -- psalms 74:4
.
It seems as if one had lifted up His axe in a forest of trees. -- psalms 74:5
.
And now all its carved work They smash with hatchet and hammers. -- psalms 74:6
.
They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name. -- psalms 74:7
.
They said in their heart, "Let us completely subdue them." They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land. -- psalms 74:8
.
We do not see our signs; There is no longer any prophet, Nor is there any among us who knows how long. -- psalms 74:9
.
How long, O God, will the adversary revile, And the enemy spurn Your name forever? -- psalms 74:10
.
Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? From within Your bosom, destroy them! -- psalms 74:11
.
Yet God is my king from of old, Who works deeds of deliverance in the midst of the earth. -- psalms 74:12
.
You divided the sea by Your strength; You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. -- psalms 74:13
.
You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness. -- psalms 74:14
.
You broke open springs and torrents; You dried up ever-flowing streams. -- psalms 74:15
.
Yours is the day, Yours also is the night; You have prepared the light and the sun. -- psalms 74:16
.
You have established all the boundaries of the earth; You have made summer and winter. -- psalms 74:17
.
Remember this, O LORD, that the enemy has reviled, And a foolish people has spurned Your name. -- psalms 74:18
.
Do not deliver the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beast; Do not forget the life of Your afflicted forever. -- psalms 74:19
.
Consider the covenant; For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. -- psalms 74:20
.
Let not the oppressed return dishonored; Let the afflicted and needy praise Your name. -- psalms 74:21
.
Arise, O God, and plead Your own cause; Remember how the foolish man reproaches You all day long. -- psalms 74:22
.
Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries, The uproar of those who rise against You which ascends continually. -- psalms 74:23
.
We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks, For Your name is near; Men declare Your wondrous works. -- psalms 75:1
.
"When I select an appointed time, It is I who judge with equity. -- psalms 75:2
.
"The earth and all who dwell in it melt; It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah. -- psalms 75:3
.
"I said to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn; -- psalms 75:4
.
Do not lift up your horn on high, Do not speak with insolent pride.'" -- psalms 75:5
.
For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert comes exaltation; -- psalms 75:6
.
But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another. -- psalms 75:7
.
For a cup is in the hand of the LORD, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs. -- psalms 75:8
.
But as for me, I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. -- psalms 75:9
.
And all the horns of the wicked He will cut off, But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up. -- psalms 75:10
.
God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel. -- psalms 76:1
.
His tabernacle is in Salem; His dwelling place also is in Zion. -- psalms 76:2
.
There He broke the flaming arrows, The shield and the sword and the weapons of war. Selah. -- psalms 76:3
.
You are resplendent, More majestic than the mountains of prey. -- psalms 76:4
.
The stouthearted were plundered, They sank into sleep; And none of the warriors could use his hands. -- psalms 76:5
.
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep. -- psalms 76:6
.
You, even You, are to be feared; And who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry? -- psalms 76:7
.
You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still -- psalms 76:8
.
When God arose to judgment, To save all the humble of the earth. Selah. -- psalms 76:9
.
For the wrath of man shall praise You; With a remnant of wrath You will gird Yourself. -- psalms 76:10
.
Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared. -- psalms 76:11
.
He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth. -- psalms 76:12
.
My voice rises to God, and I will cry aloud; My voice rises to God, and He will hear me. -- psalms 77:1
.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness; My soul refused to be comforted. -- psalms 77:2
.
When I remember God, then I am disturbed; When I sigh, then my spirit grows faint. Selah. -- psalms 77:3
.
You have held my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. -- psalms 77:4
.
I have considered the days of old, The years of long ago. -- psalms 77:5
.
I will remember my song in the night; I will meditate with my heart, And my spirit ponders: -- psalms 77:6
.
Will the Lord reject forever? And will He never be favorable again? -- psalms 77:7
.
Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? Has His promise come to an end forever? -- psalms 77:8
.
Has God forgotten to be gracious, Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah. -- psalms 77:9
.
Then I said, "It is my grief, That the right hand of the Most High has changed." -- psalms 77:10
.
I shall remember the deeds of the LORD; Surely I will remember Your wonders of old. -- psalms 77:11
.
I will meditate on all Your work And muse on Your deeds. -- psalms 77:12
.
Your way, O God, is holy; What god is great like our God? -- psalms 77:13
.
You are the God who works wonders; You have made known Your strength among the peoples. -- psalms 77:14
.
You have by Your power redeemed Your people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. -- psalms 77:15
.
The waters saw You, O God; The waters saw You, they were in anguish; The deeps also trembled. -- psalms 77:16
.
The clouds poured out water; The skies gave forth a sound; Your arrows flashed here and there. -- psalms 77:17
.
The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook. -- psalms 77:18
.
Your way was in the sea And Your paths in the mighty waters, And Your footprints may not be known. -- psalms 77:19
.
You led Your people like a flock By the hand of Moses and Aaron. -- psalms 77:20
.
Listen, O my people, to my instruction; Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. -- psalms 78:1
.
I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old, -- psalms 78:2
.
Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us. -- psalms 78:3
.
We will not conceal them from their children, But tell to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, And His strength and His wondrous works that He has done. -- psalms 78:4
.
For He established a testimony in Jacob And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers That they should teach them to their children, -- psalms 78:5
.
That the generation to come might know, even the children yet to be born, That they may arise and tell them to their children, -- psalms 78:6
.
That they should put their confidence in God And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments, -- psalms 78:7
.
And not be like their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not prepare its heart And whose spirit was not faithful to God. -- psalms 78:8
.
The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows, Yet they turned back in the day of battle. -- psalms 78:9
.
They did not keep the covenant of God And refused to walk in His law; -- psalms 78:10
.
They forgot His deeds And His miracles that He had shown them. -- psalms 78:11
.
He wrought wonders before their fathers In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. -- psalms 78:12
.
He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, And He made the waters stand up like a heap. -- psalms 78:13
.
Then He led them with the cloud by day And all the night with a light of fire. -- psalms 78:14
.
He split the rocks in the wilderness And gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths. -- psalms 78:15
.
He brought forth streams also from the rock And caused waters to run down like rivers. -- psalms 78:16
.
Yet they still continued to sin against Him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert. -- psalms 78:17
.
And in their heart they put God to the test By asking food according to their desire. -- psalms 78:18
.
Then they spoke against God; They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? -- psalms 78:19
.
"Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, And streams were overflowing; Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?" -- psalms 78:20
.
Therefore the LORD heard and was full of wrath; And a fire was kindled against Jacob And anger also mounted against Israel, -- psalms 78:21
.
Because they did not believe in God And did not trust in His salvation. -- psalms 78:22
.
Yet He commanded the clouds above And opened the doors of heaven; -- psalms 78:23
.
He rained down manna upon them to eat And gave them food from heaven. -- psalms 78:24
.
Man did eat the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance. -- psalms 78:25
.
He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens And by His power He directed the south wind. -- psalms 78:26
.
When He rained meat upon them like the dust, Even winged fowl like the sand of the seas, -- psalms 78:27
.
Then He let them fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their dwellings. -- psalms 78:28
.
So they ate and were well filled, And their desire He gave to them. -- psalms 78:29
.
Before they had satisfied their desire, While their food was in their mouths, -- psalms 78:30
.
The anger of God rose against them And killed some of their stoutest ones, And subdued the choice men of Israel. -- psalms 78:31
.
In spite of all this they still sinned And did not believe in His wonderful works. -- psalms 78:32
.
So He brought their days to an end in futility And their years in sudden terror. -- psalms 78:33
.
When He killed them, then they sought Him, And returned and searched diligently for God; -- psalms 78:34
.
And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their Redeemer. -- psalms 78:35
.
But they deceived Him with their mouth And lied to Him with their tongue. -- psalms 78:36
.
For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, Nor were they faithful in His covenant. -- psalms 78:37
.
But He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them; And often He restrained His anger And did not arouse all His wrath. -- psalms 78:38
.
Thus He remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passes and does not return. -- psalms 78:39
.
How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness And grieved Him in the desert! -- psalms 78:40
.
Again and again they tempted God, And pained the Holy One of Israel. -- psalms 78:41
.
They did not remember His power, The day when He redeemed them from the adversary, -- psalms 78:42
.
When He performed His signs in Egypt And His marvels in the field of Zoan, -- psalms 78:43
.
And turned their rivers to blood, And their streams, they could not drink. -- psalms 78:44
.
He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them, And frogs which destroyed them. -- psalms 78:45
.
He gave also their crops to the grasshopper And the product of their labor to the locust. -- psalms 78:46
.
He destroyed their vines with hailstones And their sycamore trees with frost. -- psalms 78:47
.
He gave over their cattle also to the hailstones And their herds to bolts of lightning. -- psalms 78:48
.
He sent upon them His burning anger, Fury and indignation and trouble, A band of destroying angels. -- psalms 78:49
.
He leveled a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, But gave over their life to the plague, -- psalms 78:50
.
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, The first issue of their virility in the tents of Ham. -- psalms 78:51
.
But He led forth His own people like sheep And guided them in the wilderness like a flock; -- psalms 78:52
.
He led them safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea engulfed their enemies. -- psalms 78:53
.
So He brought them to His holy land, To this hill country which His right hand had gained. -- psalms 78:54
.
He also drove out the nations before them And apportioned them for an inheritance by measurement, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents. -- psalms 78:55
.
Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God And did not keep His testimonies, -- psalms 78:56
.
But turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers; They turned aside like a treacherous bow. -- psalms 78:57
.
For they provoked Him with their high places And aroused His jealousy with their graven images. -- psalms 78:58
.
When God heard, He was filled with wrath And greatly abhorred Israel; -- psalms 78:59
.
So that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, The tent which He had pitched among men, -- psalms 78:60
.
And gave up His strength to captivity And His glory into the hand of the adversary. -- psalms 78:61
.
He also delivered His people to the sword, And was filled with wrath at His inheritance. -- psalms 78:62
.
Fire devoured His young men, And His virgins had no wedding songs. -- psalms 78:63
.
His priests fell by the sword, And His widows could not weep. -- psalms 78:64
.
Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, Like a warrior overcome by wine. -- psalms 78:65
.
He drove His adversaries backward; He put on them an everlasting reproach. -- psalms 78:66
.
He also rejected the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, -- psalms 78:67
.
But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved. -- psalms 78:68
.
And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He has founded forever. -- psalms 78:69
.
He also chose David His servant And took him from the sheepfolds; -- psalms 78:70
.
From the care of the ewes with suckling lambs He brought him To shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel His inheritance. -- psalms 78:71
.
So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them with his skillful hands. -- psalms 78:72
.
O God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance; They have defiled Your holy temple; They have laid Jerusalem in ruins. -- psalms 79:1
.
They have given the dead bodies of Your servants for food to the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth. -- psalms 79:2
.
They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem; And there was no one to bury them. -- psalms 79:3
.
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to those around us. -- psalms 79:4
.
How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire? -- psalms 79:5
.
Pour out Your wrath upon the nations which do not know You, And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Your name. -- psalms 79:6
.
For they have devoured Jacob And laid waste his habitation. -- psalms 79:7
.
Do not remember the iniquities of our forefathers against us; Let Your compassion come quickly to meet us, For we are brought very low. -- psalms 79:8
.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; And deliver us and forgive our sins for Your name's sake. -- psalms 79:9
.
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let there be known among the nations in our sight, Vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been shed. -- psalms 79:10
.
Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; According to the greatness of Your power preserve those who are doomed to die. -- psalms 79:11
.
And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom The reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord. -- psalms 79:12
.
So we Your people and the sheep of Your pasture Will give thanks to You forever; To all generations we will tell of Your praise. -- psalms 79:13
.
Oh, give ear, Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You who are enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth! -- psalms 80:1
.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your power And come to save us! -- psalms 80:2
.
O God, restore us And cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved. -- psalms 80:3
.
O LORD God of hosts, How long will You be angry with the prayer of Your people? -- psalms 80:4
.
You have fed them with the bread of tears, And You have made them to drink tears in large measure. -- psalms 80:5
.
You make us an object of contention to our neighbors, And our enemies laugh among themselves. -- psalms 80:6
.
O God of hosts, restore us And cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved. -- psalms 80:7
.
You removed a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and planted it. -- psalms 80:8
.
You cleared the ground before it, And it took deep root and filled the land. -- psalms 80:9
.
The mountains were covered with its shadow, And the cedars of God with its boughs. -- psalms 80:10
.
It was sending out its branches to the sea And its shoots to the River. -- psalms 80:11
.
Why have You broken down its hedges, So that all who pass that way pick its fruit? -- psalms 80:12
.
A boar from the forest eats it away And whatever moves in the field feeds on it. -- psalms 80:13
.
O God of hosts, turn again now, we beseech You; Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine, -- psalms 80:14
.
Even the shoot which Your right hand has planted, And on the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself. -- psalms 80:15
.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance. -- psalms 80:16
.
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself. -- psalms 80:17
.
Then we shall not turn back from You; Revive us, and we will call upon Your name. -- psalms 80:18
.
O LORD God of hosts, restore us; Cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved. -- psalms 80:19
.
Sing for joy to God our strength; Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob. -- psalms 81:1
.
Raise a song, strike the timbrel, The sweet sounding lyre with the harp. -- psalms 81:2
.
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast day. -- psalms 81:3
.
For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob. -- psalms 81:4
.
He established it for a testimony in Joseph When he went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard a language that I did not know: -- psalms 81:5
.
"I relieved his shoulder of the burden, His hands were freed from the basket. -- psalms 81:6
.
"You called in trouble and I rescued you; I answered you in the hiding place of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah. -- psalms 81:7
.
"Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you; O Israel, if you would listen to Me! -- psalms 81:8
.
"Let there be no strange god among you; Nor shall you worship any foreign god. -- psalms 81:9
.
"I, the LORD, am your God, Who brought you up from the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide and I will fill it. -- psalms 81:10
.
"But My people did not listen to My voice, And Israel did not obey Me. -- psalms 81:11
.
"So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart, To walk in their own devices. -- psalms 81:12
.
"Oh that My people would listen to Me, That Israel would walk in My ways! -- psalms 81:13
.
"I would quickly subdue their enemies And turn My hand against their adversaries. -- psalms 81:14
.
"Those who hate the LORD would pretend obedience to Him, And their time of punishment would be forever. -- psalms 81:15
.
"But I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you." -- psalms 81:16
.
God takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers. -- psalms 82:1
.
How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? Selah. -- psalms 82:2
.
Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute. -- psalms 82:3
.
Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. -- psalms 82:4
.
They do not know nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken. -- psalms 82:5
.
I said, "You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High. -- psalms 82:6
.
"Nevertheless you will die like men And fall like any one of the princes." -- psalms 82:7
.
Arise, O God, judge the earth! For it is You who possesses all the nations. -- psalms 82:8
.
O God, do not remain quiet; Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still. -- psalms 83:1
.
For behold, Your enemies make an uproar, And those who hate You have exalted themselves. -- psalms 83:2
.
They make shrewd plans against Your people, And conspire together against Your treasured ones. -- psalms 83:3
.
They have said, "Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation, That the name of Israel be remembered no more." -- psalms 83:4
.
For they have conspired together with one mind; Against You they make a covenant: -- psalms 83:5
.
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites; -- psalms 83:6
.
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; -- psalms 83:7
.
Assyria also has joined with them; They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah. -- psalms 83:8
.
Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera and Jabin at the torrent of Kishon, -- psalms 83:9
.
Who were destroyed at En-dor, Who became as dung for the ground. -- psalms 83:10
.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, -- psalms 83:11
.
Who said, "Let us possess for ourselves The pastures of God." -- psalms 83:12
.
O my God, make them like the whirling dust, Like chaff before the wind. -- psalms 83:13
.
Like fire that burns the forest And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire, -- psalms 83:14
.
So pursue them with Your tempest And terrify them with Your storm. -- psalms 83:15
.
Fill their faces with dishonor, That they may seek Your name, O LORD. -- psalms 83:16
.
Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever, And let them be humiliated and perish, -- psalms 83:17
.
That they may know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, Are the Most High over all the earth. -- psalms 83:18
.
How lovely are Your dwelling places, O LORD of hosts! -- psalms 84:1
.
My soul longed and even yearned for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God. -- psalms 84:2
.
The bird also has found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even Your altars, O LORD of hosts, My King and my God. -- psalms 84:3
.
How blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You. Selah. -- psalms 84:4
.
How blessed is the man whose strength is in You, In whose heart are the highways to Zion! -- psalms 84:5
.
Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a spring; The early rain also covers it with blessings. -- psalms 84:6
.
They go from strength to strength, Every one of them appears before God in Zion. -- psalms 84:7
.
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah. -- psalms 84:8
.
Behold our shield, O God, And look upon the face of Your anointed. -- psalms 84:9
.
For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand outside. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness. -- psalms 84:10
.
For the LORD God is a sun and shield; The LORD gives grace and glory; No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly. -- psalms 84:11
.
O LORD of hosts, How blessed is the man who trusts in You! -- psalms 84:12
.
O LORD, You showed favor to Your land; You restored the captivity of Jacob. -- psalms 85:1
.
You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah. -- psalms 85:2
.
You withdrew all Your fury; You turned away from Your burning anger. -- psalms 85:3
.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, And cause Your indignation toward us to cease. -- psalms 85:4
.
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger to all generations? -- psalms 85:5
.
Will You not Yourself revive us again, That Your people may rejoice in You? -- psalms 85:6
.
Show us Your lovingkindness, O LORD, And grant us Your salvation. -- psalms 85:7
.
I will hear what God the LORD will say; For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones; But let them not turn back to folly. -- psalms 85:8
.
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land. -- psalms 85:9
.
Lovingkindness and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. -- psalms 85:10
.
Truth springs from the earth, And righteousness looks down from heaven. -- psalms 85:11
.
Indeed, the LORD will give what is good, And our land will yield its produce. -- psalms 85:12
.
Righteousness will go before Him And will make His footsteps into a way. -- psalms 85:13
.
Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me; For I am afflicted and needy. -- psalms 86:1
.
Preserve my soul, for I am a godly man; O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You. -- psalms 86:2
.
Be gracious to me, O Lord, For to You I cry all day long. -- psalms 86:3
.
Make glad the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul. -- psalms 86:4
.
For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You. -- psalms 86:5
.
Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And give heed to the voice of my supplications! -- psalms 86:6
.
In the day of my trouble I shall call upon You, For You will answer me. -- psalms 86:7
.
There is no one like You among the gods, O Lord, Nor are there any works like Yours. -- psalms 86:8
.
All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And they shall glorify Your name. -- psalms 86:9
.
For You are great and do wondrous deeds; You alone are God. -- psalms 86:10
.
Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name. -- psalms 86:11
.
I will give thanks to You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And will glorify Your name forever. -- psalms 86:12
.
For Your lovingkindness toward me is great, And You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. -- psalms 86:13
.
O God, arrogant men have risen up against me, And a band of violent men have sought my life, And they have not set You before them. -- psalms 86:14
.
But You, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth. -- psalms 86:15
.
Turn to me, and be gracious to me; Oh grant Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your handmaid. -- psalms 86:16
.
Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, Because You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me. -- psalms 86:17
.
His foundation is in the holy mountains. -- psalms 87:1
.
The LORD loves the gates of Zion More than all the other dwelling places of Jacob. -- psalms 87:2
.
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah. -- psalms 87:3
.
"I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia: 'This one was born there.'" -- psalms 87:4
.
But of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; And the Most High Himself will establish her. -- psalms 87:5
.
The LORD will count when He registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah. -- psalms 87:6
.
Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes shall say, "All my springs of joy are in you." -- psalms 87:7
.
O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried out by day and in the night before You. -- psalms 88:1
.
Let my prayer come before You; Incline Your ear to my cry! -- psalms 88:2
.
For my soul has had enough troubles, And my life has drawn near to Sheol. -- psalms 88:3
.
I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit; I have become like a man without strength, -- psalms 88:4
.
Forsaken among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom You remember no more, And they are cut off from Your hand. -- psalms 88:5
.
You have put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the depths. -- psalms 88:6
.
Your wrath has rested upon me, And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah. -- psalms 88:7
.
You have removed my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an object of loathing to them; I am shut up and cannot go out. -- psalms 88:8
.
My eye has wasted away because of affliction; I have called upon You every day, O LORD; I have spread out my hands to You. -- psalms 88:9
.
Will You perform wonders for the dead? Will the departed spirits rise and praise You? Selah. -- psalms 88:10
.
Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon? -- psalms 88:11
.
Will Your wonders be made known in the darkness? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? -- psalms 88:12
.
But I, O LORD, have cried out to You for help, And in the morning my prayer comes before You. -- psalms 88:13
.
O LORD, why do You reject my soul? Why do You hide Your face from me? -- psalms 88:14
.
I was afflicted and about to die from my youth on; I suffer Your terrors; I am overcome. -- psalms 88:15
.
Your burning anger has passed over me; Your terrors have destroyed me. -- psalms 88:16
.
They have surrounded me like water all day long; They have encompassed me altogether. -- psalms 88:17
.
You have removed lover and friend far from me; My acquaintances are in darkness. -- psalms 88:18
.
I will sing of the lovingkindness of the LORD forever; To all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth. -- psalms 89:1
.
For I have said, "Lovingkindness will be built up forever; In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness." -- psalms 89:2
.
"I have made a covenant with My chosen; I have sworn to David My servant, -- psalms 89:3
.
I will establish your seed forever And build up your throne to all generations." Selah. -- psalms 89:4
.
The heavens will praise Your wonders, O LORD; Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. -- psalms 89:5
.
For who in the skies is comparable to the LORD? Who among the sons of the mighty is like the LORD, -- psalms 89:6
.
A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, And awesome above all those who are around Him? -- psalms 89:7
.
O LORD God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty LORD? Your faithfulness also surrounds You. -- psalms 89:8
.
You rule the swelling of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them. -- psalms 89:9
.
You Yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm. -- psalms 89:10
.
The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours; The world and all it contains, You have founded them. -- psalms 89:11
.
The north and the south, You have created them; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name. -- psalms 89:12
.
You have a strong arm; Your hand is mighty, Your right hand is exalted. -- psalms 89:13
.
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; Lovingkindness and truth go before You. -- psalms 89:14
.
How blessed are the people who know the joyful sound! O LORD, they walk in the light of Your countenance. -- psalms 89:15
.
In Your name they rejoice all the day, And by Your righteousness they are exalted. -- psalms 89:16
.
For You are the glory of their strength, And by Your favor our horn is exalted. -- psalms 89:17
.
For our shield belongs to the LORD, And our king to the Holy One of Israel. -- psalms 89:18
.
Once You spoke in vision to Your godly ones, And said, "I have given help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people. -- psalms 89:19
.
"I have found David My servant; With My holy oil I have anointed him, -- psalms 89:20
.
With whom My hand will be established; My arm also will strengthen him. -- psalms 89:21
.
"The enemy will not deceive him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him. -- psalms 89:22
.
"But I shall crush his adversaries before him, And strike those who hate him. -- psalms 89:23
.
"My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with him, And in My name his horn will be exalted. -- psalms 89:24
.
"I shall also set his hand on the sea And his right hand on the rivers. -- psalms 89:25
.
"He will cry to Me, 'You are my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.' -- psalms 89:26
.
"I also shall make him My firstborn, The highest of the kings of the earth. -- psalms 89:27
.
"My lovingkindness I will keep for him forever, And My covenant shall be confirmed to him. -- psalms 89:28
.
"So I will establish his descendants forever And his throne as the days of heaven. -- psalms 89:29
.
"If his sons forsake My law And do not walk in My judgments, -- psalms 89:30
.
If they violate My statutes And do not keep My commandments, -- psalms 89:31
.
Then I will punish their transgression with the rod And their iniquity with stripes. -- psalms 89:32
.
"But I will not break off My lovingkindness from him, Nor deal falsely in My faithfulness. -- psalms 89:33
.
"My covenant I will not violate, Nor will I alter the utterance of My lips. -- psalms 89:34
.
"Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David. -- psalms 89:35
.
"His descendants shall endure forever And his throne as the sun before Me. -- psalms 89:36
.
"It shall be established forever like the moon, And the witness in the sky is faithful." Selah. -- psalms 89:37
.
But You have cast off and rejected, You have been full of wrath against Your anointed. -- psalms 89:38
.
You have spurned the covenant of Your servant; You have profaned his crown in the dust. -- psalms 89:39
.
You have broken down all his walls; You have brought his strongholds to ruin. -- psalms 89:40
.
All who pass along the way plunder him; He has become a reproach to his neighbors. -- psalms 89:41
.
You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; You have made all his enemies rejoice. -- psalms 89:42
.
You also turn back the edge of his sword And have not made him stand in battle. -- psalms 89:43
.
You have made his splendor to cease And cast his throne to the ground. -- psalms 89:44
.
You have shortened the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. Selah. -- psalms 89:45
.
How long, O LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath burn like fire? -- psalms 89:46
.
Remember what my span of life is; For what vanity You have created all the sons of men! -- psalms 89:47
.
What man can live and not see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah. -- psalms 89:48
.
Where are Your former lovingkindnesses, O Lord, Which You swore to David in Your faithfulness? -- psalms 89:49
.
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants; How I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the many peoples, -- psalms 89:50
.
With which Your enemies have reproached, O LORD, With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed. -- psalms 89:51
.
Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen. -- psalms 89:52
.
Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations. -- psalms 90:1
.
Before the mountains were born Or You gave birth to the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God. -- psalms 90:2
.
You turn man back into dust And say, "Return, O children of men." -- psalms 90:3
.
For a thousand years in Your sight Are like yesterday when it passes by, Or as a watch in the night. -- psalms 90:4
.
You have swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep; In the morning they are like grass which sprouts anew. -- psalms 90:5
.
In the morning it flourishes and sprouts anew; Toward evening it fades and withers away. -- psalms 90:6
.
For we have been consumed by Your anger And by Your wrath we have been dismayed. -- psalms 90:7
.
You have placed our iniquities before You, Our secret sins in the light of Your presence. -- psalms 90:8
.
For all our days have declined in Your fury; We have finished our years like a sigh. -- psalms 90:9
.
As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years, Or if due to strength, eighty years, Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow; For soon it is gone and we fly away. -- psalms 90:10
.
Who understands the power of Your anger And Your fury, according to the fear that is due You? -- psalms 90:11
.
So teach us to number our days, That we may present to You a heart of wisdom. -- psalms 90:12
.
Do return, O LORD; how long will it be? And be sorry for Your servants. -- psalms 90:13
.
O satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness, That we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. -- psalms 90:14
.
Make us glad according to the days You have afflicted us, And the years we have seen evil. -- psalms 90:15
.
Let Your work appear to Your servants And Your majesty to their children. -- psalms 90:16
.
Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And confirm for us the work of our hands; Yes, confirm the work of our hands. -- psalms 90:17
.
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty. -- psalms 91:1
.
I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust!" -- psalms 91:2
.
For it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper And from the deadly pestilence. -- psalms 91:3
.
He will cover you with His pinions, And under His wings you may seek refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and bulwark. -- psalms 91:4
.
You will not be afraid of the terror by night, Or of the arrow that flies by day; -- psalms 91:5
.
Of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, Or of the destruction that lays waste at noon. -- psalms 91:6
.
A thousand may fall at your side And ten thousand at your right hand, But it shall not approach you. -- psalms 91:7
.
You will only look on with your eyes And see the recompense of the wicked. -- psalms 91:8
.
For you have made the LORD, my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place. -- psalms 91:9
.
No evil will befall you, Nor will any plague come near your tent. -- psalms 91:10
.
For He will give His angels charge concerning you, To guard you in all your ways. -- psalms 91:11
.
They will bear you up in their hands, That you do not strike your foot against a stone. -- psalms 91:12
.
You will tread upon the lion and cobra, The young lion and the serpent you will trample down. -- psalms 91:13
.
"Because he has loved Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him securely on high, because he has known My name. -- psalms 91:14
.
"He will call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him. -- psalms 91:15
.
"With a long life I will satisfy him And let him see My salvation." -- psalms 91:16
.
It is good to give thanks to the LORD And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High; -- psalms 92:1
.
To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning And Your faithfulness by night, -- psalms 92:2
.
With the ten-stringed lute and with the harp, With resounding music upon the lyre. -- psalms 92:3
.
For You, O LORD, have made me glad by what You have done, I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands. -- psalms 92:4
.
How great are Your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep. -- psalms 92:5
.
A senseless man has no knowledge, Nor does a stupid man understand this: -- psalms 92:6
.
That when the wicked sprouted up like grass And all who did iniquity flourished, It was only that they might be destroyed forevermore. -- psalms 92:7
.
But You, O LORD, are on high forever. -- psalms 92:8
.
For, behold, Your enemies, O LORD, For, behold, Your enemies will perish; All who do iniquity will be scattered. -- psalms 92:9
.
But You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil. -- psalms 92:10
.
And my eye has looked exultantly upon my foes, My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me. -- psalms 92:11
.
The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. -- psalms 92:12
.
Planted in the house of the LORD, They will flourish in the courts of our God. -- psalms 92:13
.
They will still yield fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and very green, -- psalms 92:14
.
To declare that the LORD is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him. -- psalms 92:15
.
The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The LORD has clothed and girded Himself with strength; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved. -- psalms 93:1
.
Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting. -- psalms 93:2
.
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice, The floods lift up their pounding waves. -- psalms 93:3
.
More than the sounds of many waters, Than the mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty. -- psalms 93:4
.
Your testimonies are fully confirmed; Holiness befits Your house, O LORD, forevermore. -- psalms 93:5
.
O LORD, God of vengeance, God of vengeance, shine forth! -- psalms 94:1
.
Rise up, O Judge of the earth, Render recompense to the proud. -- psalms 94:2
.
How long shall the wicked, O LORD, How long shall the wicked exult? -- psalms 94:3
.
They pour forth words, they speak arrogantly; All who do wickedness vaunt themselves. -- psalms 94:4
.
They crush Your people, O LORD, And afflict Your heritage. -- psalms 94:5
.
They slay the widow and the stranger And murder the orphans. -- psalms 94:6
.
They have said, "The LORD does not see, Nor does the God of Jacob pay heed." -- psalms 94:7
.
Pay heed, you senseless among the people; And when will you understand, stupid ones? -- psalms 94:8
.
He who planted the ear, does He not hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see? -- psalms 94:9
.
He who chastens the nations, will He not rebuke, Even He who teaches man knowledge? -- psalms 94:10
.
The LORD knows the thoughts of man, That they are a mere breath. -- psalms 94:11
.
Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O LORD, And whom You teach out of Your law; -- psalms 94:12
.
That You may grant him relief from the days of adversity, Until a pit is dug for the wicked. -- psalms 94:13
.
For the LORD will not abandon His people, Nor will He forsake His inheritance. -- psalms 94:14
.
For judgment will again be righteous, And all the upright in heart will follow it. -- psalms 94:15
.
Who will stand up for me against evildoers? Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness? -- psalms 94:16
.
If the LORD had not been my help, My soul would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence. -- psalms 94:17
.
If I should say, "My foot has slipped," Your lovingkindness, O LORD, will hold me up. -- psalms 94:18
.
When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations delight my soul. -- psalms 94:19
.
Can a throne of destruction be allied with You, One which devises mischief by decree? -- psalms 94:20
.
They band themselves together against the life of the righteous And condemn the innocent to death. -- psalms 94:21
.
But the LORD has been my stronghold, And my God the rock of my refuge. -- psalms 94:22
.
He has brought back their wickedness upon them And will destroy them in their evil; The LORD our God will destroy them. -- psalms 94:23
.
O come, let us sing for joy to the LORD, Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation. -- psalms 95:1
.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms. -- psalms 95:2
.
For the LORD is a great God And a great King above all gods, -- psalms 95:3
.
In whose hand are the depths of the earth, The peaks of the mountains are His also. -- psalms 95:4
.
The sea is His, for it was He who made it, And His hands formed the dry land. -- psalms 95:5
.
Come, let us worship and bow down, Let us kneel before the LORD our Maker. -- psalms 95:6
.
For He is our God, And we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you would hear His voice, -- psalms 95:7
.
Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness, -- psalms 95:8
.
"When your fathers tested Me, They tried Me, though they had seen My work. -- psalms 95:9
.
"For forty years I loathed that generation, And said they are a people who err in their heart, And they do not know My ways. -- psalms 95:10
.
"Therefore I swore in My anger, Truly they shall not enter into My rest." -- psalms 95:11
.
Sing to the LORD a new song; Sing to the LORD, all the earth. -- psalms 96:1
.
Sing to the LORD, bless His name; Proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day. -- psalms 96:2
.
Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples. -- psalms 96:3
.
For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. -- psalms 96:4
.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens. -- psalms 96:5
.
Splendor and majesty are before Him, Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. -- psalms 96:6
.

.
For the LORD has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory. -- psalms 102:16
.
He has regarded the prayer of the destitute And has not despised their prayer. -- psalms 102:17
.
This will be written for the generation to come, That a people yet to be created may praise the LORD. -- psalms 102:18
.
For He looked down from His holy height; From heaven the LORD gazed upon the earth, -- psalms 102:19
.
To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To set free those who were doomed to death, -- psalms 102:20
.
That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion And His praise in Jerusalem, -- psalms 102:21
.
When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. -- psalms 102:22
.

.
"Of old You founded the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. -- psalms 102:25

Who pardons all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases; -- psalms 103:3
.
Who redeems your life from the pit, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion; -- psalms 103:4
.
Who satisfies your years with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle. -- psalms 103:5
.
The LORD performs righteous deeds And judgments for all who are oppressed. -- psalms 103:6
.
He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel. -- psalms 103:7
.
The LORD is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness. -- psalms 103:8
.
He will not always strive with us, Nor will He keep His anger forever. -- psalms 103:9
.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. -- psalms 103:10
.
For as high as the heavens are above the earth, So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him. -- psalms 103:11
.
As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us. -- psalms 103:12
.
Just as a father has compassion on his children, So the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him. -- psalms 103:13
.
For He Himself knows our frame; He is mindful that we are but dust. -- psalms 103:14
.
As for man, his days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes. -- psalms 103:15
.
When the wind has passed over it, it is no more, And its place acknowledges it no longer. -- psalms 103:16
.
But the lovingkindness of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children's children, -- psalms 103:17
.
To those who keep His covenant And remember His precepts to do them. -- psalms 103:18
.
The LORD has established His throne in the heavens, And His sovereignty rules over all. -- psalms 103:19
.
Bless the LORD, you His angels, Mighty in strength, who perform His word, Obeying the voice of His word! -- psalms 103:20
.
Bless the LORD, all you His hosts, You who serve Him, doing His will. -- psalms 103:21
.
Bless the LORD, all you works of His, In all places of His dominion; Bless the LORD, O my soul! -- psalms 103:22
.
Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty, -- psalms 104:1
.
Covering Yourself with light as with a cloak, Stretching out heaven like a tent curtain. -- psalms 104:2
.
He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He makes the clouds His chariot; He walks upon the wings of the wind; -- psalms 104:3
.
He makes the winds His messengers, Flaming fire His ministers. -- psalms 104:4
.
He established the earth upon its foundations, So that it will not totter forever and ever. -- psalms 104:5
.
You covered it with the deep as with a garment; The waters were standing above the mountains. -- psalms 104:6
.
At Your rebuke they fled, At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away. -- psalms 104:7
.
The mountains rose; the valleys sank down To the place which You established for them. -- psalms 104:8
.
You set a boundary that they may not pass over, So that they will not return to cover the earth. -- psalms 104:9
.
He sends forth springs in the valleys; They flow between the mountains; -- psalms 104:10
.
They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst. -- psalms 104:11
.
Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; They lift up their voices among the branches. -- psalms 104:12
.
He waters the mountains from His upper chambers; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works. -- psalms 104:13
.
He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, And vegetation for the labor of man, So that he may bring forth food from the earth, -- psalms 104:14
.
And wine which makes man's heart glad, So that he may make his face glisten with oil, And food which sustains man's heart. -- psalms 104:15
.
The trees of the LORD drink their fill, The cedars of Lebanon which He planted, -- psalms 104:16
.
Where the birds build their nests, And the stork, whose home is the fir trees. -- psalms 104:17
.
The high mountains are for the wild goats; The cliffs are a refuge for the shephanim. -- psalms 104:18
.
He made the moon for the seasons; The sun knows the place of its setting. -- psalms 104:19
.
You appoint darkness and it becomes night, In which all the beasts of the forest prowl about. -- psalms 104:20
.
The young lions roar after their prey And seek their food from God. -- psalms 104:21
.
When the sun rises they withdraw And lie down in their dens. -- psalms 104:22
.
Man goes forth to his work And to his labor until evening. -- psalms 104:23
.
O LORD, how many are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all; The earth is full of Your possessions. -- psalms 104:24
.
There is the sea, great and broad, In which are swarms without number, Animals both small and great. -- psalms 104:25
.
There the ships move along, And Leviathan, which You have formed to sport in it. -- psalms 104:26
.
They all wait for You To give them their food in due season. -- psalms 104:27
.
You give to them, they gather it up; You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good. -- psalms 104:28
.
You hide Your face, they are dismayed; You take away their spirit, they expire And return to their dust. -- psalms 104:29
.
You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew the face of the ground. -- psalms 104:30
.
Let the glory of the LORD endure forever; Let the LORD be glad in His works; -- psalms 104:31
.
He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke. -- psalms 104:32
.
I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. -- psalms 104:33
.
Let my meditation be pleasing to Him; As for me, I shall be glad in the LORD. -- psalms 104:34
.
Let sinners be consumed from the earth And let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD! -- psalms 104:35
.
Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples. -- psalms 105:1
.
Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; Speak of all His wonders. -- psalms 105:2
.
Glory in His holy name; Let the heart of those who seek the LORD be glad. -- psalms 105:3
.
Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually. -- psalms 105:4
.
Remember His wonders which He has done, His marvels and the judgments uttered by His mouth, -- psalms 105:5
.
O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones! -- psalms 105:6
.
He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth. -- psalms 105:7
.
He has remembered His covenant forever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations, -- psalms 105:8
.
The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac. -- psalms 105:9
.
Then He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant, -- psalms 105:10
.
Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan As the portion of your inheritance," -- psalms 105:11
.
When they were only a few men in number, Very few, and strangers in it. -- psalms 105:12
.
And they wandered about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people. -- psalms 105:13
.
He permitted no man to oppress them, And He reproved kings for their sakes: -- psalms 105:14
.
"Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm." -- psalms 105:15
.
And He called for a famine upon the land; He broke the whole staff of bread. -- psalms 105:16
.
He sent a man before them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. -- psalms 105:17
.
They afflicted his feet with fetters, He himself was laid in irons; -- psalms 105:18
.
Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the LORD tested him. -- psalms 105:19
.
The king sent and released him, The ruler of peoples, and set him free. -- psalms 105:20
.
He made him lord of his house And ruler over all his possessions, -- psalms 105:21
.
To imprison his princes at will, That he might teach his elders wisdom. -- psalms 105:22
.
Israel also came into Egypt; Thus Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. -- psalms 105:23
.
And He caused His people to be very fruitful, And made them stronger than their adversaries. -- psalms 105:24
.
He turned their heart to hate His people, To deal craftily with His servants. -- psalms 105:25
.
He sent Moses His servant, And Aaron, whom He had chosen. -- psalms 105:26
.
They performed His wondrous acts among them, And miracles in the land of Ham. -- psalms 105:27
.
He sent darkness and made it dark; And they did not rebel against His words. -- psalms 105:28
.
He turned their waters into blood And caused their fish to die. -- psalms 105:29
.
Their land swarmed with frogs Even in the chambers of their kings. -- psalms 105:30
.
He spoke, and there came a swarm of flies And gnats in all their territory. -- psalms 105:31
.
He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land. -- psalms 105:32
.
He struck down their vines also and their fig trees, And shattered the trees of their territory. -- psalms 105:33
.
He spoke, and locusts came, And young locusts, even without number, -- psalms 105:34
.
And ate up all vegetation in their land, And ate up the fruit of their ground. -- psalms 105:35
.
He also struck down all the firstborn in their land, The first fruits of all their vigor. -- psalms 105:36
.
Then He brought them out with silver and gold, And among His tribes there was not one who stumbled. -- psalms 105:37
.
Egypt was glad when they departed, For the dread of them had fallen upon them. -- psalms 105:38
.
He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to illumine by night. -- psalms 105:39
.
They asked, and He brought quail, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. -- psalms 105:40
.
He opened the rock and water flowed out; It ran in the dry places like a river. -- psalms 105:41
.
For He remembered His holy word With Abraham His servant; -- psalms 105:42
.
And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with a joyful shout. -- psalms 105:43
.
He gave them also the lands of the nations, That they might take possession of the fruit of the peoples' labor, -- psalms 105:44
.
So that they might keep His statutes And observe His laws, Praise the LORD! -- psalms 105:45
.
Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting. -- psalms 106:1
.
Who can speak of the mighty deeds of the LORD, Or can show forth all His praise? -- psalms 106:2
.
How blessed are those who keep justice, Who practice righteousness at all times! -- psalms 106:3
.
Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor toward Your people; Visit me with Your salvation, -- psalms 106:4
.
That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, That I may glory with Your inheritance. -- psalms 106:5
.
We have sinned like our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have behaved wickedly. -- psalms 106:6
.
Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; They did not remember Your abundant kindnesses, But rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea. -- psalms 106:7
.
Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name, That He might make His power known. -- psalms 106:8
.
Thus He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up, And He led them through the deeps, as through the wilderness. -- psalms 106:9
.
So He saved them from the hand of the one who hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. -- psalms 106:10
.
The waters covered their adversaries; Not one of them was left. -- psalms 106:11
.
Then they believed His words; They sang His praise. -- psalms 106:12
.
They quickly forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel, -- psalms 106:13
.
But craved intensely in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert. -- psalms 106:14
.
So He gave them their request, But sent a wasting disease among them. -- psalms 106:15
.
When they became envious of Moses in the camp, And of Aaron, the holy one of the LORD, -- psalms 106:16
.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And engulfed the company of Abiram. -- psalms 106:17
.
And a fire blazed up in their company; The flame consumed the wicked. -- psalms 106:18
.
They made a calf in Horeb And worshiped a molten image. -- psalms 106:19
.
Thus they exchanged their glory For the image of an ox that eats grass. -- psalms 106:20
.
They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt, -- psalms 106:21
.
Wonders in the land of Ham And awesome things by the Red Sea. -- psalms 106:22
.
Therefore He said that He would destroy them, Had not Moses His chosen one stood in the breach before Him, To turn away His wrath from destroying them. -- psalms 106:23
.
Then they despised the pleasant land; They did not believe in His word, -- psalms 106:24
.
But grumbled in their tents; They did not listen to the voice of the LORD. -- psalms 106:25
.
Therefore He swore to them That He would cast them down in the wilderness, -- psalms 106:26
.
And that He would cast their seed among the nations And scatter them in the lands. -- psalms 106:27
.
They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, And ate sacrifices offered to the dead. -- psalms 106:28
.
Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them. -- psalms 106:29
.
Then Phinehas stood up and interposed, And so the plague was stayed. -- psalms 106:30
.
And it was reckoned to him for righteousness, To all generations forever. -- psalms 106:31
.
They also provoked Him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, So that it went hard with Moses on their account; -- psalms 106:32
.
Because they were rebellious against His Spirit, He spoke rashly with his lips. -- psalms 106:33
.
They did not destroy the peoples, As the LORD commanded them, -- psalms 106:34
.
But they mingled with the nations And learned their practices, -- psalms 106:35
.
And served their idols, Which became a snare to them. -- psalms 106:36
.
They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons, -- psalms 106:37
.
And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with the blood. -- psalms 106:38
.
Thus they became unclean in their practices, And played the harlot in their deeds. -- psalms 106:39
.
Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people And He abhorred His inheritance. -- psalms 106:40
.
Then He gave them into the hand of the nations, And those who hated them ruled over them. -- psalms 106:41
.
Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were subdued under their power. -- psalms 106:42
.
Many times He would deliver them; They, however, were rebellious in their counsel, And so sank down in their iniquity. -- psalms 106:43
.
Nevertheless He looked upon their distress When He heard their cry; -- psalms 106:44
.
And He remembered His covenant for their sake, And relented according to the greatness of His lovingkindness. -- psalms 106:45
.
He also made them objects of compassion In the presence of all their captors. -- psalms 106:46
.
Save us, O LORD our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to Your holy name And glory in Your praise. -- psalms 106:47
.
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, "Amen." Praise the LORD! -- psalms 106:48
.
Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good, For His lovingkindness is everlasting. -- psalms 107:1
.
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary -- psalms 107:2
.
And gathered from the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south. -- psalms 107:3
.
They wandered in the wilderness in a desert region; They did not find a way to an inhabited city. -- psalms 107:4
.
They were hungry and thirsty; Their soul fainted within them. -- psalms 107:5
.
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He delivered them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:6
.
He led them also by a straight way, To go to an inhabited city. -- psalms 107:7
.
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men! -- psalms 107:8
.

.
He also loved cursing, so it came to him; And he did not delight in blessing, so it was far from him. -- psalms 109:17
.
But he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, And it entered into his body like water And like oil into his bones. -- psalms 109:18

.
The eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it. -- proverbs 30:17
.
There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Four which I do not understand: -- proverbs 30:18
.
The way of an eagle in the sky, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the middle of the sea, And the way of a man with a maid. -- proverbs 30:19
.
This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, "I have done no wrong." -- proverbs 30:20
.
Under three things the earth quakes, And under four, it cannot bear up: -- proverbs 30:21
.
Under a slave when he becomes king, And a fool when he is satisfied with food, -- proverbs 30:22
.
Under an unloved woman when she gets a husband, And a maidservant when she supplants her mistress. -- proverbs 30:23

The words of King Lemuel, the oracle which his mother taught him: -- proverbs 31:1
.
What, O my son? And what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows? -- proverbs 31:2
.
Do not give your strength to women, Or your ways to that which destroys kings. -- proverbs 31:3
.
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Or for rulers to desire strong drink, -- proverbs 31:4

For they will drink and forget what is decreed, And pervert the rights of all the afflicted. -- proverbs 31:5

.
She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in delight. -- proverbs 31:13
.
She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar. -- proverbs 31:14
.
She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her household And portions to her maidens. -- proverbs 31:15
.
She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she plants a vineyard. -- proverbs 31:16
.
She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong. -- proverbs 31:17
.
She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night. -- proverbs 31:18
.
She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands grasp the spindle. -- proverbs 31:19

.
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 1:1
.
"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher, "Vanity of vanities! All is vanity." -- ecclesiastes 1:2
.
What advantage does man have in all his work Which he does under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 1:3
.
A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth remains forever. -- ecclesiastes 1:4
.
Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there again. -- ecclesiastes 1:5
.
Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns. -- ecclesiastes 1:6
.
All the rivers flow into the sea, Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, There they flow again. -- ecclesiastes 1:7
.
All things are wearisome; Man is not able to tell it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor is the ear filled with hearing. -- ecclesiastes 1:8
.
That which has been is that which will be, And that which has been done is that which will be done. So there is nothing new under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 1:9
.
Is there anything of which one might say, "See this, it is new"? Already it has existed for ages Which were before us. -- ecclesiastes 1:10
.
There is no remembrance of earlier things; And also of the later things which will occur, There will be for them no remembrance Among those who will come later still. -- ecclesiastes 1:11
.
I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 1:12
.
And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. -- ecclesiastes 1:13
.
I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 1:14
.
What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted. -- ecclesiastes 1:15
.
I said to myself, "Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge." -- ecclesiastes 1:16
.
And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 1:17
.
Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain. -- ecclesiastes 1:18
.
I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself." And behold, it too was futility. -- ecclesiastes 2:1
.
I said of laughter, "It is madness," and of pleasure, "What does it accomplish?" -- ecclesiastes 2:2
.
I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely, and how to take hold of folly, until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives. -- ecclesiastes 2:3
.
I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself; -- ecclesiastes 2:4
.
I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees; -- ecclesiastes 2:5
.
I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees. -- ecclesiastes 2:6
.
I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 2:7
.
Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men--many concubines. -- ecclesiastes 2:8
.
Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me. -- ecclesiastes 2:9
.
All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor. -- ecclesiastes 2:10
.
Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:11
.
So I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly; for what will the man do who will come after the king except what has already been done? -- ecclesiastes 2:12
.
And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness. -- ecclesiastes 2:13
.
The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both. -- ecclesiastes 2:14
.
Then I said to myself, "As is the fate of the fool, it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?" So I said to myself, "This too is vanity." -- ecclesiastes 2:15
.
For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man as with the fool, inasmuch as in the coming days all will be forgotten. And how the wise man and the fool alike die! -- ecclesiastes 2:16
.
So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 2:17
.
Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me. -- ecclesiastes 2:18
.
And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:19
.
Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:20
.
When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity and a great evil. -- ecclesiastes 2:21
.
For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 2:22
.
Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:23
.
There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God. -- ecclesiastes 2:24
.
For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him? -- ecclesiastes 2:25
.
For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God's sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 2:26
.
There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven-- -- ecclesiastes 3:1
.
A time to give birth and a time to die; A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted. -- ecclesiastes 3:2
.
A time to kill and a time to heal; A time to tear down and a time to build up. -- ecclesiastes 3:3
.
A time to weep and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance. -- ecclesiastes 3:4
.
A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing. -- ecclesiastes 3:5
.
A time to search and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away. -- ecclesiastes 3:6
.
A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to speak. -- ecclesiastes 3:7
.
A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace. -- ecclesiastes 3:8
.
What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils? -- ecclesiastes 3:9
.
I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves. -- ecclesiastes 3:10
.
He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end. -- ecclesiastes 3:11
.
I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one's lifetime; -- ecclesiastes 3:12
.
moreover, that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor--it is the gift of God. -- ecclesiastes 3:13
.
I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has so worked that men should fear Him. -- ecclesiastes 3:14
.
That which is has been already and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by. -- ecclesiastes 3:15
.
Furthermore, I have seen under the sun that in the place of justice there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness. -- ecclesiastes 3:16
.
I said to myself, "God will judge both the righteous man and the wicked man," for a time for every matter and for every deed is there. -- ecclesiastes 3:17
.
I said to myself concerning the sons of men, "God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts." -- ecclesiastes 3:18
.
For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 3:19
.
All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. -- ecclesiastes 3:20
.
Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth? -- ecclesiastes 3:21
.
I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him? -- ecclesiastes 3:22
.
Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold I saw the tears of the oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them. -- ecclesiastes 4:1
.
So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living. -- ecclesiastes 4:2
.
But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 4:3
.
I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbor. This too is vanity and striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 4:4
.
The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh. -- ecclesiastes 4:5
.
One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 4:6
.
Then I looked again at vanity under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 4:7
.
There was a certain man without a dependent, having neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked, "And for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure?" This too is vanity and it is a grievous task. -- ecclesiastes 4:8
.
Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor. -- ecclesiastes 4:9
.
For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up. -- ecclesiastes 4:10
.
Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone? -- ecclesiastes 4:11
.
And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart. -- ecclesiastes 4:12
.
A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive instruction. -- ecclesiastes 4:13
.
For he has come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom. -- ecclesiastes 4:14
.
I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him. -- ecclesiastes 4:15
.
There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them, and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him, for this too is vanity and striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 4:16
.
Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil. -- ecclesiastes 5:1
.
Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few. -- ecclesiastes 5:2
.
For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words. -- ecclesiastes 5:3
.
When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow! -- ecclesiastes 5:4
.
It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. -- ecclesiastes 5:5
.
Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands? -- ecclesiastes 5:6
.
For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God. -- ecclesiastes 5:7
.
If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight; for one official watches over another official, and there are higher officials over them. -- ecclesiastes 5:8
.
After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land. -- ecclesiastes 5:9
.
He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance with its income. This too is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 5:10
.
When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on? -- ecclesiastes 5:11
.
The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep. -- ecclesiastes 5:12
.
There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt. -- ecclesiastes 5:13
.
When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing to support him. -- ecclesiastes 5:14
.
As he had come naked from his mother's womb, so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand. -- ecclesiastes 5:15
.
This also is a grievous evil--exactly as a man is born, thus will he die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind? -- ecclesiastes 5:16
.
Throughout his life he also eats in darkness with great vexation, sickness and anger. -- ecclesiastes 5:17
.
Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat, to drink and enjoy oneself in all one's labor in which he toils under the sun during the few years of his life which God has given him; for this is his reward. -- ecclesiastes 5:18
.
Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God. -- ecclesiastes 5:19
.
For he will not often consider the years of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart. -- ecclesiastes 5:20
.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men-- -- ecclesiastes 6:1
.
a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction. -- ecclesiastes 6:2
.
If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a proper burial, then I say, "Better the miscarriage than he, -- ecclesiastes 6:3
.
for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity. -- ecclesiastes 6:4
.
"It never sees the sun and it never knows anything; it is better off than he. -- ecclesiastes 6:5
.
"Even if the other man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things--do not all go to one place?" -- ecclesiastes 6:6
.
All a man's labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied. -- ecclesiastes 6:7
.
For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What advantage does the poor man have, knowing how to walk before the living? -- ecclesiastes 6:8
.
What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind. -- ecclesiastes 6:9
.
Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is. -- ecclesiastes 6:10
.
For there are many words which increase futility. What then is the advantage to a man? -- ecclesiastes 6:11
.
For who knows what is good for a man during his lifetime, during the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 6:12
.
A good name is better than a good ointment, And the day of one's death is better than the day of one's birth. -- ecclesiastes 7:1
.
It is better to go to a house of mourning Than to go to a house of feasting, Because that is the end of every man, And the living takes it to heart. -- ecclesiastes 7:2
.
Sorrow is better than laughter, For when a face is sad a heart may be happy. -- ecclesiastes 7:3
.
The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning, While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure. -- ecclesiastes 7:4
.
It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man Than for one to listen to the song of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:5
.
For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool; And this too is futility. -- ecclesiastes 7:6
.
For oppression makes a wise man mad, And a bribe corrupts the heart. -- ecclesiastes 7:7
.
The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 7:8
.
Do not be eager in your heart to be angry, For anger resides in the bosom of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:9
.
Do not say, "Why is it that the former days were better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this. -- ecclesiastes 7:10
.
Wisdom along with an inheritance is good And an advantage to those who see the sun. -- ecclesiastes 7:11
.
For wisdom is protection just as money is protection, But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors. -- ecclesiastes 7:12
.
Consider the work of God, For who is able to straighten what He has bent? -- ecclesiastes 7:13
.
In the day of prosperity be happy, But in the day of adversity consider-- God has made the one as well as the other So that man will not discover anything that will be after him. -- ecclesiastes 7:14
.
I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness. -- ecclesiastes 7:15
.
Do not be excessively righteous and do not be overly wise. Why should you ruin yourself? -- ecclesiastes 7:16
.
Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time? -- ecclesiastes 7:17
.
It is good that you grasp one thing and also not let go of the other; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them. -- ecclesiastes 7:18
.
Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city. -- ecclesiastes 7:19
.
Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins. -- ecclesiastes 7:20
.
Also, do not take seriously all words which are spoken, so that you will not hear your servant cursing you. -- ecclesiastes 7:21
.
For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others. -- ecclesiastes 7:22
.
I tested all this with wisdom, and I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me. -- ecclesiastes 7:23
.
What has been is remote and exceedingly mysterious. Who can discover it? -- ecclesiastes 7:24
.
I directed my mind to know, to investigate and to seek wisdom and an explanation, and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of madness. -- ecclesiastes 7:25
.
And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her. -- ecclesiastes 7:26
.
"Behold, I have discovered this," says the Preacher, "adding one thing to another to find an explanation, -- ecclesiastes 7:27
.
which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these. -- ecclesiastes 7:28
.
"Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many devices." -- ecclesiastes 7:29
.
Who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom illumines him and causes his stern face to beam. -- ecclesiastes 8:1
.
I say, "Keep the command of the king because of the oath before God. -- ecclesiastes 8:2
.
"Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases." -- ecclesiastes 8:3
.
Since the word of the king is authoritative, who will say to him, "What are you doing?" -- ecclesiastes 8:4
.
He who keeps a royal command experiences no trouble, for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure. -- ecclesiastes 8:5
.
For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight, though a man's trouble is heavy upon him. -- ecclesiastes 8:6
.
If no one knows what will happen, who can tell him when it will happen? -- ecclesiastes 8:7
.
No man has authority to restrain the wind with the wind, or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the time of war, and evil will not deliver those who practice it. -- ecclesiastes 8:8
.
All this I have seen and applied my mind to every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised authority over another man to his hurt. -- ecclesiastes 8:9
.
So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who used to go in and out from the holy place, and they are soon forgotten in the city where they did thus. This too is futility. -- ecclesiastes 8:10
.
Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully to do evil. -- ecclesiastes 8:11
.
Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and may lengthen his life, still I know that it will be well for those who fear God, who fear Him openly. -- ecclesiastes 8:12
.
But it will not be well for the evil man and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God. -- ecclesiastes 8:13
.
There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility. -- ecclesiastes 8:14
.
So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry, and this will stand by him in his toils throughout the days of his life which God has given him under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 8:15
.
When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never sleep day or night), -- ecclesiastes 8:16
.
and I saw every work of God, I concluded that man cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even though man should seek laboriously, he will not discover; and though the wise man should say, "I know," he cannot discover. -- ecclesiastes 8:17
.
For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it that righteous men, wise men, and their deeds are in the hand of God. Man does not know whether it will be love or hatred; anything awaits him. -- ecclesiastes 9:1
.
It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so is the one who is afraid to swear. -- ecclesiastes 9:2
.
This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men. Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterwards they go to the dead. -- ecclesiastes 9:3
.
For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion. -- ecclesiastes 9:4
.
For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory is forgotten. -- ecclesiastes 9:5
.
Indeed their love, their hate and their zeal have already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:6
.
Go then, eat your bread in happiness and drink your wine with a cheerful heart; for God has already approved your works. -- ecclesiastes 9:7
.
Let your clothes be white all the time, and let not oil be lacking on your head. -- ecclesiastes 9:8
.
Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:9
.
Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going. -- ecclesiastes 9:10
.
I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all. -- ecclesiastes 9:11
.
Moreover, man does not know his time: like fish caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare, so the sons of men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them. -- ecclesiastes 9:12
.
Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me. -- ecclesiastes 9:13
.
There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it, surrounded it and constructed large siegeworks against it. -- ecclesiastes 9:14
.
But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man. -- ecclesiastes 9:15
.
So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded. -- ecclesiastes 9:16
.
The words of the wise heard in quietness are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools. -- ecclesiastes 9:17
.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good. -- ecclesiastes 9:18
.
Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom and honor. -- ecclesiastes 10:1
.
A wise man's heart directs him toward the right, but the foolish man's heart directs him toward the left. -- ecclesiastes 10:2
.
Even when the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking and he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool. -- ecclesiastes 10:3
.
If the ruler's temper rises against you, do not abandon your position, because composure allays great offenses. -- ecclesiastes 10:4
.
There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which goes forth from the ruler-- -- ecclesiastes 10:5
.
folly is set in many exalted places while rich men sit in humble places. -- ecclesiastes 10:6
.
