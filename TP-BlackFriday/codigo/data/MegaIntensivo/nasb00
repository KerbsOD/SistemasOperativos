In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. -- genesis 1:1
.
The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. -- genesis 1:2
.
Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. -- genesis 1:3
.
God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. -- genesis 1:4
.
God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. -- genesis 1:5
.
Then God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." -- genesis 1:6
.
God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. -- genesis 1:7
.
God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. -- genesis 1:8
.
Then God said, "Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so. -- genesis 1:9
.
God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good. -- genesis 1:10
.
Then God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them"; and it was so. -- genesis 1:11
.
The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. -- genesis 1:12
.
There was evening and there was morning, a third day. -- genesis 1:13
.
Then God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; -- genesis 1:14
.
and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth"; and it was so. -- genesis 1:15
.
God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also. -- genesis 1:16
.
God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, -- genesis 1:17
.
and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. -- genesis 1:18
.
There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. -- genesis 1:19
.
Then God said, "Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens." -- genesis 1:20
.
God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good. -- genesis 1:21
.
God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth." -- genesis 1:22
.
There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. -- genesis 1:23
.
Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind"; and it was so. -- genesis 1:24
.
God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good. -- genesis 1:25
.
Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." -- genesis 1:26
.
God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. -- genesis 1:27
.
God blessed them; and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth." -- genesis 1:28
.
Then God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; -- genesis 1:29
.
and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every green plant for food"; and it was so. -- genesis 1:30
.
God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. -- genesis 1:31
.
Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. -- genesis 2:1
.
By the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. -- genesis 2:2
.
Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made. -- genesis 2:3
.
This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven. -- genesis 2:4
.
Now no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground. -- genesis 2:5
.
But a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground. -- genesis 2:6
.
Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. -- genesis 2:7
.
The LORD God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden; and there He placed the man whom He had formed. -- genesis 2:8
.
Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. -- genesis 2:9
.
Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers. -- genesis 2:10
.
The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. -- genesis 2:11
.
The gold of that land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there. -- genesis 2:12
.
The name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the whole land of Cush. -- genesis 2:13
.
The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. -- genesis 2:14
.
Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. -- genesis 2:15
.
The LORD God commanded the man, saying, "From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; -- genesis 2:16
.
but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die." -- genesis 2:17
.
Then the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him." -- genesis 2:18
.
Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name. -- genesis 2:19
.
The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him. -- genesis 2:20
.
So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. -- genesis 2:21
.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. -- genesis 2:22
.
The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man." -- genesis 2:23
.
For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. -- genesis 2:24
.
And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed. -- genesis 2:25
.
Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?" -- genesis 3:1
.
The woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; -- genesis 3:2
.
but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.'" -- genesis 3:3
.
The serpent said to the woman, "You surely will not die! -- genesis 3:4
.
"For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." -- genesis 3:5
.
When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate. -- genesis 3:6
.
Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings. -- genesis 3:7
.
They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. -- genesis 3:8
.
Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?" -- genesis 3:9
.
He said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself." -- genesis 3:10
.
And He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?" -- genesis 3:11
.
The man said, "The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate." -- genesis 3:12
.
Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate." -- genesis 3:13
.
The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your life; -- genesis 3:14
.
And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel." -- genesis 3:15
.
To the woman He said, "I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you." -- genesis 3:16
.
Then to Adam He said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you will eat of it All the days of your life. -- genesis 3:17
.
"Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field; -- genesis 3:18
.
By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall return." -- genesis 3:19
.
Now the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all the living. -- genesis 3:20
.
The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them. -- genesis 3:21
.
Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"-- -- genesis 3:22
.
therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken. -- genesis 3:23
.
So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life. -- genesis 3:24
.
Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, "I have gotten a manchild with the help of the LORD." -- genesis 4:1
.
Again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. -- genesis 4:2
.
So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground. -- genesis 4:3
.
Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; -- genesis 4:4
.
but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell. -- genesis 4:5
.
Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? -- genesis 4:6
.
"If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it." -- genesis 4:7
.
Cain told Abel his brother. And it came about when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. -- genesis 4:8
.
Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?" -- genesis 4:9
.
He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground. -- genesis 4:10
.
"Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. -- genesis 4:11
.
"When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth." -- genesis 4:12
.
Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is too great to bear! -- genesis 4:13
.
"Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Your face I will be hidden, and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me." -- genesis 4:14
.
So the LORD said to him, "Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, so that no one finding him would slay him. -- genesis 4:15
.
Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. -- genesis 4:16
.
Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city Enoch, after the name of his son. -- genesis 4:17
.
Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael became the father of Methushael, and Methushael became the father of Lamech. -- genesis 4:18
.
Lamech took to himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah. -- genesis 4:19
.
Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. -- genesis 4:20
.
His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. -- genesis 4:21
.
As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. -- genesis 4:22
.
Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, Listen to my voice, You wives of Lamech, Give heed to my speech, For I have killed a man for wounding me; And a boy for striking me; -- genesis 4:23
.
If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold." -- genesis 4:24
.
Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for, she said, "God has appointed me another offspring in place of Abel, for Cain killed him." -- genesis 4:25
.
To Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD. -- genesis 4:26
.
This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God. -- genesis 5:1
.
He created them male and female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were created. -- genesis 5:2
.
When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth. -- genesis 5:3
.
Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:4
.
So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died. -- genesis 5:5
.
Seth lived one hundred and five years, and became the father of Enosh. -- genesis 5:6
.
Then Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after he became the father of Enosh, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:7
.
So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. -- genesis 5:8
.
Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan. -- genesis 5:9
.
Then Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he became the father of Kenan, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:10
.
So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died. -- genesis 5:11
.
Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel. -- genesis 5:12
.
Then Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years after he became the father of Mahalalel, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:13
.
So all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died. -- genesis 5:14
.
Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared. -- genesis 5:15
.
Then Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Jared, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:16
.
So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died. -- genesis 5:17
.
Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch. -- genesis 5:18
.
Then Jared lived eight hundred years after he became the father of Enoch, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:19
.
So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died. -- genesis 5:20
.
Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah. -- genesis 5:21
.
Then Enoch walked with God three hundred years after he became the father of Methuselah, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:22
.
So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. -- genesis 5:23
.
Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him. -- genesis 5:24
.
Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech. -- genesis 5:25
.
Then Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after he became the father of Lamech, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:26
.
So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died. -- genesis 5:27
.
Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of a son. -- genesis 5:28
.
Now he called his name Noah, saying, "This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands arising from the ground which the LORD has cursed." -- genesis 5:29
.
Then Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years after he became the father of Noah, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 5:30
.
So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died. -- genesis 5:31
.
Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. -- genesis 5:32
.
Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, -- genesis 6:1
.
that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. -- genesis 6:2
.
Then the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years." -- genesis 6:3
.
The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. -- genesis 6:4
.
Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. -- genesis 6:5
.
The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. -- genesis 6:6
.
The LORD said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them." -- genesis 6:7
.
But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. -- genesis 6:8
.
These are the records of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God. -- genesis 6:9
.
Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. -- genesis 6:10
.
Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was filled with violence. -- genesis 6:11
.
God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. -- genesis 6:12
.
Then God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth. -- genesis 6:13
.
"Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch. -- genesis 6:14
.
"This is how you shall make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. -- genesis 6:15
.
"You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top; and set the door of the ark in the side of it; you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks. -- genesis 6:16
.
"Behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish. -- genesis 6:17
.
"But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark--you and your sons and your wife, and your sons' wives with you. -- genesis 6:18
.
"And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. -- genesis 6:19
.
"Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every kind will come to you to keep them alive. -- genesis 6:20
.
"As for you, take for yourself some of all food which is edible, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be for food for you and for them." -- genesis 6:21
.
Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did. -- genesis 6:22
.
Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you alone I have seen to be righteous before Me in this time. -- genesis 7:1
.
"You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female; -- genesis 7:2
.
also of the birds of the sky, by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth. -- genesis 7:3
.
"For after seven more days, I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made." -- genesis 7:4
.
Noah did according to all that the LORD had commanded him. -- genesis 7:5
.
Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of water came upon the earth. -- genesis 7:6
.
Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood. -- genesis 7:7
.
Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground, -- genesis 7:8
.
there went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. -- genesis 7:9
.
It came about after the seven days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth. -- genesis 7:10
.
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of the sky were opened. -- genesis 7:11
.
The rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. -- genesis 7:12
.
On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark, -- genesis 7:13
.
they and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, all sorts of birds. -- genesis 7:14
.
So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life. -- genesis 7:15
.
Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed it behind him. -- genesis 7:16
.
Then the flood came upon the earth for forty days, and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth. -- genesis 7:17
.
The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. -- genesis 7:18
.
The water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered. -- genesis 7:19
.
The water prevailed fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered. -- genesis 7:20
.
All flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; -- genesis 7:21
.
of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. -- genesis 7:22
.
Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth; and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark. -- genesis 7:23
.
The water prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days. -- genesis 7:24
.
But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided. -- genesis 8:1
.
Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained; -- genesis 8:2
.
and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of one hundred and fifty days the water decreased. -- genesis 8:3
.
In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat. -- genesis 8:4
.
The water decreased steadily until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible. -- genesis 8:5
.
Then it came about at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made; -- genesis 8:6
.
and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth. -- genesis 8:7
.
Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the water was abated from the face of the land; -- genesis 8:8
.
but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him into the ark, for the water was on the surface of all the earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and brought her into the ark to himself. -- genesis 8:9
.
So he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark. -- genesis 8:10
.
The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth. -- genesis 8:11
.
Then he waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; but she did not return to him again. -- genesis 8:12
.
Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the water was dried up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dried up. -- genesis 8:13
.
In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. -- genesis 8:14
.
Then God spoke to Noah, saying, -- genesis 8:15
.
"Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you. -- genesis 8:16
.
"Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth." -- genesis 8:17
.
So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him. -- genesis 8:18
.
Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark. -- genesis 8:19
.
Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. -- genesis 8:20
.
The LORD smelled the soothing aroma; and the LORD said to Himself, "I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the intent of man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done. -- genesis 8:21
.
"While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, And cold and heat, And summer and winter, And day and night Shall not cease." -- genesis 8:22
.
And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. -- genesis 9:1
.
"The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given. -- genesis 9:2
.
"Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as I gave the green plant. -- genesis 9:3
.
"Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. -- genesis 9:4
.
"Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from every man, from every man's brother I will require the life of man. -- genesis 9:5
.
"Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man. -- genesis 9:6
.
"As for you, be fruitful and multiply; Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it." -- genesis 9:7
.
Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, -- genesis 9:8
.
"Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you; -- genesis 9:9
.
and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. -- genesis 9:10
.
"I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth." -- genesis 9:11
.
God said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all successive generations; -- genesis 9:12
.
I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. -- genesis 9:13
.
"It shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow will be seen in the cloud, -- genesis 9:14
.
and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. -- genesis 9:15
.
"When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth." -- genesis 9:16
.
And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth." -- genesis 9:17
.
Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan. -- genesis 9:18
.
These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated. -- genesis 9:19
.
Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard. -- genesis 9:20
.
He drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent. -- genesis 9:21
.
Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. -- genesis 9:22
.
But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father's nakedness. -- genesis 9:23
.
When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. -- genesis 9:24
.
So he said, "Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers." -- genesis 9:25
.
He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant. -- genesis 9:26
.
"May God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant." -- genesis 9:27
.
Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. -- genesis 9:28
.
So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died. -- genesis 9:29
.
Now these are the records of the generations of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah; and sons were born to them after the flood. -- genesis 10:1
.
The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras. -- genesis 10:2
.
The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah. -- genesis 10:3
.
The sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim. -- genesis 10:4
.
From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. -- genesis 10:5
.
The sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan. -- genesis 10:6
.
The sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. -- genesis 10:7
.
Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth. -- genesis 10:8
.
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD." -- genesis 10:9
.
The beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. -- genesis 10:10
.
From that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and Calah, -- genesis 10:11
.
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. -- genesis 10:12
.
Mizraim became the father of Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim -- genesis 10:13
.
and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from which came the Philistines) and Caphtorim. -- genesis 10:14
.
Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth -- genesis 10:15
.
and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite -- genesis 10:16
.
and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite -- genesis 10:17
.
and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad. -- genesis 10:18
.
The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. -- genesis 10:19
.
These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, by their nations. -- genesis 10:20
.
Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, and the older brother of Japheth, children were born. -- genesis 10:21
.
The sons of Shem were Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram. -- genesis 10:22
.
The sons of Aram were Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash. -- genesis 10:23
.
Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber. -- genesis 10:24
.
Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. -- genesis 10:25
.
Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah -- genesis 10:26
.
and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah -- genesis 10:27
.
and Obal and Abimael and Sheba -- genesis 10:28
.
and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. -- genesis 10:29
.
Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east. -- genesis 10:30
.
These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations. -- genesis 10:31
.
These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood. -- genesis 10:32
.
Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words. -- genesis 11:1
.
It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. -- genesis 11:2
.
They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly." And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. -- genesis 11:3
.
They said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth." -- genesis 11:4
.
The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. -- genesis 11:5
.
The LORD said, "Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them. -- genesis 11:6
.
"Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another's speech." -- genesis 11:7
.
So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city. -- genesis 11:8
.
Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth. -- genesis 11:9
.
These are the records of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old, and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood; -- genesis 11:10
.
and Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:11
.
Arpachshad lived thirty-five years, and became the father of Shelah; -- genesis 11:12
.
and Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Shelah, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:13
.
Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber; -- genesis 11:14
.
and Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Eber, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:15
.
Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg; -- genesis 11:16
.
and Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:17
.
Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu; -- genesis 11:18
.
and Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he became the father of Reu, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:19
.
Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug; -- genesis 11:20
.
and Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he became the father of Serug, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:21
.
Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor; -- genesis 11:22
.
and Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:23
.
Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah; -- genesis 11:24
.
and Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and he had other sons and daughters. -- genesis 11:25
.
Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. -- genesis 11:26
.
Now these are the records of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran; and Haran became the father of Lot. -- genesis 11:27
.
Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. -- genesis 11:28
.
Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. -- genesis 11:29
.
Sarai was barren; she had no child. -- genesis 11:30
.
Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans in order to enter the land of Canaan; and they went as far as Haran, and settled there. -- genesis 11:31
.
The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran. -- genesis 11:32
.
Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will show you; -- genesis 12:1
.
And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; -- genesis 12:2
.
And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed." -- genesis 12:3
.
So Abram went forth as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. -- genesis 12:4
.
Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the persons which they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan; thus they came to the land of Canaan. -- genesis 12:5
.
Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanite was then in the land. -- genesis 12:6
.
The LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your descendants I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him. -- genesis 12:7
.
Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD. -- genesis 12:8
.
Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev. -- genesis 12:9
.
Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. -- genesis 12:10
.
It came about when he came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman; -- genesis 12:11
.
and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife'; and they will kill me, but they will let you live. -- genesis 12:12
.
"Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you." -- genesis 12:13
.
It came about when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. -- genesis 12:14
.
Pharaoh's officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. -- genesis 12:15
.
Therefore he treated Abram well for her sake; and gave him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male and female servants and female donkeys and camels. -- genesis 12:16
.
But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. -- genesis 12:17
.
Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? -- genesis 12:18
.
"Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her and go." -- genesis 12:19
.
Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they escorted him away, with his wife and all that belonged to him. -- genesis 12:20
.
So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, he and his wife and all that belonged to him, and Lot with him. -- genesis 13:1
.
Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold. -- genesis 13:2
.
He went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, -- genesis 13:3
.
to the place of the altar which he had made there formerly; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. -- genesis 13:4
.
Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. -- genesis 13:5
.
And the land could not sustain them while dwelling together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together. -- genesis 13:6
.
And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land. -- genesis 13:7
.
So Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers. -- genesis 13:8
.
"Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me; if to the left, then I will go to the right; or if to the right, then I will go to the left." -- genesis 13:9
.
Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere--this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah--like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you go to Zoar. -- genesis 13:10
.
So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward. Thus they separated from each other. -- genesis 13:11
.
Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the valley, and moved his tents as far as Sodom. -- genesis 13:12
.
Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly and sinners against the LORD. -- genesis 13:13
.
The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward; -- genesis 13:14
.
for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever. -- genesis 13:15
.
"I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants can also be numbered. -- genesis 13:16
.
"Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you." -- genesis 13:17
.
Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD. -- genesis 13:18
.
And it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, -- genesis 14:1
.
that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). -- genesis 14:2
.
All these came as allies to the valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). -- genesis 14:3
.
Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but the thirteenth year they rebelled. -- genesis 14:4
.
In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, -- genesis 14:5
.
and the Horites in their Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness. -- genesis 14:6
.
Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and conquered all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-tamar. -- genesis 14:7
.
And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) came out; and they arrayed for battle against them in the valley of Siddim, -- genesis 14:8
.
against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar--four kings against five. -- genesis 14:9
.
Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell into them. But those who survived fled to the hill country. -- genesis 14:10
.
Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply, and departed. -- genesis 14:11
.
They also took Lot, Abram's nephew, and his possessions and departed, for he was living in Sodom. -- genesis 14:12
.
Then a fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner, and these were allies with Abram. -- genesis 14:13
.
When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. -- genesis 14:14
.
He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus. -- genesis 14:15
.
He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions, and also the women, and the people. -- genesis 14:16
.
Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). -- genesis 14:17
.
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High. -- genesis 14:18
.
He blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; -- genesis 14:19
.
And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your enemies into your hand." He gave him a tenth of all. -- genesis 14:20
.
The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself." -- genesis 14:21
.
Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have sworn to the LORD God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth, -- genesis 14:22
.
that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours, for fear you would say, 'I have made Abram rich.' -- genesis 14:23
.
"I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share." -- genesis 14:24
.
After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great." -- genesis 15:1
.
Abram said, "O Lord GOD, what will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?" -- genesis 15:2
.
And Abram said, "Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir." -- genesis 15:3
.
Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir." -- genesis 15:4
.
And He took him outside and said, "Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." And He said to him, "So shall your descendants be." -- genesis 15:5
.
Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness. -- genesis 15:6
.
And He said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it." -- genesis 15:7
.
He said, "O Lord GOD, how may I know that I will possess it?" -- genesis 15:8
.
So He said to him, "Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon." -- genesis 15:9
.
Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. -- genesis 15:10
.
The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. -- genesis 15:11
.
Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him. -- genesis 15:12
.
God said to Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years. -- genesis 15:13
.
"But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions. -- genesis 15:14
.
"As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age. -- genesis 15:15
.
"Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete." -- genesis 15:16
.
It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces. -- genesis 15:17
.
On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates: -- genesis 15:18
.
the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite -- genesis 15:19
.
and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim -- genesis 15:20
.
and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite." -- genesis 15:21
.
Now Sarai, Abram's wife had borne him no children, and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar. -- genesis 16:1
.
So Sarai said to Abram, "Now behold, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will obtain children through her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. -- genesis 16:2
.
After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram's wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife. -- genesis 16:3
.
He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her sight. -- genesis 16:4
.
And Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the LORD judge between you and me." -- genesis 16:5
.
But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight." So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence. -- genesis 16:6
.
Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. -- genesis 16:7
.
He said, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come from and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai." -- genesis 16:8
.
Then the angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority." -- genesis 16:9
.
Moreover, the angel of the LORD said to her, "I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count." -- genesis 16:10
.
The angel of the LORD said to her further, "Behold, you are with child, And you will bear a son; And you shall call his name Ishmael, Because the LORD has given heed to your affliction. -- genesis 16:11
.
"He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be against everyone, And everyone's hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers." -- genesis 16:12
.
Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "You are a God who sees"; for she said, "Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?" -- genesis 16:13
.
Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. -- genesis 16:14
.
So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. -- genesis 16:15
.
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him. -- genesis 16:16
.
Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless. -- genesis 17:1
.
"I will establish My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly." -- genesis 17:2
.
Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, -- genesis 17:3
.
"As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations. -- genesis 17:4
.
"No longer shall your name be called Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. -- genesis 17:5
.
"I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you. -- genesis 17:6
.
"I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. -- genesis 17:7
.
"I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God." -- genesis 17:8
.
God said further to Abraham, "Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. -- genesis 17:9
.
"This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised. -- genesis 17:10
.
"And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you. -- genesis 17:11
.
"And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, a servant who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants. -- genesis 17:12
.
"A servant who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. -- genesis 17:13
.
"But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant." -- genesis 17:14
.
Then God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. -- genesis 17:15
.
"I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her." -- genesis 17:16
.
Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, "Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?" -- genesis 17:17
.
And Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before You!" -- genesis 17:18
.
But God said, "No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. -- genesis 17:19
.
"As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. -- genesis 17:20
.
"But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year." -- genesis 17:21
.
When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. -- genesis 17:22
.
Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all the servants who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as God had said to him. -- genesis 17:23
.
Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. -- genesis 17:24
.
And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. -- genesis 17:25
.
In the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son. -- genesis 17:26
.
All the men of his household, who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him. -- genesis 17:27
.
Now the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. -- genesis 18:1
.
When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth, -- genesis 18:2
.
and said, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by. -- genesis 18:3
.
"Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree; -- genesis 18:4
.
and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant." And they said, "So do, as you have said." -- genesis 18:5
.
So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it and make bread cakes." -- genesis 18:6
.
Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. -- genesis 18:7
.
He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed it before them; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate. -- genesis 18:8
.
Then they said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "There, in the tent." -- genesis 18:9
.
He said, "I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. -- genesis 18:10
.
Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing. -- genesis 18:11
.
Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?" -- genesis 18:12
.
And the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, when I am so old?' -- genesis 18:13
.
"Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son." -- genesis 18:14
.
Sarah denied it however, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. And He said, "No, but you did laugh." -- genesis 18:15
.
Then the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sodom; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off. -- genesis 18:16
.
The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, -- genesis 18:17
.
since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed? -- genesis 18:18
.
"For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him." -- genesis 18:19
.
And the LORD said, "The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. -- genesis 18:20
.
"I will go down now, and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know." -- genesis 18:21
.
Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the LORD. -- genesis 18:22
.
Abraham came near and said, "Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? -- genesis 18:23
.
"Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? -- genesis 18:24
.
"Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?" -- genesis 18:25
.
So the LORD said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account." -- genesis 18:26
.
And Abraham replied, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes. -- genesis 18:27
.
"Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of five?" And He said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there." -- genesis 18:28
.
He spoke to Him yet again and said, "Suppose forty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do it on account of the forty." -- genesis 18:29
.
Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do it if I find thirty there." -- genesis 18:30
.
And he said, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy it on account of the twenty." -- genesis 18:31
.
Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once; suppose ten are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy it on account of the ten." -- genesis 18:32
.
As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place. -- genesis 18:33
.
Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. -- genesis 19:1
.
And he said, "Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way." They said however, "No, but we shall spend the night in the square." -- genesis 19:2
.
Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. -- genesis 19:3
.
Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; -- genesis 19:4
.
and they called to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them." -- genesis 19:5
.
But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, -- genesis 19:6
.
and said, "Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. -- genesis 19:7
.
"Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof." -- genesis 19:8
.
But they said, "Stand aside." Furthermore, they said, "This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them." So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door. -- genesis 19:9
.
But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. -- genesis 19:10
.
They struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway. -- genesis 19:11
.
Then the two men said to Lot, "Whom else have you here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place; -- genesis 19:12
.
for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it." -- genesis 19:13
.
Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, "Up, get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy the city." But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting. -- genesis 19:14
.
When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city." -- genesis 19:15
.
But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out, and put him outside the city. -- genesis 19:16
.
When they had brought them outside, one said, "Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away." -- genesis 19:17
.
But Lot said to them, "Oh no, my lords! -- genesis 19:18
.
"Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die; -- genesis 19:19
.
now behold, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) that my life may be saved." -- genesis 19:20
.
He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken. -- genesis 19:21
.
"Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." Therefore the name of the town was called Zoar. -- genesis 19:22
.
The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar. -- genesis 19:23
.
Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven, -- genesis 19:24
.
and He overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. -- genesis 19:25
.
But his wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. -- genesis 19:26
.
Now Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD; -- genesis 19:27
.
and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace. -- genesis 19:28
.
Thus it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived. -- genesis 19:29
.
Lot went up from Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters. -- genesis 19:30
.
Then the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth. -- genesis 19:31
.
"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father." -- genesis 19:32
.
So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. -- genesis 19:33
.
On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father." -- genesis 19:34
.
So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. -- genesis 19:35
.
Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. -- genesis 19:36
.
The firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day. -- genesis 19:37
.
As for the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day. -- genesis 19:38
.
Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar. -- genesis 20:1
.
Abraham said of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. -- genesis 20:2
.
But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married." -- genesis 20:3
.
Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, "Lord, will You slay a nation, even though blameless? -- genesis 20:4
.
"Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this." -- genesis 20:5
.
Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her. -- genesis 20:6
.
"Now therefore, restore the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours." -- genesis 20:7
.
So Abimelech arose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly frightened. -- genesis 20:8
.
Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done." -- genesis 20:9
.
And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?" -- genesis 20:10
.
Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife. -- genesis 20:11
.
"Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife; -- genesis 20:12
.
and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is the kindness which you will show to me: everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'" -- genesis 20:13
.
Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him. -- genesis 20:14
.
Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please." -- genesis 20:15
.
To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is your vindication before all who are with you, and before all men you are cleared." -- genesis 20:16
.
Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore children. -- genesis 20:17
.
For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife. -- genesis 20:18
.
Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised. -- genesis 21:1
.
So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. -- genesis 21:2
.
Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. -- genesis 21:3
.
Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. -- genesis 21:4
.
Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. -- genesis 21:5
.
Sarah said, "God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me." -- genesis 21:6
.
And she said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age." -- genesis 21:7
.
The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. -- genesis 21:8
.
Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. -- genesis 21:9
.
Therefore she said to Abraham, "Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac." -- genesis 21:10
.
The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son. -- genesis 21:11
.
But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named. -- genesis 21:12
.
"And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant." -- genesis 21:13
.
So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. -- genesis 21:14
.
When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes. -- genesis 21:15
.
Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, "Do not let me see the boy die." And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept. -- genesis 21:16
.
God heard the lad crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is. -- genesis 21:17
.
"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him." -- genesis 21:18
.
Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink. -- genesis 21:19
.
God was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer. -- genesis 21:20
.
He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt. -- genesis 21:21
.
Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do; -- genesis 21:22
.
now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned." -- genesis 21:23
.
Abraham said, "I swear it." -- genesis 21:24
.
But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized. -- genesis 21:25
.
And Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today." -- genesis 21:26
.
Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. -- genesis 21:27
.
Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. -- genesis 21:28
.
Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?" -- genesis 21:29
.
He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well." -- genesis 21:30
.
Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath. -- genesis 21:31
.
So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines. -- genesis 21:32
.
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. -- genesis 21:33
.
And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days. -- genesis 21:34
.
Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am." -- genesis 22:1
.
He said, "Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you." -- genesis 22:2
.
So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. -- genesis 22:3
.
On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance. -- genesis 22:4
.
Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you." -- genesis 22:5
.
Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together. -- genesis 22:6
.
Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, "My father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." And he said, "Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" -- genesis 22:7
.
Abraham said, "God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together. -- genesis 22:8
.
Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. -- genesis 22:9
.
Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. -- genesis 22:10
.
But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am." -- genesis 22:11
.
He said, "Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me." -- genesis 22:12
.
Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son. -- genesis 22:13
.
Abraham called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, "In the mount of the LORD it will be provided." -- genesis 22:14
.
Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven, -- genesis 22:15
.
and said, "By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, -- genesis 22:16
.
indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. -- genesis 22:17
.
"In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice." -- genesis 22:18
.
So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived at Beersheba. -- genesis 22:19
.
Now it came about after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: -- genesis 22:20
.
Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram -- genesis 22:21
.
and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel." -- genesis 22:22
.
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah; these eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother. -- genesis 22:23
.
His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah. -- genesis 22:24
.
Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah. -- genesis 23:1
.
Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. -- genesis 23:2
.
Then Abraham rose from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, -- genesis 23:3
.
"I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight." -- genesis 23:4
.
The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, -- genesis 23:5
.
"Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead." -- genesis 23:6
.
So Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth. -- genesis 23:7
.
And he spoke with them, saying, "If it is your wish for me to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and approach Ephron the son of Zohar for me, -- genesis 23:8
.
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site." -- genesis 23:9
.
Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth; even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying, -- genesis 23:10
.
"No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead." -- genesis 23:11
.
And Abraham bowed before the people of the land. -- genesis 23:12
.
He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept it from me that I may bury my dead there." -- genesis 23:13
.
Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, -- genesis 23:14
.
"My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead." -- genesis 23:15
.
Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard. -- genesis 23:16
.
So Ephron's field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over -- genesis 23:17
.
to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. -- genesis 23:18
.
After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. -- genesis 23:19
.
So the field and the cave that is in it, were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth. -- genesis 23:20
.
Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in every way. -- genesis 24:1
.
Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, "Please place your hand under my thigh, -- genesis 24:2
.
and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live, -- genesis 24:3
.
but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac." -- genesis 24:4
.
The servant said to him, "Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?" -- genesis 24:5
.
Then Abraham said to him, "Beware that you do not take my son back there! -- genesis 24:6
.
"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, 'To your descendants I will give this land,' He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there. -- genesis 24:7
.
"But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath; only do not take my son back there." -- genesis 24:8
.
So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. -- genesis 24:9
.
Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master's in his hand; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. -- genesis 24:10
.
He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water. -- genesis 24:11
.
He said, "O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show lovingkindness to my master Abraham. -- genesis 24:12
.
"Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water; -- genesis 24:13
.
now may it be that the girl to whom I say, 'Please let down your jar so that I may drink,' and who answers, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also'--may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac; and by this I will know that You have shown lovingkindness to my master." -- genesis 24:14
.
Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder. -- genesis 24:15
.
The girl was very beautiful, a virgin, and no man had had relations with her; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. -- genesis 24:16
.
Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar." -- genesis 24:17
.
She said, "Drink, my lord"; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink. -- genesis 24:18
.
Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking." -- genesis 24:19
.
So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels. -- genesis 24:20
.
Meanwhile, the man was gazing at her in silence, to know whether the LORD had made his journey successful or not. -- genesis 24:21
.
When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold, -- genesis 24:22
.
and said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to lodge in your father's house?" -- genesis 24:23
.
She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor." -- genesis 24:24
.
Again she said to him, "We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to lodge in." -- genesis 24:25
.
Then the man bowed low and worshiped the LORD. -- genesis 24:26
.
He said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His lovingkindness and His truth toward my master; as for me, the LORD has guided me in the way to the house of my master's brothers." -- genesis 24:27
.
Then the girl ran and told her mother's household about these things. -- genesis 24:28
.
Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring. -- genesis 24:29
.
When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's wrists, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. -- genesis 24:30
.
And he said, "Come in, blessed of the LORD! Why do you stand outside since I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels?" -- genesis 24:31
.
So the man entered the house. Then Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. -- genesis 24:32
.
But when food was set before him to eat, he said, "I will not eat until I have told my business." And he said, "Speak on." -- genesis 24:33
.
So he said, "I am Abraham's servant. -- genesis 24:34
.
"The LORD has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys. -- genesis 24:35
.
"Now Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has. -- genesis 24:36
.
"My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; -- genesis 24:37
.
but you shall go to my father's house and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.' -- genesis 24:38
.
"I said to my master, 'Suppose the woman does not follow me.' -- genesis 24:39
.
"He said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father's house; -- genesis 24:40
.
then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.' -- genesis 24:41
.
"So I came today to the spring, and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now You will make my journey on which I go successful; -- genesis 24:42
.
behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar"; -- genesis 24:43
.
and she will say to me, "You drink, and I will draw for your camels also"; let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.' -- genesis 24:44
.
"Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, 'Please let me drink.' -- genesis 24:45
.
"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also'; so I drank, and she watered the camels also. -- genesis 24:46
.
"Then I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him'; and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists. -- genesis 24:47
.
"And I bowed low and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son. -- genesis 24:48
.
"So now if you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, let me know, that I may turn to the right hand or the left." -- genesis 24:49
.
Then Laban and Bethuel replied, "The matter comes from the LORD; so we cannot speak to you bad or good. -- genesis 24:50
.
"Here is Rebekah before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken." -- genesis 24:51
.
When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD. -- genesis 24:52
.
The servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother. -- genesis 24:53
.
Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master." -- genesis 24:54
.
But her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl stay with us a few days, say ten; afterward she may go." -- genesis 24:55
.
He said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master." -- genesis 24:56
.
And they said, "We will call the girl and consult her wishes." -- genesis 24:57
.
Then they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go." -- genesis 24:58
.
Thus they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham's servant and his men. -- genesis 24:59
.
They blessed Rebekah and said to her, "May you, our sister, Become thousands of ten thousands, And may your descendants possess The gate of those who hate them." -- genesis 24:60
.
Then Rebekah arose with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed. -- genesis 24:61
.
Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev. -- genesis 24:62
.
Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming. -- genesis 24:63
.
Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel. -- genesis 24:64
.
She said to the servant, "Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?" And the servant said, "He is my master." Then she took her veil and covered herself. -- genesis 24:65
.
The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. -- genesis 24:66
.
Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother's death. -- genesis 24:67
.
Now Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. -- genesis 25:1
.
She bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah. -- genesis 25:2
.
Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim. -- genesis 25:3
.
The sons of Midian were Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah. -- genesis 25:4
.
Now Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac; -- genesis 25:5
.
but to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the east. -- genesis 25:6
.
These are all the years of Abraham's life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years. -- genesis 25:7
.
Abraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old age, an old man and satisfied with life; and he was gathered to his people. -- genesis 25:8
.
Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre, -- genesis 25:9
.
the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. -- genesis 25:10
.
It came about after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi. -- genesis 25:11
.
Now these are the records of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham; -- genesis 25:12
.
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam -- genesis 25:13
.
and Mishma and Dumah and Massa, -- genesis 25:14
.
Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. -- genesis 25:15
.
These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps; twelve princes according to their tribes. -- genesis 25:16
.
These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. -- genesis 25:17
.
They settled from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria; he settled in defiance of all his relatives. -- genesis 25:18
.
Now these are the records of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham became the father of Isaac; -- genesis 25:19
.
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. -- genesis 25:20
.
Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD answered him and Rebekah his wife conceived. -- genesis 25:21
.
But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is so, why then am I this way?" So she went to inquire of the LORD. -- genesis 25:22
.
The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb; And two peoples will be separated from your body; And one people shall be stronger than the other; And the older shall serve the younger." -- genesis 25:23
.
When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. -- genesis 25:24
.
Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau. -- genesis 25:25
.
Afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them. -- genesis 25:26
.
When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a peaceful man, living in tents. -- genesis 25:27
.
Now Isaac loved Esau, because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. -- genesis 25:28
.
When Jacob had cooked stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished; -- genesis 25:29
.
and Esau said to Jacob, "Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom. -- genesis 25:30
.
But Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright." -- genesis 25:31
.
Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die; so of what use then is the birthright to me?" -- genesis 25:32
.
And Jacob said, "First swear to me"; so he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. -- genesis 25:33
.
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright. -- genesis 25:34
.
Now there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines. -- genesis 26:1
.
The LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I shall tell you. -- genesis 26:2
.
"Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless you, for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham. -- genesis 26:3
.
"I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; -- genesis 26:4
.
because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws." -- genesis 26:5
.
So Isaac lived in Gerar. -- genesis 26:6
.
When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "my wife," thinking, "the men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful." -- genesis 26:7
.
It came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was caressing his wife Rebekah. -- genesis 26:8
.
Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Behold, certainly she is your wife! How then did you say, 'She is my sister'?" And Isaac said to him, "Because I said, 'I might die on account of her.'" -- genesis 26:9
.
Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us." -- genesis 26:10
.
So Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death." -- genesis 26:11
.
Now Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him, -- genesis 26:12
.
and the man became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy; -- genesis 26:13
.
for he had possessions of flocks and herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him. -- genesis 26:14
.
Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with earth. -- genesis 26:15
.
Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us." -- genesis 26:16
.
And Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there. -- genesis 26:17
.
Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them. -- genesis 26:18
.
But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water, -- genesis 26:19
.
the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him. -- genesis 26:20
.
Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Sitnah. -- genesis 26:21
.
He moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth, for he said, "At last the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land." -- genesis 26:22
.
Then he went up from there to Beersheba. -- genesis 26:23
.
The LORD appeared to him the same night and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham; Do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your descendants, For the sake of My servant Abraham." -- genesis 26:24
.
So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well. -- genesis 26:25
.
Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and Phicol the commander of his army. -- genesis 26:26
.
Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?" -- genesis 26:27
.
They said, "We see plainly that the LORD has been with you; so we said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you, -- genesis 26:28
.
that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.'" -- genesis 26:29
.
Then he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. -- genesis 26:30
.
In the morning they arose early and exchanged oaths; then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace. -- genesis 26:31
.
Now it came about on the same day, that Isaac's servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water." -- genesis 26:32
.
So he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day. -- genesis 26:33
.
When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite; -- genesis 26:34
.
and they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah. -- genesis 26:35
.
Now it came about, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esau and said to him, "My son." And he said to him, "Here I am." -- genesis 27:1
.
Isaac said, "Behold now, I am old and I do not know the day of my death. -- genesis 27:2
.
"Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me; -- genesis 27:3
.
and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die." -- genesis 27:4
.
Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring home, -- genesis 27:5
.
Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying, -- genesis 27:6
.
'Bring me some game and prepare a savory dish for me, that I may eat, and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.' -- genesis 27:7
.
"Now therefore, my son, listen to me as I command you. -- genesis 27:8
.
"Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there, that I may prepare them as a savory dish for your father, such as he loves. -- genesis 27:9
.
"Then you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death." -- genesis 27:10
.
Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man. -- genesis 27:11
.
"Perhaps my father will feel me, then I will be as a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing." -- genesis 27:12
.
But his mother said to him, "Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me." -- genesis 27:13
.
So he went and got them, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savory food such as his father loved. -- genesis 27:14
.
Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. -- genesis 27:15
.
And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. -- genesis 27:16
.
She also gave the savory food and the bread, which she had made, to her son Jacob. -- genesis 27:17
.
Then he came to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?" -- genesis 27:18
.
Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Get up, please, sit and eat of my game, that you may bless me." -- genesis 27:19
.
Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have it so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because the LORD your God caused it to happen to me." -- genesis 27:20
.
Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come close, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not." -- genesis 27:21
.
So Jacob came close to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau." -- genesis 27:22
.
He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him. -- genesis 27:23
.
And he said, "Are you really my son Esau?" And he said, "I am." -- genesis 27:24
.
So he said, "Bring it to me, and I will eat of my son's game, that I may bless you." And he brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine and he drank. -- genesis 27:25
.
Then his father Isaac said to him, "Please come close and kiss me, my son." -- genesis 27:26
.
So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said, "See, the smell of my son Is like the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed; -- genesis 27:27
.
Now may God give you of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And an abundance of grain and new wine; -- genesis 27:28
.
May peoples serve you, And nations bow down to you; Be master of your brothers, And may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, And blessed be those who bless you." -- genesis 27:29
.
Now it came about, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had hardly gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. -- genesis 27:30
.
Then he also made savory food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me." -- genesis 27:31
.
Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau." -- genesis 27:32
.
Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who was he then that hunted game and brought it to me, so that I ate of all of it before you came, and blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed." -- genesis 27:33
.
When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father!" -- genesis 27:34
.
And he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing." -- genesis 27:35
.
Then he said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." And he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?" -- genesis 27:36
.
But Isaac replied to Esau, "Behold, I have made him your master, and all his relatives I have given to him as servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. Now as for you then, what can I do, my son?" -- genesis 27:37
.
Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." So Esau lifted his voice and wept. -- genesis 27:38
.
Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, "Behold, away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling, And away from the dew of heaven from above. -- genesis 27:39
.
"By your sword you shall live, And your brother you shall serve; But it shall come about when you become restless, That you will break his yoke from your neck." -- genesis 27:40
.
So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob." -- genesis 27:41
.
Now when the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent and called her younger son Jacob, and said to him, "Behold your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you by planning to kill you. -- genesis 27:42
.
"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Haran, to my brother Laban! -- genesis 27:43
.
"Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury subsides, -- genesis 27:44
.
until your brother's anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?" -- genesis 27:45
.
Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?" -- genesis 27:46
.
So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. -- genesis 28:1
.
"Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother's brother. -- genesis 28:2
.
"May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples. -- genesis 28:3
.
"May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham." -- genesis 28:4
.
Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. -- genesis 28:5
.
Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take to himself a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he charged him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan," -- genesis 28:6
.
and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram. -- genesis 28:7
.
So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased his father Isaac; -- genesis 28:8
.
and Esau went to Ishmael, and married, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth. -- genesis 28:9
.
Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran. -- genesis 28:10
.
He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place. -- genesis 28:11
.
He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. -- genesis 28:12
.
And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants. -- genesis 28:13
.
"Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed. -- genesis 28:14
.
"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you." -- genesis 28:15
.
Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it." -- genesis 28:16
.
He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven." -- genesis 28:17
.
So Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top. -- genesis 28:18
.
He called the name of that place Bethel; however, previously the name of the city had been Luz. -- genesis 28:19
.
Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear, -- genesis 28:20
.
and I return to my father's house in safety, then the LORD will be my God. -- genesis 28:21
.
"This stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God's house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You." -- genesis 28:22
.
Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east. -- genesis 29:1
.
He looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for from that well they watered the flocks. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large. -- genesis 29:2
.
When all the flocks were gathered there, they would then roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well. -- genesis 29:3
.
Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where are you from?" And they said, "We are from Haran." -- genesis 29:4
.
He said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" And they said, "We know him." -- genesis 29:5
.
And he said to them, "Is it well with him?" And they said, "It is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep." -- genesis 29:6
.
He said, "Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them." -- genesis 29:7
.
But they said, "We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep." -- genesis 29:8
.
While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess. -- genesis 29:9
.
When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. -- genesis 29:10
.
Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted his voice and wept. -- genesis 29:11
.
Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father. -- genesis 29:12
.
So when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he related to Laban all these things. -- genesis 29:13
.
Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." And he stayed with him a month. -- genesis 29:14
.
Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?" -- genesis 29:15
.
Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. -- genesis 29:16
.
And Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful of form and face. -- genesis 29:17
.
Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel." -- genesis 29:18
.
Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me." -- genesis 29:19
.
So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her. -- genesis 29:20
.
Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my time is completed, that I may go in to her." -- genesis 29:21
.
Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast. -- genesis 29:22
.
Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah, and brought her to him; and Jacob went in to her. -- genesis 29:23
.
Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid. -- genesis 29:24
.
So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?" -- genesis 29:25
.
But Laban said, "It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the firstborn. -- genesis 29:26
.
"Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for another seven years." -- genesis 29:27
.
Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. -- genesis 29:28
.
Laban also gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid. -- genesis 29:29
.
So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and indeed he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years. -- genesis 29:30
.
Now the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. -- genesis 29:31
.
Leah conceived and bore a son and named him Reuben, for she said, "Because the LORD has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will love me." -- genesis 29:32
.
Then she conceived again and bore a son and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this son also." So she named him Simeon. -- genesis 29:33
.
She conceived again and bore a son and said, "Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore he was named Levi. -- genesis 29:34
.
And she conceived again and bore a son and said, "This time I will praise the LORD." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing. -- genesis 29:35
.
Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die." -- genesis 30:1
.
Then Jacob's anger burned against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?" -- genesis 30:2
.
She said, "Here is my maid Bilhah, go in to her that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children." -- genesis 30:3
.
So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her. -- genesis 30:4
.
Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. -- genesis 30:5
.
Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son." Therefore she named him Dan. -- genesis 30:6
.
Rachel's maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. -- genesis 30:7
.
So Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have indeed prevailed." And she named him Naphtali. -- genesis 30:8
.
When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. -- genesis 30:9
.
Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son. -- genesis 30:10
.
Then Leah said, "How fortunate!" So she named him Gad. -- genesis 30:11
.
Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. -- genesis 30:12
.
Then Leah said, "Happy am I! For women will call me happy." So she named him Asher. -- genesis 30:13
.
Now in the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes." -- genesis 30:14
.
But she said to her, "Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? And would you take my son's mandrakes also?" So Rachel said, "Therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes." -- genesis 30:15
.
When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, then Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night. -- genesis 30:16
.
God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. -- genesis 30:17
.
Then Leah said, "God has given me my wages because I gave my maid to my husband." So she named him Issachar. -- genesis 30:18
.
Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob. -- genesis 30:19
.
Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun. -- genesis 30:20
.
Afterward she bore a daughter and named her Dinah. -- genesis 30:21
.
Then God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb. -- genesis 30:22
.
So she conceived and bore a son and said, "God has taken away my reproach." -- genesis 30:23
.
She named him Joseph, saying, "May the LORD give me another son." -- genesis 30:24
.
Now it came about when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country. -- genesis 30:25
.
"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me depart; for you yourself know my service which I have rendered you." -- genesis 30:26
.
But Laban said to him, "If now it pleases you, stay with me; I have divined that the LORD has blessed me on your account." -- genesis 30:27
.
He continued, "Name me your wages, and I will give it." -- genesis 30:28
.
But he said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you and how your cattle have fared with me. -- genesis 30:29
.
"For you had little before I came and it has increased to a multitude, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?" -- genesis 30:30
.
So he said, "What shall I give you?" And Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flock: -- genesis 30:31
.
let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep and every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages. -- genesis 30:32
.
"So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, will be considered stolen." -- genesis 30:33
.
Laban said, "Good, let it be according to your word." -- genesis 30:34
.
So he removed on that day the striped and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one with white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons. -- genesis 30:35
.
And he put a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. -- genesis 30:36
.
Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods. -- genesis 30:37
.
He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, even in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink. -- genesis 30:38
.
So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. -- genesis 30:39
.
Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock. -- genesis 30:40
.
Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods; -- genesis 30:41
.
but when the flock was feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban's and the stronger Jacob's. -- genesis 30:42
.
So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys. -- genesis 30:43
.
Now Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth." -- genesis 31:1
.
Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not friendly toward him as formerly. -- genesis 31:2
.
Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you." -- genesis 31:3
.
So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field, -- genesis 31:4
.
and said to them, "I see your father's attitude, that it is not friendly toward me as formerly, but the God of my father has been with me. -- genesis 31:5
.
"You know that I have served your father with all my strength. -- genesis 31:6
.
"Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to hurt me. -- genesis 31:7
.
"If he spoke thus, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth striped. -- genesis 31:8
.
"Thus God has taken away your father's livestock and given them to me. -- genesis 31:9
.
"And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and mottled. -- genesis 31:10
.
"Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.' -- genesis 31:11
.
"He said, 'Lift up now your eyes and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. -- genesis 31:12
.
'I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.'" -- genesis 31:13
.
Rachel and Leah said to him, "Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father's house? -- genesis 31:14
.
"Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price. -- genesis 31:15
.
"Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you." -- genesis 31:16
.
Then Jacob arose and put his children and his wives upon camels; -- genesis 31:17
.
and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered, his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac. -- genesis 31:18
.
When Laban had gone to shear his flock, then Rachel stole the household idols that were her father's. -- genesis 31:19
.
And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing. -- genesis 31:20
.
So he fled with all that he had; and he arose and crossed the Euphrates River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead. -- genesis 31:21
.
When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, -- genesis 31:22
.
then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. -- genesis 31:23
.
God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, "Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad." -- genesis 31:24
.
Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead. -- genesis 31:25
.
Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword? -- genesis 31:26
.
"Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre; -- genesis 31:27
.
and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly. -- genesis 31:28
.
"It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.' -- genesis 31:29
.
"Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house; but why did you steal my gods?" -- genesis 31:30
.
Then Jacob replied to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force. -- genesis 31:31
.
"The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take it for yourself." For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. -- genesis 31:32
.
So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent. -- genesis 31:33
.
Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel's saddle, and she sat on them. And Laban felt through all the tent but did not find them. -- genesis 31:34
.
She said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is upon me." So he searched but did not find the household idols. -- genesis 31:35
.
Then Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob said to Laban, "What is my transgression? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me? -- genesis 31:36
.
"Though you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two. -- genesis 31:37
.
"These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks. -- genesis 31:38
.
"That which was torn of beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. You required it of my hand whether stolen by day or stolen by night. -- genesis 31:39
.
"Thus I was: by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. -- genesis 31:40
.
"These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times. -- genesis 31:41
.
"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night." -- genesis 31:42
.
Then Laban replied to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne? -- genesis 31:43
.
"So now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me." -- genesis 31:44
.
Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. -- genesis 31:45
.
Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. -- genesis 31:46
.
Now Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. -- genesis 31:47
.
Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me this day." Therefore it was named Galeed, -- genesis 31:48
.
and Mizpah, for he said, "May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other. -- genesis 31:49
.
"If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, see, God is witness between you and me." -- genesis 31:50
.
Laban said to Jacob, "Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me. -- genesis 31:51
.
"This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. -- genesis 31:52
.
"The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac. -- genesis 31:53
.
Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his kinsmen to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain. -- genesis 31:54
.
Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place. -- genesis 31:55
.
Now as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him. -- genesis 32:1
.
Jacob said when he saw them, "This is God's camp." So he named that place Mahanaim. -- genesis 32:2
.
Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. -- genesis 32:3
.
He also commanded them saying, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: 'Thus says your servant Jacob, "I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now; -- genesis 32:4
.
I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight."'" -- genesis 32:5
.
The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him." -- genesis 32:6
.
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two companies; -- genesis 32:7
.
for he said, "If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape." -- genesis 32:8
.
Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will prosper you,' -- genesis 32:9
.
I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant; for with my staff only I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two companies. -- genesis 32:10
.
"Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children. -- genesis 32:11
.
"For You said, 'I will surely prosper you and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be numbered.'" -- genesis 32:12
.
So he spent the night there. Then he selected from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau: -- genesis 32:13
.
two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, -- genesis 32:14
.
thirty milking camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. -- genesis 32:15
.
He delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on before me, and put a space between droves." -- genesis 32:16
.
He commanded the one in front, saying, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, saying, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?' -- genesis 32:17
.
then you shall say, 'These belong to your servant Jacob; it is a present sent to my lord Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.'" -- genesis 32:18
.
Then he commanded also the second and the third, and all those who followed the droves, saying, "After this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him; -- genesis 32:19
.
and you shall say, 'Behold, your servant Jacob also is behind us.'" For he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me. Then afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me." -- genesis 32:20
.
So the present passed on before him, while he himself spent that night in the camp. -- genesis 32:21
.
Now he arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. -- genesis 32:22
.
He took them and sent them across the stream. And he sent across whatever he had. -- genesis 32:23
.
Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak. -- genesis 32:24
.
When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob's thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him. -- genesis 32:25
.
Then he said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." But he said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me." -- genesis 32:26
.
So he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob." -- genesis 32:27
.
He said, "Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have striven with God and with men and have prevailed." -- genesis 32:28
.
Then Jacob asked him and said, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And he blessed him there. -- genesis 32:29
.
So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, "I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been preserved." -- genesis 32:30
.
Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penuel, and he was limping on his thigh. -- genesis 32:31
.
Therefore, to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip. -- genesis 32:32
.
Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids. -- genesis 33:1
.
He put the maids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last. -- genesis 33:2
.
But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. -- genesis 33:3
.
Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. -- genesis 33:4
.
He lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, "Who are these with you?" So he said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant." -- genesis 33:5
.
Then the maids came near with their children, and they bowed down. -- genesis 33:6
.
Leah likewise came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down. -- genesis 33:7
.
And he said, "What do you mean by all this company which I have met?" And he said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord." -- genesis 33:8
.
But Esau said, "I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own." -- genesis 33:9
.
Jacob said, "No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand, for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably. -- genesis 33:10
.
"Please take my gift which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have plenty." Thus he urged him and he took it. -- genesis 33:11
.
Then Esau said, "Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you." -- genesis 33:12
.
But he said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me. And if they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die. -- genesis 33:13
.
"Please let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir." -- genesis 33:14
.
Esau said, "Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord." -- genesis 33:15
.
So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. -- genesis 33:16
.
Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for himself a house and made booths for his livestock; therefore the place is named Succoth. -- genesis 33:17
.
Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city. -- genesis 33:18
.
He bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money. -- genesis 33:19
.
Then he erected there an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel. -- genesis 33:20
.
Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land. -- genesis 34:1
.
When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force. -- genesis 34:2
.
He was deeply attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her. -- genesis 34:3
.
So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this young girl for a wife." -- genesis 34:4
.
Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept silent until they came in. -- genesis 34:5
.
Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. -- genesis 34:6
.
Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done. -- genesis 34:7
.
But Hamor spoke with them, saying, "The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage. -- genesis 34:8
.
"Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves. -- genesis 34:9
.
"Thus you shall live with us, and the land shall be open before you; live and trade in it and acquire property in it." -- genesis 34:10
.
Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, "If I find favor in your sight, then I will give whatever you say to me. -- genesis 34:11
.
"Ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift, and I will give according as you say to me; but give me the girl in marriage." -- genesis 34:12
.
But Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor with deceit, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. -- genesis 34:13
.
They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. -- genesis 34:14
.
"Only on this condition will we consent to you: if you will become like us, in that every male of you be circumcised, -- genesis 34:15
.
then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people. -- genesis 34:16
.
"But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go." -- genesis 34:17
.
Now their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son. -- genesis 34:18
.
The young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. Now he was more respected than all the household of his father. -- genesis 34:19
.
So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, -- genesis 34:20
.
"These men are friendly with us; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage, and give our daughters to them. -- genesis 34:21
.
"Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised. -- genesis 34:22
.
"Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will live with us." -- genesis 34:23
.
All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. -- genesis 34:24
.
Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares, and killed every male. -- genesis 34:25
.
They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem's house, and went forth. -- genesis 34:26
.
Jacob's sons came upon the slain and looted the city, because they had defiled their sister. -- genesis 34:27
.
They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field; -- genesis 34:28
.
and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, even all that was in the houses. -- genesis 34:29
.
Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and my men being few in number, they will gather together against me and attack me and I will be destroyed, I and my household." -- genesis 34:30
.
But they said, "Should he treat our sister as a harlot?" -- genesis 34:31
.
Then God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau." -- genesis 35:1
.
So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods which are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments; -- genesis 35:2
.
and let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone." -- genesis 35:3
.
So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem. -- genesis 35:4
.
As they journeyed, there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. -- genesis 35:5
.
So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. -- genesis 35:6
.
He built an altar there, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother. -- genesis 35:7
.
Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; it was named Allon-bacuth. -- genesis 35:8
.
Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him. -- genesis 35:9
.
God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; You shall no longer be called Jacob, But Israel shall be your name." Thus He called him Israel. -- genesis 35:10
.
God also said to him, "I am God Almighty; Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, And kings shall come forth from you. -- genesis 35:11
.
"The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, And I will give the land to your descendants after you." -- genesis 35:12
.
Then God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him. -- genesis 35:13
.
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. -- genesis 35:14
.
So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel. -- genesis 35:15
.
Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe labor. -- genesis 35:16
.
When she was in severe labor the midwife said to her, "Do not fear, for now you have another son." -- genesis 35:17
.
It came about as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin. -- genesis 35:18
.
So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). -- genesis 35:19
.
Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day. -- genesis 35:20
.
Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. -- genesis 35:21
.
It came about while Israel was dwelling in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it. Now there were twelve sons of Jacob-- -- genesis 35:22
.
the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun; -- genesis 35:23
.
the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; -- genesis 35:24
.
and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naphtali; -- genesis 35:25
.
and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram. -- genesis 35:26
.
Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. -- genesis 35:27
.
Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. -- genesis 35:28
.
Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, an old man of ripe age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. -- genesis 35:29
.
Now these are the records of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). -- genesis 36:1
.
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite; -- genesis 36:2
.
also Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth. -- genesis 36:3
.
Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel, -- genesis 36:4
.
and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan. -- genesis 36:5
.
Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his goods which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to another land away from his brother Jacob. -- genesis 36:6
.
For their property had become too great for them to live together, and the land where they sojourned could not sustain them because of their livestock. -- genesis 36:7
.
So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom. -- genesis 36:8
.
These then are the records of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir. -- genesis 36:9
.
These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau's wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau's wife Basemath. -- genesis 36:10
.
The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho and Gatam and Kenaz. -- genesis 36:11
.
Timna was a concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau's wife Adah. -- genesis 36:12
.
These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife Basemath. -- genesis 36:13
.
These were the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon: she bore to Esau, Jeush and Jalam and Korah. -- genesis 36:14
.
These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, are chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, -- genesis 36:15
.
chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah. -- genesis 36:16
.
These are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Esau's wife Basemath. -- genesis 36:17
.
These are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. -- genesis 36:18
.
These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs. -- genesis 36:19
.
These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah, -- genesis 36:20
.
and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. -- genesis 36:21
.
The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. -- genesis 36:22
.
These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam. -- genesis 36:23
.
These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah--he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon. -- genesis 36:24
.
These are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. -- genesis 36:25
.
These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran. -- genesis 36:26
.
These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan. -- genesis 36:27
.
These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. -- genesis 36:28
.
These are the chiefs descended from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, -- genesis 36:29
.
chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, according to their various chiefs in the land of Seir. -- genesis 36:30
.
Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel. -- genesis 36:31
.
Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. -- genesis 36:32
.
Then Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah became king in his place. -- genesis 36:33
.
Then Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites became king in his place. -- genesis 36:34
.
Then Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, became king in his place; and the name of his city was Avith. -- genesis 36:35
.
Then Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah became king in his place. -- genesis 36:36
.
Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the Euphrates River became king in his place. -- genesis 36:37
.
Then Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor became king in his place. -- genesis 36:38
.
Then Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar became king in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab. -- genesis 36:39
.
Now these are the names of the chiefs descended from Esau, according to their families and their localities, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, -- genesis 36:40
.
chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, -- genesis 36:41
.
chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, -- genesis 36:42
.
chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of the Edomites), according to their habitations in the land of their possession. -- genesis 36:43
.
Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan. -- genesis 37:1
.
These are the records of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, when seventeen years of age, was pasturing the flock with his brothers while he was still a youth, along with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father. -- genesis 37:2
.
Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a varicolored tunic. -- genesis 37:3
.
His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms. -- genesis 37:4
.
Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. -- genesis 37:5
.
He said to them, "Please listen to this dream which I have had; -- genesis 37:6
.
for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf rose up and also stood erect; and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf." -- genesis 37:7
.
Then his brothers said to him, "Are you actually going to reign over us? Or are you really going to rule over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words. -- genesis 37:8
.
Now he had still another dream, and related it to his brothers, and said, "Lo, I have had still another dream; and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me." -- genesis 37:9
.
He related it to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have had? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow ourselves down before you to the ground?" -- genesis 37:10
.
His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind. -- genesis 37:11
.
Then his brothers went to pasture their father's flock in Shechem. -- genesis 37:12
.
Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." And he said to him, "I will go." -- genesis 37:13
.
Then he said to him, "Go now and see about the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flock, and bring word back to me." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. -- genesis 37:14
.
A man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, "What are you looking for?" -- genesis 37:15
.
He said, "I am looking for my brothers; please tell me where they are pasturing the flock." -- genesis 37:16
.
Then the man said, "They have moved from here; for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan. -- genesis 37:17
.
When they saw him from a distance and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to death. -- genesis 37:18
.
They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer! -- genesis 37:19
.
"Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, 'A wild beast devoured him.' Then let us see what will become of his dreams!" -- genesis 37:20
.
But Reuben heard this and rescued him out of their hands and said, "Let us not take his life." -- genesis 37:21
.
Reuben further said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hands on him"--that he might rescue him out of their hands, to restore him to his father. -- genesis 37:22
.
So it came about, when Joseph reached his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the varicolored tunic that was on him; -- genesis 37:23
.
and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, without any water in it. -- genesis 37:24
.
Then they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring them down to Egypt. -- genesis 37:25
.
Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover up his blood? -- genesis 37:26
.
"Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers listened to him. -- genesis 37:27
.
Then some Midianite traders passed by, so they pulled him up and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. Thus they brought Joseph into Egypt. -- genesis 37:28
.
Now Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; so he tore his garments. -- genesis 37:29
.
He returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is not there; as for me, where am I to go?" -- genesis 37:30
.
So they took Joseph's tunic, and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood; -- genesis 37:31
.
and they sent the varicolored tunic and brought it to their father and said, "We found this; please examine it to see whether it is your son's tunic or not." -- genesis 37:32
.
Then he examined it and said, "It is my son's tunic. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!" -- genesis 37:33
.
So Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. -- genesis 37:34
.
Then all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. And he said, "Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son." So his father wept for him. -- genesis 37:35
.
Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's officer, the captain of the bodyguard. -- genesis 37:36
.
And it came about at that time, that Judah departed from his brothers and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. -- genesis 38:1
.
Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her and went in to her. -- genesis 38:2
.
So she conceived and bore a son and he named him Er. -- genesis 38:3
.
Then she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan. -- genesis 38:4
.
She bore still another son and named him Shelah; and it was at Chezib that she bore him. -- genesis 38:5
.
Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. -- genesis 38:6
.
But Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD took his life. -- genesis 38:7
.
Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother." -- genesis 38:8
.
Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother. -- genesis 38:9
.
But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life also. -- genesis 38:10
.
Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up"; for he thought, "I am afraid that he too may die like his brothers." So Tamar went and lived in her father's house. -- genesis 38:11
.
Now after a considerable time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and when the time of mourning was ended, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. -- genesis 38:12
.
It was told to Tamar, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep." -- genesis 38:13
.
So she removed her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gateway of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife. -- genesis 38:14
.
When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face. -- genesis 38:15
.
So he turned aside to her by the road, and said, "Here now, let me come in to you"; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?" -- genesis 38:16
.
He said, therefore, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." She said, moreover, "Will you give a pledge until you send it?" -- genesis 38:17
.
He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" And she said, "Your seal and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him. -- genesis 38:18
.
Then she arose and departed, and removed her veil and put on her widow's garments. -- genesis 38:19
.
When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her. -- genesis 38:20
.
He asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?" But they said, "There has been no temple prostitute here." -- genesis 38:21
.
So he returned to Judah, and said, "I did not find her; and furthermore, the men of the place said, 'There has been no temple prostitute here.'" -- genesis 38:22
.
Then Judah said, "Let her keep them, otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her." -- genesis 38:23
.
Now it was about three months later that Judah was informed, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot, and behold, she is also with child by harlotry." Then Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned!" -- genesis 38:24
.
It was while she was being brought out that she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "I am with child by the man to whom these things belong." And she said, "Please examine and see, whose signet ring and cords and staff are these?" -- genesis 38:25
.
Judah recognized them, and said, "She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not have relations with her again. -- genesis 38:26
.
It came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb. -- genesis 38:27
.
Moreover, it took place while she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This one came out first." -- genesis 38:28
.
But it came about as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out. Then she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" So he was named Perez. -- genesis 38:29
.
Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and he was named Zerah. -- genesis 38:30
.
Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there. -- genesis 39:1
.
The LORD was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. -- genesis 39:2
.
Now his master saw that the LORD was with him and how the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hand. -- genesis 39:3
.
So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge. -- genesis 39:4
.
It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph; thus the LORD'S blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field. -- genesis 39:5
.
So he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge; and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. -- genesis 39:6
.
It came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me." -- genesis 39:7
.
But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put all that he owns in my charge. -- genesis 39:8
.
"There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?" -- genesis 39:9
.
As she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her. -- genesis 39:10
.
Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household was there inside. -- genesis 39:11
.
She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside. -- genesis 39:12
.
When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, -- genesis 39:13
.
she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed. -- genesis 39:14
.
"When he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside." -- genesis 39:15
.
So she left his garment beside her until his master came home. -- genesis 39:16
.
Then she spoke to him with these words, "The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make sport of me; -- genesis 39:17
.
and as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside." -- genesis 39:18
.
Now when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your slave did to me," his anger burned. -- genesis 39:19
.
So Joseph's master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king's prisoners were confined; and he was there in the jail. -- genesis 39:20
.
But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer. -- genesis 39:21
.
The chief jailer committed to Joseph's charge all the prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there, he was responsible for it. -- genesis 39:22
.
The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph's charge because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made to prosper. -- genesis 39:23
.
Then it came about after these things, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt. -- genesis 40:1
.
Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. -- genesis 40:2
.
So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the jail, the same place where Joseph was imprisoned. -- genesis 40:3
.
The captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them; and they were in confinement for some time. -- genesis 40:4
.
Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in jail, both had a dream the same night, each man with his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation. -- genesis 40:5
.
When Joseph came to them in the morning and observed them, behold, they were dejected. -- genesis 40:6
.
He asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in confinement in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?" -- genesis 40:7
.
Then they said to him, "We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, please." -- genesis 40:8
.
So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream, behold, there was a vine in front of me; -- genesis 40:9
.
and on the vine were three branches. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. -- genesis 40:10
.
"Now Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh's hand." -- genesis 40:11
.
Then Joseph said to him, "This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; -- genesis 40:12
.
within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer. -- genesis 40:13
.
"Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house. -- genesis 40:14
.
"For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon." -- genesis 40:15
.
When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph, "I also saw in my dream, and behold, there were three baskets of white bread on my head; -- genesis 40:16
.
and in the top basket there were some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head." -- genesis 40:17
.
Then Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days; -- genesis 40:18
.
within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you." -- genesis 40:19
.
Thus it came about on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants. -- genesis 40:20
.
He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand; -- genesis 40:21
.
but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them. -- genesis 40:22
.
Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him. -- genesis 40:23
.
Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile. -- genesis 41:1
.
And lo, from the Nile there came up seven cows, sleek and fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass. -- genesis 41:2
.
Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. -- genesis 41:3
.
The ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. -- genesis 41:4
.
He fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good. -- genesis 41:5
.
Then behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. -- genesis 41:6
.
The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. -- genesis 41:7
.
Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh. -- genesis 41:8
.
Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I would make mention today of my own offenses. -- genesis 41:9
.
"Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, both me and the chief baker. -- genesis 41:10
.
"We had a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream. -- genesis 41:11
.
"Now a Hebrew youth was with us there, a servant of the captain of the bodyguard, and we related them to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us. To each one he interpreted according to his own dream. -- genesis 41:12
.
"And just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; he restored me in my office, but he hanged him." -- genesis 41:13
.
Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh. -- genesis 41:14
.
Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it." -- genesis 41:15
.
Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, "It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer." -- genesis 41:16
.
So Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile; -- genesis 41:17
.
and behold, seven cows, fat and sleek came up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the marsh grass. -- genesis 41:18
.
"Lo, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such as I had never seen for ugliness in all the land of Egypt; -- genesis 41:19
.
and the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows. -- genesis 41:20
.
"Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had devoured them, for they were just as ugly as before. Then I awoke. -- genesis 41:21
.
"I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears, full and good, came up on a single stalk; -- genesis 41:22
.
and lo, seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them; -- genesis 41:23
.
and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. Then I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me." -- genesis 41:24
.
Now Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same; God has told to Pharaoh what He is about to do. -- genesis 41:25
.
"The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one and the same. -- genesis 41:26
.
"The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine. -- genesis 41:27
.
"It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown to Pharaoh what He is about to do. -- genesis 41:28
.
"Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt; -- genesis 41:29
.
and after them seven years of famine will come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will ravage the land. -- genesis 41:30
.
"So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it will be very severe. -- genesis 41:31
.
"Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it means that the matter is determined by God, and God will quickly bring it about. -- genesis 41:32
.
"Now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. -- genesis 41:33
.
"Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land, and let him exact a fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance. -- genesis 41:34
.
"Then let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh's authority, and let them guard it. -- genesis 41:35
.
"Let the food become as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land will not perish during the famine." -- genesis 41:36
.
Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants. -- genesis 41:37
.
Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is a divine spirit?" -- genesis 41:38
.
So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are. -- genesis 41:39
.
"You shall be over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage; only in the throne I will be greater than you." -- genesis 41:40
.
Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." -- genesis 41:41
.
Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck. -- genesis 41:42
.
He had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed before him, "Bow the knee!" And he set him over all the land of Egypt. -- genesis 41:43
.
Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt." -- genesis 41:44
.
Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt. -- genesis 41:45
.
Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt. -- genesis 41:46
.
During the seven years of plenty the land brought forth abundantly. -- genesis 41:47
.
So he gathered all the food of these seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities; he placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields. -- genesis 41:48
.
Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure. -- genesis 41:49
.
Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. -- genesis 41:50
.
Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household." -- genesis 41:51
.
He named the second Ephraim, "For," he said, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction." -- genesis 41:52
.
When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt came to an end, -- genesis 41:53
.
and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. -- genesis 41:54
.
So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do." -- genesis 41:55
.
When the famine was spread over all the face of the earth, then Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. -- genesis 41:56
.
The people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth. -- genesis 41:57
.
Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, "Why are you staring at one another?" -- genesis 42:1
.
He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die." -- genesis 42:2
.
Then ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt. -- genesis 42:3
.
But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, "I am afraid that harm may befall him." -- genesis 42:4
.
So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who were coming, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also. -- genesis 42:5
.
Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. -- genesis 42:6
.
When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. And he said to them, "Where have you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food." -- genesis 42:7
.
But Joseph had recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him. -- genesis 42:8
.
Joseph remembered the dreams which he had about them, and said to them, "You are spies; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land." -- genesis 42:9
.
Then they said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. -- genesis 42:10
.
"We are all sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies." -- genesis 42:11
.
Yet he said to them, "No, but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land!" -- genesis 42:12
.
But they said, "Your servants are twelve brothers in all, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive." -- genesis 42:13
.
Joseph said to them, "It is as I said to you, you are spies; -- genesis 42:14
.
by this you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here! -- genesis 42:15
.
"Send one of you that he may get your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies." -- genesis 42:16
.
So he put them all together in prison for three days. -- genesis 42:17
.
Now Joseph said to them on the third day, "Do this and live, for I fear God: -- genesis 42:18
.
if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison; but as for the rest of you, go, carry grain for the famine of your households, -- genesis 42:19
.
and bring your youngest brother to me, so your words may be verified, and you will not die." And they did so. -- genesis 42:20
.
Then they said to one another, "Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us." -- genesis 42:21
.
Reuben answered them, saying, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy'; and you would not listen? Now comes the reckoning for his blood." -- genesis 42:22
.
They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them. -- genesis 42:23
.
He turned away from them and wept. But when he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. -- genesis 42:24
.
Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them. -- genesis 42:25
.
So they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there. -- genesis 42:26
.
As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. -- genesis 42:27
.
Then he said to his brothers, "My money has been returned, and behold, it is even in my sack." And their hearts sank, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?" -- genesis 42:28
.
When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, -- genesis 42:29
.
"The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us, and took us for spies of the country. -- genesis 42:30
.
"But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies. -- genesis 42:31
.
'We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.' -- genesis 42:32
.
"The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your households, and go. -- genesis 42:33
.
'But bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.'" -- genesis 42:34
.
Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed. -- genesis 42:35
.
Their father Jacob said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me." -- genesis 42:36
.
Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you." -- genesis 42:37
.
But Jacob said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow." -- genesis 42:38
.
Now the famine was severe in the land. -- genesis 43:1
.
So it came about when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, "Go back, buy us a little food." -- genesis 43:2
.
Judah spoke to him, however, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.' -- genesis 43:3
.
"If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. -- genesis 43:4
.
"But if you do not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'" -- genesis 43:5
.
Then Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man whether you still had another brother?" -- genesis 43:6
.
But they said, "The man questioned particularly about us and our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' So we answered his questions. Could we possibly know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?" -- genesis 43:7
.
Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the lad with me and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, we as well as you and our little ones. -- genesis 43:8
.
"I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame before you forever. -- genesis 43:9
.
"For if we had not delayed, surely by now we could have returned twice." -- genesis 43:10
.
Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man as a present, a little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds. -- genesis 43:11
.
"Take double the money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake. -- genesis 43:12
.
"Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man; -- genesis 43:13
.
and may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved." -- genesis 43:14
.
So the men took this present, and they took double the money in their hand, and Benjamin; then they arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph. -- genesis 43:15
.
When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, "Bring the men into the house, and slay an animal and make ready; for the men are to dine with me at noon." -- genesis 43:16
.
So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph's house. -- genesis 43:17
.
Now the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, "It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, and take us for slaves with our donkeys." -- genesis 43:18
.
So they came near to Joseph's house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house, -- genesis 43:19
.
and said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food, -- genesis 43:20
.
and it came about when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand. -- genesis 43:21
.
"We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks." -- genesis 43:22
.
He said, "Be at ease, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them. -- genesis 43:23
.
Then the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder. -- genesis 43:24
.
So they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there. -- genesis 43:25
.
When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which was in their hand and bowed to the ground before him. -- genesis 43:26
.
Then he asked them about their welfare, and said, "Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?" -- genesis 43:27
.
They said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." They bowed down in homage. -- genesis 43:28
.
As he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, he said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" And he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son." -- genesis 43:29
.
Joseph hurried out for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he sought a place to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there. -- genesis 43:30
.
Then he washed his face and came out; and he controlled himself and said, "Serve the meal." -- genesis 43:31
.
So they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is loathsome to the Egyptians. -- genesis 43:32
.
Now they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment. -- genesis 43:33
.
He took portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely with him. -- genesis 43:34
.
Then he commanded his house steward, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack. -- genesis 44:1
.
"Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain." And he did as Joseph had told him. -- genesis 44:2
.
As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys. -- genesis 44:3
.
They had just gone out of the city, and were not far off, when Joseph said to his house steward, "Up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good? -- genesis 44:4
.
'Is not this the one from which my lord drinks and which he indeed uses for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.'" -- genesis 44:5
.
So he overtook them and spoke these words to them. -- genesis 44:6
.
They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing. -- genesis 44:7
.
"Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house? -- genesis 44:8
.
"With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves." -- genesis 44:9
.
So he said, "Now let it also be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be innocent." -- genesis 44:10
.
Then they hurried, each man lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack. -- genesis 44:11
.
He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. -- genesis 44:12
.
Then they tore their clothes, and when each man loaded his donkey, they returned to the city. -- genesis 44:13
.
When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him. -- genesis 44:14
.
Joseph said to them, "What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed practice divination?" -- genesis 44:15
.
So Judah said, "What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been found." -- genesis 44:16
.
But he said, "Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose possession the cup has been found, he shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father." -- genesis 44:17
.
Then Judah approached him, and said, "Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh. -- genesis 44:18
.
"My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father or a brother?' -- genesis 44:19
.
"We said to my lord, 'We have an old father and a little child of his old age. Now his brother is dead, so he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.' -- genesis 44:20
.
"Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes on him.' -- genesis 44:21
.
"But we said to my lord, 'The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.' -- genesis 44:22
.
"You said to your servants, however, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.' -- genesis 44:23
.
"Thus it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. -- genesis 44:24
.
"Our father said, 'Go back, buy us a little food.' -- genesis 44:25
.
"But we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.' -- genesis 44:26
.
"Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons; -- genesis 44:27
.
and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces," and I have not seen him since. -- genesis 44:28
.
'If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.' -- genesis 44:29
.
"Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad's life, -- genesis 44:30
.
when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die. Thus your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow. -- genesis 44:31
.
"For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then let me bear the blame before my father forever.' -- genesis 44:32
.
"Now, therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers. -- genesis 44:33
.
"For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me--for fear that I see the evil that would overtake my father?" -- genesis 44:34
.
Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, "Have everyone go out from me." So there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. -- genesis 45:1
.
He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard of it. -- genesis 45:2
.
Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence. -- genesis 45:3
.
Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Please come closer to me." And they came closer. And he said, "I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. -- genesis 45:4
.
"Now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. -- genesis 45:5
.
"For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting. -- genesis 45:6
.
"God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance. -- genesis 45:7
.
"Now, therefore, it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt. -- genesis 45:8
.
"Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, "God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. -- genesis 45:9
.
"You shall live in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have. -- genesis 45:10
.
"There I will also provide for you, for there are still five years of famine to come, and you and your household and all that you have would be impoverished."' -- genesis 45:11
.
"Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which is speaking to you. -- genesis 45:12
.
"Now you must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and all that you have seen; and you must hurry and bring my father down here." -- genesis 45:13
.
Then he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. -- genesis 45:14
.
He kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him. -- genesis 45:15
.
Now when the news was heard in Pharaoh's house that Joseph's brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. -- genesis 45:16
.
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan, -- genesis 45:17
.
and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you will eat the fat of the land.' -- genesis 45:18
.
"Now you are ordered, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come. -- genesis 45:19
.
'Do not concern yourselves with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'" -- genesis 45:20
.
Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. -- genesis 45:21
.
To each of them he gave changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments. -- genesis 45:22
.
To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and sustenance for his father on the journey. -- genesis 45:23
.
So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, "Do not quarrel on the journey." -- genesis 45:24
.
Then they went up from Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob. -- genesis 45:25
.
They told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." But he was stunned, for he did not believe them. -- genesis 45:26
.
When they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. -- genesis 45:27
.
Then Israel said, "It is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die." -- genesis 45:28
.
So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. -- genesis 46:1
.
God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am." -- genesis 46:2
.
He said, "I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there. -- genesis 46:3
.
"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again; and Joseph will close your eyes." -- genesis 46:4
.
Then Jacob arose from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. -- genesis 46:5
.
They took their livestock and their property, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him: -- genesis 46:6
.
his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt. -- genesis 46:7
.
Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. -- genesis 46:8
.
The sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi. -- genesis 46:9
.
The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. -- genesis 46:10
.
The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. -- genesis 46:11
.
The sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. -- genesis 46:12
.
The sons of Issachar: Tola and Puvvah and Iob and Shimron. -- genesis 46:13
.
The sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel. -- genesis 46:14
.
These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three. -- genesis 46:15
.
The sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli. -- genesis 46:16
.
The sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. -- genesis 46:17
.
These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons. -- genesis 46:18
.
The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. -- genesis 46:19
.
Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. -- genesis 46:20
.
The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard. -- genesis 46:21
.
These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; there were fourteen persons in all. -- genesis 46:22
.
The sons of Dan: Hushim. -- genesis 46:23
.
The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem. -- genesis 46:24
.
These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob; there were seven persons in all. -- genesis 46:25
.
All the persons belonging to Jacob, who came to Egypt, his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob's sons, were sixty-six persons in all, -- genesis 46:26
.
and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy. -- genesis 46:27
.
Now he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out the way before him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. -- genesis 46:28
.
Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time. -- genesis 46:29
.
Then Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive." -- genesis 46:30
.
Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me; -- genesis 46:31
.
and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.' -- genesis 46:32
.
"When Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?' -- genesis 46:33
.
you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians." -- genesis 46:34
.
Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen." -- genesis 47:1
.
He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. -- genesis 47:2
.
Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" So they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers." -- genesis 47:3
.
They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now, therefore, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen." -- genesis 47:4
.
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you. -- genesis 47:5
.
"The land of Egypt is at your disposal; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land, let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock." -- genesis 47:6
.
Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. -- genesis 47:7
.
Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many years have you lived?" -- genesis 47:8
.
So Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty; few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, nor have they attained the years that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning." -- genesis 47:9
.
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from his presence. -- genesis 47:10
.
So Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered. -- genesis 47:11
.
Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to their little ones. -- genesis 47:12
.
Now there was no food in all the land, because the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. -- genesis 47:13
.
Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. -- genesis 47:14
.
When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For our money is gone." -- genesis 47:15
.
Then Joseph said, "Give up your livestock, and I will give you food for your livestock, since your money is gone." -- genesis 47:16
.
So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. -- genesis 47:17
.
When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent, and the cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our lands. -- genesis 47:18
.
"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. So give us seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate." -- genesis 47:19
.
So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh's. -- genesis 47:20
.
As for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of Egypt's border to the other. -- genesis 47:21
.
Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they did not sell their land. -- genesis 47:22
.
Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have today bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, here is seed for you, and you may sow the land. -- genesis 47:23
.
"At the harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and as food for your little ones." -- genesis 47:24
.
So they said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves." -- genesis 47:25
.
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt valid to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh's. -- genesis 47:26
.
Now Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in Goshen, and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and became very numerous. -- genesis 47:27
.
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the length of Jacob's life was one hundred and forty-seven years. -- genesis 47:28
.
When the time for Israel to die drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "Please, if I have found favor in your sight, place now your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and faithfulness. Please do not bury me in Egypt, -- genesis 47:29
.
but when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." And he said, "I will do as you have said." -- genesis 47:30
.
He said, "Swear to me." So he swore to him. Then Israel bowed in worship at the head of the bed. -- genesis 47:31
.
Now it came about after these things that Joseph was told, "Behold, your father is sick." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him. -- genesis 48:1
.
When it was told to Jacob, "Behold, your son Joseph has come to you," Israel collected his strength and sat up in the bed. -- genesis 48:2
.
Then Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, -- genesis 48:3
.
and He said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.' -- genesis 48:4
.
"Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. -- genesis 48:5
.
"But your offspring that have been born after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the names of their brothers in their inheritance. -- genesis 48:6
.
"Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, in the land of Canaan on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)." -- genesis 48:7
.
When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?" -- genesis 48:8
.
Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." So he said, "Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them." -- genesis 48:9
.
Now the eyes of Israel were so dim from age that he could not see. Then Joseph brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. -- genesis 48:10
.
Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face, and behold, God has let me see your children as well." -- genesis 48:11
.
Then Joseph took them from his knees, and bowed with his face to the ground. -- genesis 48:12
.
Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right, and brought them close to him. -- genesis 48:13
.
But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, crossing his hands, although Manasseh was the firstborn. -- genesis 48:14
.
He blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, -- genesis 48:15
.
The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; And may my name live on in them, And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth." -- genesis 48:16
.
When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him; and he grasped his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. -- genesis 48:17
.
Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand on his head." -- genesis 48:18
.
But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know; he also will become a people and he also will be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations." -- genesis 48:19
.
He blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will pronounce blessing, saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!'" Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. -- genesis 48:20
.
Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers. -- genesis 48:21
.
"I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow." -- genesis 48:22
.
Then Jacob summoned his sons and said, "Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what will befall you in the days to come. -- genesis 49:1
.
"Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob; And listen to Israel your father. -- genesis 49:2
.
"Reuben, you are my firstborn; My might and the beginning of my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. -- genesis 49:3
.
"Uncontrolled as water, you shall not have preeminence, Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled it--he went up to my couch. -- genesis 49:4
.
"Simeon and Levi are brothers; Their swords are implements of violence. -- genesis 49:5
.
"Let my soul not enter into their council; Let not my glory be united with their assembly; Because in their anger they slew men, And in their self-will they lamed oxen. -- genesis 49:6
.
"Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; And their wrath, for it is cruel. I will disperse them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel. -- genesis 49:7
.
"Judah, your brothers shall praise you; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons shall bow down to you. -- genesis 49:8
.
"Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him up? -- genesis 49:9
.
"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples. -- genesis 49:10
.
"He ties his foal to the vine, And his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes. -- genesis 49:11
.
"His eyes are dull from wine, And his teeth white from milk. -- genesis 49:12
.
"Zebulun will dwell at the seashore; And he shall be a haven for ships, And his flank shall be toward Sidon. -- genesis 49:13
.
"Issachar is a strong donkey, Lying down between the sheepfolds. -- genesis 49:14
.
"When he saw that a resting place was good And that the land was pleasant, He bowed his shoulder to bear burdens, And became a slave at forced labor. -- genesis 49:15
.
"Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel. -- genesis 49:16
.
"Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward. -- genesis 49:17
.
"For Your salvation I wait, O LORD. -- genesis 49:18
.
"As for Gad, raiders shall raid him, But he will raid at their heels. -- genesis 49:19
.
"As for Asher, his food shall be rich, And he will yield royal dainties. -- genesis 49:20
.
"Naphtali is a doe let loose, He gives beautiful words. -- genesis 49:21
.
"Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a spring; Its branches run over a wall. -- genesis 49:22
.
"The archers bitterly attacked him, And shot at him and harassed him; -- genesis 49:23
.
But his bow remained firm, And his arms were agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel), -- genesis 49:24
.
From the God of your father who helps you, And by the Almighty who blesses you With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. -- genesis 49:25
.
"The blessings of your father Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors Up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; May they be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers. -- genesis 49:26
.
"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he devours the prey, And in the evening he divides the spoil." -- genesis 49:27
.
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him. -- genesis 49:28
.
Then he charged them and said to them, "I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, -- genesis 49:29
.
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site. -- genesis 49:30
.
"There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah-- -- genesis 49:31
.
the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth." -- genesis 49:32
.
When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people. -- genesis 49:33
.
Then Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept over him and kissed him. -- genesis 50:1
.
Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. -- genesis 50:2
.
Now forty days were required for it, for such is the period required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days. -- genesis 50:3
.
When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please speak to Pharaoh, saying, -- genesis 50:4
.
'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am about to die; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me." Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.'" -- genesis 50:5
.
Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear." -- genesis 50:6
.
So Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt, -- genesis 50:7
.
and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father's household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen. -- genesis 50:8
.
There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company. -- genesis 50:9
.
When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he observed seven days mourning for his father. -- genesis 50:10
.
Now when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore it was named Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. -- genesis 50:11
.
Thus his sons did for him as he had charged them; -- genesis 50:12
.
for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite. -- genesis 50:13
.
After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him to bury his father. -- genesis 50:14
.
When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him!" -- genesis 50:15
.
So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father charged before he died, saying, -- genesis 50:16
.
'Thus you shall say to Joseph, "Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong."' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. -- genesis 50:17
.
Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants." -- genesis 50:18
.
But Joseph said to them, "Do not be afraid, for am I in God's place? -- genesis 50:19
.
"As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive. -- genesis 50:20
.
"So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones." So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them. -- genesis 50:21
.
Now Joseph stayed in Egypt, he and his father's household, and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. -- genesis 50:22
.
Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim's sons; also the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees. -- genesis 50:23
.
Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which He promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob." -- genesis 50:24
.
Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones up from here." -- genesis 50:25
.
So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt. -- genesis 50:26
.
Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; they came each one with his household: -- exodus 1:1
.
Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; -- exodus 1:2
.
Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; -- exodus 1:3
.
Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. -- exodus 1:4
.
All the persons who came from the loins of Jacob were seventy in number, but Joseph was already in Egypt. -- exodus 1:5
.
Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation. -- exodus 1:6
.
But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty, so that the land was filled with them. -- exodus 1:7
.
Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. -- exodus 1:8
.
He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we. -- exodus 1:9
.
"Come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply and in the event of war, they will also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us and depart from the land." -- exodus 1:10
.
So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses. -- exodus 1:11
.
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel. -- exodus 1:12
.
The Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously; -- exodus 1:13
.
and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all kinds of labor in the field, all their labors which they rigorously imposed on them. -- exodus 1:14
.
Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other was named Puah; -- exodus 1:15
.
and he said, "When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see them upon the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live." -- exodus 1:16
.
But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but let the boys live. -- exodus 1:17
.
So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?" -- exodus 1:18
.
The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them." -- exodus 1:19
.
So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty. -- exodus 1:20
.
Because the midwives feared God, He established households for them. -- exodus 1:21
.
Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born you are to cast into the Nile, and every daughter you are to keep alive." -- exodus 1:22
.
Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. -- exodus 2:1
.
The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months. -- exodus 2:2
.
But when she could hide him no longer, she got him a wicker basket and covered it over with tar and pitch. Then she put the child into it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. -- exodus 2:3
.
His sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him. -- exodus 2:4
.
The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her maidens walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid, and she brought it to her. -- exodus 2:5
.
When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the boy was crying. And she had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children." -- exodus 2:6
.
Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for you?" -- exodus 2:7
.
Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go ahead." So the girl went and called the child's mother. -- exodus 2:8
.
Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him. -- exodus 2:9
.
The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water." -- exodus 2:10
.
Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren. -- exodus 2:11
.
So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. -- exodus 2:12
.
He went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the offender, "Why are you striking your companion?" -- exodus 2:13
.
But he said, "Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and said, "Surely the matter has become known." -- exodus 2:14
.
When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. -- exodus 2:15
.
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. -- exodus 2:16
.
Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock. -- exodus 2:17
.
When they came to Reuel their father, he said, "Why have you come back so soon today?" -- exodus 2:18
.
So they said, "An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock." -- exodus 2:19
.
He said to his daughters, "Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat." -- exodus 2:20
.
Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses. -- exodus 2:21
.
Then she gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land." -- exodus 2:22
.
Now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of their bondage rose up to God. -- exodus 2:23
.
So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. -- exodus 2:24
.
God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice of them. -- exodus 2:25
.
Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. -- exodus 3:1
.
The angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed. -- exodus 3:2
.
So Moses said, "I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up." -- exodus 3:3
.
When the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am." -- exodus 3:4
.
Then He said, "Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground." -- exodus 3:5
.
He said also, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. -- exodus 3:6
.
The LORD said, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings. -- exodus 3:7
.
"So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. -- exodus 3:8
.
"Now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them. -- exodus 3:9
.
"Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt." -- exodus 3:10
.
But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?" -- exodus 3:11
.
And He said, "Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain." -- exodus 3:12
.
Then Moses said to God, "Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I will say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.' Now they may say to me, 'What is His name?' What shall I say to them?" -- exodus 3:13
.
God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM"; and He said, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'" -- exodus 3:14
.
God, furthermore, said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name to all generations. -- exodus 3:15
.
"Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt. -- exodus 3:16
.
"So I said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."' -- exodus 3:17
.
"They will pay heed to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt and you will say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.' -- exodus 3:18
.
"But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion. -- exodus 3:19
.
"So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go. -- exodus 3:20
.
"I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. -- exodus 3:21
.
"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the Egyptians." -- exodus 3:22
.
Then Moses said, "What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say? For they may say, 'The LORD has not appeared to you.'" -- exodus 4:1
.
The LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" And he said, "A staff." -- exodus 4:2
.
Then He said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. -- exodus 4:3
.
But the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand and grasp it by its tail"--so he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand-- -- exodus 4:4
.
"that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you." -- exodus 4:5
.
The LORD furthermore said to him, "Now put your hand into your bosom." So he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow. -- exodus 4:6
.
Then He said, "Put your hand into your bosom again." So he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh. -- exodus 4:7
.
"If they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe the witness of the last sign. -- exodus 4:8
.
"But if they will not believe even these two signs or heed what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground." -- exodus 4:9
.
Then Moses said to the LORD, "Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue." -- exodus 4:10
.
The LORD said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes him mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the LORD? -- exodus 4:11
.
"Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say." -- exodus 4:12
.
But he said, "Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever You will." -- exodus 4:13
.
Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, "Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. -- exodus 4:14
.
"You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I, even I, will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do. -- exodus 4:15
.
"Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; and he will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him. -- exodus 4:16
.
"You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs." -- exodus 4:17
.
Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace." -- exodus 4:18
.
Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead." -- exodus 4:19
.
So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand. -- exodus 4:20
.
The LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. -- exodus 4:21
.
"Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, "Israel is My son, My firstborn. -- exodus 4:22
.
"So I said to you, 'Let My son go that he may serve Me'; but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn."'" -- exodus 4:23
.
Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the LORD met him and sought to put him to death. -- exodus 4:24
.
Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and threw it at Moses' feet, and she said, "You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me." -- exodus 4:25
.
So He let him alone. At that time she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood"--because of the circumcision. -- exodus 4:26
.
Now the LORD said to Aaron, "Go to meet Moses in the wilderness." So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him. -- exodus 4:27
.
Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do. -- exodus 4:28
.
Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel; -- exodus 4:29
.
and Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses. He then performed the signs in the sight of the people. -- exodus 4:30
.
So the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD was concerned about the sons of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed low and worshiped. -- exodus 4:31
.
And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.'" -- exodus 5:1
.
But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and besides, I will not let Israel go." -- exodus 5:2
.
Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, otherwise He will fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword." -- exodus 5:3
.
But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your labors!" -- exodus 5:4
.
Again Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!" -- exodus 5:5
.
So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying, -- exodus 5:6
.
"You are no longer to give the people straw to make brick as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves. -- exodus 5:7
.
"But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.' -- exodus 5:8
.
"Let the labor be heavier on the men, and let them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words." -- exodus 5:9
.
So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I am not going to give you any straw. -- exodus 5:10
.
'You go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but none of your labor will be reduced.'" -- exodus 5:11
.
So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. -- exodus 5:12
.
The taskmasters pressed them, saying, "Complete your work quota, your daily amount, just as when you had straw." -- exodus 5:13
.
Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?" -- exodus 5:14
.
Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants? -- exodus 5:15
.
"There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your own people." -- exodus 5:16
.
But he said, "You are lazy, very lazy; therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.' -- exodus 5:17
.
"So go now and work; for you will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the quota of bricks." -- exodus 5:18
.
The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble because they were told, "You must not reduce your daily amount of bricks." -- exodus 5:19
.
When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them. -- exodus 5:20
.
They said to them, "May the LORD look upon you and judge you, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us." -- exodus 5:21
.
Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me? -- exodus 5:22
.
"Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all." -- exodus 5:23
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for under compulsion he will let them go, and under compulsion he will drive them out of his land." -- exodus 6:1
.
God spoke further to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD; -- exodus 6:2
.
and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name, LORD, I did not make Myself known to them. -- exodus 6:3
.
"I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they sojourned. -- exodus 6:4
.
"Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant. -- exodus 6:5
.
"Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. -- exodus 6:6
.
'Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. -- exodus 6:7
.
'I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you for a possession; I am the LORD.'" -- exodus 6:8
.
So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of their despondency and cruel bondage. -- exodus 6:9
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 6:10
.
"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the sons of Israel go out of his land." -- exodus 6:11
.
But Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, "Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled in speech?" -- exodus 6:12
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt. -- exodus 6:13
.
These are the heads of their fathers' households. The sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. -- exodus 6:14
.
The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. -- exodus 6:15
.
These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the length of Levi's life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. -- exodus 6:16
.
The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. -- exodus 6:17
.
The sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the length of Kohath's life was one hundred and thirty-three years. -- exodus 6:18
.
The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. -- exodus 6:19
.
Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram's life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. -- exodus 6:20
.
The sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri. -- exodus 6:21
.
The sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri. -- exodus 6:22
.
Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. -- exodus 6:23
.
The sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. -- exodus 6:24
.
Aaron's son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites according to their families. -- exodus 6:25
.
It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts." -- exodus 6:26
.
They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was the same Moses and Aaron. -- exodus 6:27
.
Now it came about on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, -- exodus 6:28
.
that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the LORD; speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you." -- exodus 6:29
.
But Moses said before the LORD, "Behold, I am unskilled in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?" -- exodus 6:30
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet. -- exodus 7:1
.
"You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land. -- exodus 7:2
.
"But I will harden Pharaoh's heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. -- exodus 7:3
.
"When Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments. -- exodus 7:4
.
"The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst." -- exodus 7:5
.
So Moses and Aaron did it; as the LORD commanded them, thus they did. -- exodus 7:6
.
Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh. -- exodus 7:7
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, -- exodus 7:8
.
"When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Work a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.'" -- exodus 7:9
.
So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent. -- exodus 7:10
.
Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts. -- exodus 7:11
.
For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs. -- exodus 7:12
.
Yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said. -- exodus 7:13
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go. -- exodus 7:14
.
"Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent. -- exodus 7:15
.
"You shall say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness. But behold, you have not listened until now." -- exodus 7:16
.
'Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it will be turned to blood. -- exodus 7:17
.
"The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul, and the Egyptians will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile."'" -- exodus 7:18
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood; and there will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'" -- exodus 7:19
.
So Moses and Aaron did even as the LORD had commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood. -- exodus 7:20
.
The fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. And the blood was through all the land of Egypt. -- exodus 7:21
.
But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said. -- exodus 7:22
.
Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this. -- exodus 7:23
.
So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the Nile. -- exodus 7:24
.
Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile. -- exodus 7:25
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me. -- exodus 8:1
.
"But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite your whole territory with frogs. -- exodus 8:2
.
"The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls. -- exodus 8:3
.
"So the frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants."'" -- exodus 8:4
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'" -- exodus 8:5
.
So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. -- exodus 8:6
.
The magicians did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Egypt. -- exodus 8:7
.
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Entreat the LORD that He remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD." -- exodus 8:8
.
Moses said to Pharaoh, "The honor is yours to tell me: when shall I entreat for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, that they may be left only in the Nile?" -- exodus 8:9
.
Then he said, "Tomorrow." So he said, "May it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God. -- exodus 8:10
.
"The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile." -- exodus 8:11
.
Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had inflicted upon Pharaoh. -- exodus 8:12
.
The LORD did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, the courts, and the fields. -- exodus 8:13
.
So they piled them in heaps, and the land became foul. -- exodus 8:14
.
But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as the LORD had said. -- exodus 8:15
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats through all the land of Egypt.'" -- exodus 8:16
.
They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Egypt. -- exodus 8:17
.
The magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; so there were gnats on man and beast. -- exodus 8:18
.
Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said. -- exodus 8:19
.
Now the LORD said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he comes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me. -- exodus 8:20
.
"For if you do not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they dwell. -- exodus 8:21
.
"But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of flies will be there, in order that you may know that I, the LORD, am in the midst of the land. -- exodus 8:22
.
"I will put a division between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will occur."'" -- exodus 8:23
.
Then the LORD did so. And there came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and the land was laid waste because of the swarms of flies in all the land of Egypt. -- exodus 8:24
.
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land." -- exodus 8:25
.
But Moses said, "It is not right to do so, for we will sacrifice to the LORD our God what is an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not then stone us? -- exodus 8:26
.
"We must go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us." -- exodus 8:27
.
Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make supplication for me." -- exodus 8:28
.
Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you, and I shall make supplication to the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully again in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD." -- exodus 8:29
.
So Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD. -- exodus 8:30
.
The LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people; not one remained. -- exodus 8:31
.
But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go. -- exodus 8:32
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and speak to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me. -- exodus 9:1
.
"For if you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them, -- exodus 9:2
.
behold, the hand of the LORD will come with a very severe pestilence on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks. -- exodus 9:3
.
"But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel."'" -- exodus 9:4
.
The LORD set a definite time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land." -- exodus 9:5
.
So the LORD did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the sons of Israel, not one died. -- exodus 9:6
.
Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. -- exodus 9:7
.
Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take for yourselves handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh. -- exodus 9:8
.
"It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Egypt." -- exodus 9:9
.
So they took soot from a kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast. -- exodus 9:10
.
The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians. -- exodus 9:11
.
And the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had spoken to Moses. -- exodus 9:12
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me. -- exodus 9:13
.
"For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth. -- exodus 9:14
.
"For if by now I had put forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would then have been cut off from the earth. -- exodus 9:15
.
"But, indeed, for this reason I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power and in order to proclaim My name through all the earth. -- exodus 9:16
.
"Still you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go. -- exodus 9:17
.
"Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. -- exodus 9:18
.
"Now therefore send, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die."'" -- exodus 9:19
.
The one among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses; -- exodus 9:20
.
but he who paid no regard to the word of the LORD left his servants and his livestock in the field. -- exodus 9:21
.
Now the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt." -- exodus 9:22
.
Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt. -- exodus 9:23
.
So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very severe, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. -- exodus 9:24
.
The hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; the hail also struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field. -- exodus 9:25
.
Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail. -- exodus 9:26
.
Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time; the LORD is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones. -- exodus 9:27
.
"Make supplication to the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer." -- exodus 9:28
.
Moses said to him, "As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease and there will be hail no longer, that you may know that the earth is the LORD'S. -- exodus 9:29
.
"But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God." -- exodus 9:30
.
(Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud. -- exodus 9:31
.
But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they ripen late.) -- exodus 9:32
.
So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to the LORD; and the thunder and the hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth. -- exodus 9:33
.
But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants. -- exodus 9:34
.
Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses. -- exodus 9:35
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may perform these signs of Mine among them, -- exodus 10:1
.
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and how I performed My signs among them, that you may know that I am the LORD." -- exodus 10:2
.
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me. -- exodus 10:3
.
'For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. -- exodus 10:4
.
'They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They will also eat the rest of what has escaped--what is left to you from the hail--and they will eat every tree which sprouts for you out of the field. -- exodus 10:5
.
'Then your houses shall be filled and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, something which neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day that they came upon the earth until this day.'" And he turned and went out from Pharaoh. -- exodus 10:6
.
Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?" -- exodus 10:7
.
So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve the LORD your God! Who are the ones that are going?" -- exodus 10:8
.
Moses said, "We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we shall go, for we must hold a feast to the LORD." -- exodus 10:9
.
Then he said to them, "Thus may the LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Take heed, for evil is in your mind. -- exodus 10:10
.
"Not so! Go now, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you desire." So they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. -- exodus 10:11
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat every plant of the land, even all that the hail has left." -- exodus 10:12
.
So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD directed an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. -- exodus 10:13
.
The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt; they were very numerous. There had never been so many locusts, nor would there be so many again. -- exodus 10:14
.
For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Thus nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field through all the land of Egypt. -- exodus 10:15
.
Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron, and he said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. -- exodus 10:16
.
"Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and make supplication to the LORD your God, that He would only remove this death from me." -- exodus 10:17
.
He went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD. -- exodus 10:18
.
So the LORD shifted the wind to a very strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt. -- exodus 10:19
.
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go. -- exodus 10:20
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt." -- exodus 10:21
.
So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. -- exodus 10:22
.
They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings. -- exodus 10:23
.
Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be detained. Even your little ones may go with you." -- exodus 10:24
.
But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice them to the LORD our God. -- exodus 10:25
.
"Therefore, our livestock too shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the LORD our God. And until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve the LORD." -- exodus 10:26
.
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go. -- exodus 10:27
.
Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Beware, do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die!" -- exodus 10:28
.
Moses said, "You are right; I shall never see your face again!" -- exodus 10:29
.
Now the LORD said to Moses, "One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely. -- exodus 11:1
.
"Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold." -- exodus 11:2
.
The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Furthermore, the man Moses himself was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt, both in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people. -- exodus 11:3
.
Moses said, "Thus says the LORD, 'About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt, -- exodus 11:4
.
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; all the firstborn of the cattle as well. -- exodus 11:5
.
'Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been before and such as shall never be again. -- exodus 11:6
.
'But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even bark, whether against man or beast, that you may understand how the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.' -- exodus 11:7
.
"All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, 'Go out, you and all the people who follow you,' and after that I will go out." And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger. -- exodus 11:8
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Egypt." -- exodus 11:9
.
Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land. -- exodus 11:10
.
Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, -- exodus 12:1
.
"This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year to you. -- exodus 12:2
.
"Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers' households, a lamb for each household. -- exodus 12:3
.
'Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons in them; according to what each man should eat, you are to divide the lamb. -- exodus 12:4
.
'Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. -- exodus 12:5
.
'You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight. -- exodus 12:6
.
'Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. -- exodus 12:7
.
'They shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. -- exodus 12:8
.
'Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, both its head and its legs along with its entrails. -- exodus 12:9
.
'And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire. -- exodus 12:10
.
'Now you shall eat it in this manner: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste--it is the LORD'S Passover. -- exodus 12:11
.
'For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments--I am the LORD. -- exodus 12:12
.
'The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. -- exodus 12:13
.
'Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance. -- exodus 12:14
.
'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel. -- exodus 12:15
.
'On the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone may be prepared by you. -- exodus 12:16
.
'You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance. -- exodus 12:17
.
'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening. -- exodus 12:18
.
'Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is an alien or a native of the land. -- exodus 12:19
.
'You shall not eat anything leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.'" -- exodus 12:20
.
Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slay the Passover lamb. -- exodus 12:21
.
"You shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning. -- exodus 12:22
.
"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you. -- exodus 12:23
.
"And you shall observe this event as an ordinance for you and your children forever. -- exodus 12:24
.
"When you enter the land which the LORD will give you, as He has promised, you shall observe this rite. -- exodus 12:25
.
"And when your children say to you, 'What does this rite mean to you?' -- exodus 12:26
.
you shall say, 'It is a Passover sacrifice to the LORD who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians, but spared our homes.'" And the people bowed low and worshiped. -- exodus 12:27
.
Then the sons of Israel went and did so; just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did. -- exodus 12:28
.
Now it came about at midnight that the LORD struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle. -- exodus 12:29
.
Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead. -- exodus 12:30
.
Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, worship the LORD, as you have said. -- exodus 12:31
.
"Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also." -- exodus 12:32
.
The Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We will all be dead." -- exodus 12:33
.
So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders. -- exodus 12:34
.
Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; -- exodus 12:35
.
and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request. Thus they plundered the Egyptians. -- exodus 12:36
.
Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children. -- exodus 12:37
.
A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock. -- exodus 12:38
.
They baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves. -- exodus 12:39
.
Now the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. -- exodus 12:40
.
And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. -- exodus 12:41
.
It is a night to be observed for the LORD for having brought them out from the land of Egypt; this night is for the LORD, to be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations. -- exodus 12:42
.
The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat of it; -- exodus 12:43
.
but every man's slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it. -- exodus 12:44
.
"A sojourner or a hired servant shall not eat of it. -- exodus 12:45
.
"It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it. -- exodus 12:46
.
"All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this. -- exodus 12:47
.
"But if a stranger sojourns with you, and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat of it. -- exodus 12:48
.
"The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who sojourns among you." -- exodus 12:49
.
Then all the sons of Israel did so; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. -- exodus 12:50
.
And on that same day the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts. -- exodus 12:51
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 13:1
.
"Sanctify to Me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me." -- exodus 13:2
.
Moses said to the people, "Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place. And nothing leavened shall be eaten. -- exodus 13:3
.
"On this day in the month of Abib, you are about to go forth. -- exodus 13:4
.
"It shall be when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall observe this rite in this month. -- exodus 13:5
.
"For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD. -- exodus 13:6
.
"Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your borders. -- exodus 13:7
.
"You shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.' -- exodus 13:8
.
"And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a powerful hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt. -- exodus 13:9
.
"Therefore, you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year. -- exodus 13:10
.
"Now when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you, -- exodus 13:11
.
you shall devote to the LORD the first offspring of every womb, and the first offspring of every beast that you own; the males belong to the LORD. -- exodus 13:12
.
"But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem. -- exodus 13:13
.
"And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' then you shall say to him, 'With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery. -- exodus 13:14
.
'It came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD the males, the first offspring of every womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.' -- exodus 13:15
.
"So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt." -- exodus 13:16
.
Now when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for God said, "The people might change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt." -- exodus 13:17
.
Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt. -- exodus 13:18
.
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, "God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones from here with you." -- exodus 13:19
.
Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness. -- exodus 13:20
.
The LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night. -- exodus 13:21
.
He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people. -- exodus 13:22
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 14:1
.
"Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea. -- exodus 14:2
.
"For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, 'They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.' -- exodus 14:3
.
"Thus I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." And they did so. -- exodus 14:4
.
When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?" -- exodus 14:5
.
So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him; -- exodus 14:6
.
and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them. -- exodus 14:7
.
The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he chased after the sons of Israel as the sons of Israel were going out boldly. -- exodus 14:8
.
Then the Egyptians chased after them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon. -- exodus 14:9
.
As Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD. -- exodus 14:10
.
Then they said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt? -- exodus 14:11
.
"Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness." -- exodus 14:12
.
But Moses said to the people, "Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever. -- exodus 14:13
.
"The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent." -- exodus 14:14
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward. -- exodus 14:15
.
"As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land. -- exodus 14:16
.
"As for Me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. -- exodus 14:17
.
"Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen." -- exodus 14:18
.
The angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them. -- exodus 14:19
.
So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night. -- exodus 14:20
.
Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD swept the sea back by a strong east wind all night and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided. -- exodus 14:21
.
The sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. -- exodus 14:22
.
Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea. -- exodus 14:23
.
At the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion. -- exodus 14:24
.
He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians." -- exodus 14:25
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen." -- exodus 14:26
.
So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. -- exodus 14:27
.
The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh's entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained. -- exodus 14:28
.
But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. -- exodus 14:29
.
Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. -- exodus 14:30
.
When Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses. -- exodus 14:31
.
Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and said, "I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea. -- exodus 15:1
.
"The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; This is my God, and I will praise Him; My father's God, and I will extol Him. -- exodus 15:2
.
"The LORD is a warrior; The LORD is His name. -- exodus 15:3
.
"Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea. -- exodus 15:4
.
"The deeps cover them; They went down into the depths like a stone. -- exodus 15:5
.
"Your right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power, Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy. -- exodus 15:6
.
"And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You; You send forth Your burning anger, and it consumes them as chaff. -- exodus 15:7
.
"At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up, The flowing waters stood up like a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. -- exodus 15:8
.
"The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be gratified against them; I will draw out my sword, my hand will destroy them.' -- exodus 15:9
.
"You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters. -- exodus 15:10
.
"Who is like You among the gods, O LORD? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, Awesome in praises, working wonders? -- exodus 15:11
.
"You stretched out Your right hand, The earth swallowed them. -- exodus 15:12
.
"In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed; In Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation. -- exodus 15:13
.
"The peoples have heard, they tremble; Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia. -- exodus 15:14
.
"Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them; All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away. -- exodus 15:15
.
"Terror and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone; Until Your people pass over, O LORD, Until the people pass over whom You have purchased. -- exodus 15:16
.
"You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, The place, O LORD, which You have made for Your dwelling, The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established. -- exodus 15:17
.
"The LORD shall reign forever and ever." -- exodus 15:18
.
For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea on them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea. -- exodus 15:19
.
Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing. -- exodus 15:20
.
Miriam answered them, "Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea." -- exodus 15:21
.
Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water. -- exodus 15:22
.
When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah. -- exodus 15:23
.
So the people grumbled at Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?" -- exodus 15:24
.
Then he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree; and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There He made for them a statute and regulation, and there He tested them. -- exodus 15:25
.
And He said, "If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer." -- exodus 15:26
.
Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters. -- exodus 15:27
.
Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt. -- exodus 16:1
.
The whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. -- exodus 16:2
.
The sons of Israel said to them, "Would that we had died by the LORD'S hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger." -- exodus 16:3
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My instruction. -- exodus 16:4
.
"On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily." -- exodus 16:5
.
So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, "At evening you will know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt; -- exodus 16:6
.
and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, for He hears your grumblings against the LORD; and what are we, that you grumble against us?" -- exodus 16:7
.
Moses said, "This will happen when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for the LORD hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him. And what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD." -- exodus 16:8
.
Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, 'Come near before the LORD, for He has heard your grumblings.'" -- exodus 16:9
.
It came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. -- exodus 16:10
.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 16:11
.
"I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'" -- exodus 16:12
.
So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. -- exodus 16:13
.
When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground. -- exodus 16:14
.
When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, "It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat. -- exodus 16:15
.
"This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Gather of it every man as much as he should eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent.'" -- exodus 16:16
.
The sons of Israel did so, and some gathered much and some little. -- exodus 16:17
.
When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered as much as he should eat. -- exodus 16:18
.
Moses said to them, "Let no man leave any of it until morning." -- exodus 16:19
.
But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them. -- exodus 16:20
.
They gathered it morning by morning, every man as much as he should eat; but when the sun grew hot, it would melt. -- exodus 16:21
.
Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, -- exodus 16:22
.
then he said to them, "This is what the LORD meant: Tomorrow is a sabbath observance, a holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning." -- exodus 16:23
.
So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not become foul nor was there any worm in it. -- exodus 16:24
.
Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field. -- exodus 16:25
.
"Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, there will be none." -- exodus 16:26
.
It came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. -- exodus 16:27
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions? -- exodus 16:28
.
"See, the LORD has given you the sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Remain every man in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day." -- exodus 16:29
.
So the people rested on the seventh day. -- exodus 16:30
.
The house of Israel named it manna, and it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like wafers with honey. -- exodus 16:31
.
Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'" -- exodus 16:32
.
Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations." -- exodus 16:33
.
As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony, to be kept. -- exodus 16:34
.
The sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. -- exodus 16:35
.
(Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.) -- exodus 16:36
.
Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin, according to the command of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink. -- exodus 17:1
.
Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water that we may drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?" -- exodus 17:2
.
But the people thirsted there for water; and they grumbled against Moses and said, "Why, now, have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?" -- exodus 17:3
.
So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "What shall I do to this people? A little more and they will stone me." -- exodus 17:4
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. -- exodus 17:5
.
"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. -- exodus 17:6
.
He named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the LORD, saying, "Is the LORD among us, or not?" -- exodus 17:7
.
Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim. -- exodus 17:8
.
So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand." -- exodus 17:9
.
Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought against Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. -- exodus 17:10
.
So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed. -- exodus 17:11
.
But Moses' hands were heavy. Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set. -- exodus 17:12
.
So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. -- exodus 17:13
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven." -- exodus 17:14
.
Moses built an altar and named it The LORD is My Banner; -- exodus 17:15
.
and he said, "The LORD has sworn; the LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation." -- exodus 17:16
.
Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. -- exodus 18:1
.
Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Moses' wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away, -- exodus 18:2
.
and her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, for Moses said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land." -- exodus 18:3
.
The other was named Eliezer, for he said, "The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh." -- exodus 18:4
.
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mount of God. -- exodus 18:5
.
He sent word to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her." -- exodus 18:6
.
Then Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent. -- exodus 18:7
.
Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had befallen them on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them. -- exodus 18:8
.
Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians. -- exodus 18:9
.
So Jethro said, "Blessed be the LORD who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. -- exodus 18:10
.
"Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods; indeed, it was proven when they dealt proudly against the people." -- exodus 18:11
.
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law before God. -- exodus 18:12
.
It came about the next day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning until the evening. -- exodus 18:13
.
Now when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?" -- exodus 18:14
.
Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God. -- exodus 18:15
.
"When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and make known the statutes of God and His laws." -- exodus 18:16
.
Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you are doing is not good. -- exodus 18:17
.
"You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone. -- exodus 18:18
.
"Now listen to me: I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You be the people's representative before God, and you bring the disputes to God, -- exodus 18:19
.
then teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk and the work they are to do. -- exodus 18:20
.
"Furthermore, you shall select out of all the people able men who fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; and you shall place these over them as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens. -- exodus 18:21
.
"Let them judge the people at all times; and let it be that every major dispute they will bring to you, but every minor dispute they themselves will judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. -- exodus 18:22
.
"If you do this thing and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace." -- exodus 18:23
.
So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. -- exodus 18:24
.
Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens. -- exodus 18:25
.
They judged the people at all times; the difficult dispute they would bring to Moses, but every minor dispute they themselves would judge. -- exodus 18:26
.
Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way into his own land. -- exodus 18:27
.
In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. -- exodus 19:1
.
When they set out from Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped in front of the mountain. -- exodus 19:2
.
Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel: -- exodus 19:3
.
'You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to Myself. -- exodus 19:4
.
'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; -- exodus 19:5
.
and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel." -- exodus 19:6
.
So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him. -- exodus 19:7
.
All the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do!" And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD. -- exodus 19:8
.
The LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may also believe in you forever." Then Moses told the words of the people to the LORD. -- exodus 19:9
.
The LORD also said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments; -- exodus 19:10
.
and let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. -- exodus 19:11
.
"You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, 'Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. -- exodus 19:12
.
'No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain." -- exodus 19:13
.
So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people, and they washed their garments. -- exodus 19:14
.
He said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman." -- exodus 19:15
.
So it came about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. -- exodus 19:16
.
And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. -- exodus 19:17
.
Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently. -- exodus 19:18
.
When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder. -- exodus 19:19
.
The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. -- exodus 19:20
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, so that they do not break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. -- exodus 19:21
.
"Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, or else the LORD will break out against them." -- exodus 19:22
.
Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You warned us, saying, 'Set bounds about the mountain and consecrate it.'" -- exodus 19:23
.
Then the LORD said to him, "Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, or He will break forth upon them." -- exodus 19:24
.
So Moses went down to the people and told them. -- exodus 19:25
.
Then God spoke all these words, saying, -- exodus 20:1
.
"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. -- exodus 20:2
.
"You shall have no other gods before Me. -- exodus 20:3
.
"You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. -- exodus 20:4
.
"You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, -- exodus 20:5
.
but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. -- exodus 20:6
.
"You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain. -- exodus 20:7
.
"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. -- exodus 20:8
.
"Six days you shall labor and do all your work, -- exodus 20:9
.
but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. -- exodus 20:10
.
"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy. -- exodus 20:11
.
"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you. -- exodus 20:12
.
"You shall not murder. -- exodus 20:13
.
"You shall not commit adultery. -- exodus 20:14
.
"You shall not steal. -- exodus 20:15
.
"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. -- exodus 20:16
.
"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor." -- exodus 20:17
.
All the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance. -- exodus 20:18
.
Then they said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not God speak to us, or we will die." -- exodus 20:19
.
Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin." -- exodus 20:20
.
So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was. -- exodus 20:21
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven. -- exodus 20:22
.
'You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves. -- exodus 20:23
.
'You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you. -- exodus 20:24
.
'If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it. -- exodus 20:25
.
'And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.' -- exodus 20:26
.
"Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them: -- exodus 21:1
.
"If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment. -- exodus 21:2
.
"If he comes alone, he shall go out alone; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him. -- exodus 21:3
.
"If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone. -- exodus 21:4
.
"But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not go out as a free man,' -- exodus 21:5
.
then his master shall bring him to God, then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him permanently. -- exodus 21:6
.
"If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she is not to go free as the male slaves do. -- exodus 21:7
.
"If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his unfairness to her. -- exodus 21:8
.
"If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters. -- exodus 21:9
.
"If he takes to himself another woman, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights. -- exodus 21:10
.
"If he will not do these three things for her, then she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money. -- exodus 21:11
.
"He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death. -- exodus 21:12
.
"But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee. -- exodus 21:13
.
"If, however, a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor, so as to kill him craftily, you are to take him even from My altar, that he may die. -- exodus 21:14
.
"He who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. -- exodus 21:15
.
"He who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death. -- exodus 21:16
.
"He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. -- exodus 21:17
.
"If men have a quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but remains in bed, -- exodus 21:18
.
if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall go unpunished; he shall only pay for his loss of time, and shall take care of him until he is completely healed. -- exodus 21:19
.
"If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished. -- exodus 21:20
.
"If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property. -- exodus 21:21
.
"If men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely, yet there is no injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges decide. -- exodus 21:22
.
"But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life, -- exodus 21:23
.
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, -- exodus 21:24
.
burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. -- exodus 21:25
.
"If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave, and destroys it, he shall let him go free on account of his eye. -- exodus 21:26
.
"And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth. -- exodus 21:27
.
"If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished. -- exodus 21:28
.
"If, however, an ox was previously in the habit of goring and its owner has been warned, yet he does not confine it and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death. -- exodus 21:29
.
"If a ransom is demanded of him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded of him. -- exodus 21:30
.
"Whether it gores a son or a daughter, it shall be done to him according to the same rule. -- exodus 21:31
.
"If the ox gores a male or female slave, the owner shall give his or her master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. -- exodus 21:32
.
"If a man opens a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it over, and an ox or a donkey falls into it, -- exodus 21:33
.
the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall become his. -- exodus 21:34
.
"If one man's ox hurts another's so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally; and also they shall divide the dead ox. -- exodus 21:35
.
"Or if it is known that the ox was previously in the habit of goring, yet its owner has not confined it, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal shall become his. -- exodus 21:36
.
"If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox and four sheep for the sheep. -- exodus 22:1
.
"If the thief is caught while breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguiltiness on his account. -- exodus 22:2
.
"But if the sun has risen on him, there will be bloodguiltiness on his account. He shall surely make restitution; if he owns nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. -- exodus 22:3
.
"If what he stole is actually found alive in his possession, whether an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double. -- exodus 22:4
.
"If a man lets a field or vineyard be grazed bare and lets his animal loose so that it grazes in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard. -- exodus 22:5
.
"If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, so that stacked grain or the standing grain or the field itself is consumed, he who started the fire shall surely make restitution. -- exodus 22:6
.
"If a man gives his neighbor money or goods to keep for him and it is stolen from the man's house, if the thief is caught, he shall pay double. -- exodus 22:7
.
"If the thief is not caught, then the owner of the house shall appear before the judges, to determine whether he laid his hands on his neighbor's property. -- exodus 22:8
.
"For every breach of trust, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any lost thing about which one says, 'This is it,' the case of both parties shall come before the judges; he whom the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor. -- exodus 22:9
.
"If a man gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep for him, and it dies or is hurt or is driven away while no one is looking, -- exodus 22:10
.
an oath before the LORD shall be made by the two of them that he has not laid hands on his neighbor's property; and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. -- exodus 22:11
.

.
"If its owner is with it, he shall not make restitution; if it is hired, it came for its hire. -- exodus 22:15
.
"If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, and lies with her, he must pay a dowry for her to be his wife. -- exodus 22:16

.

.
for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his body. What else shall he sleep in? And it shall come about that when he cries out to Me, I will hear him, for I am gracious. -- exodus 22:27
.
"You shall not curse God, nor curse a ruler of your people. -- exodus 22:28

.
"But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. -- exodus 23:22
.
"For My angel will go before you and bring you in to the land of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will completely destroy them. -- exodus 23:23
.
"You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their deeds; but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their sacred pillars in pieces. -- exodus 23:24
.
"But you shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will remove sickness from your midst. -- exodus 23:25
.
"There shall be no one miscarrying or barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days. -- exodus 23:26
.
"I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you. -- exodus 23:27
.
"I will send hornets ahead of you so that they will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites before you. -- exodus 23:28
.
"I will not drive them out before you in a single year, that the land may not become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you. -- exodus 23:29
.
"I will drive them out before you little by little, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land. -- exodus 23:30
.
"I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River Euphrates; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you. -- exodus 23:31
.
"You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods. -- exodus 23:32
.
"They shall not live in your land, because they will make you sin against Me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you." -- exodus 23:33
.
Then He said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship at a distance. -- exodus 24:1
.
"Moses alone, however, shall come near to the LORD, but they shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him." -- exodus 24:2
.
Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the LORD and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice and said, "All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do!" -- exodus 24:3
.
Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Then he arose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. -- exodus 24:4
.
He sent young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD. -- exodus 24:5
.
Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and the other half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. -- exodus 24:6
.
Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!" -- exodus 24:7
.
So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words." -- exodus 24:8
.
Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, -- exodus 24:9
.
and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself. -- exodus 24:10
.
Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they saw God, and they ate and drank. -- exodus 24:11
.
Now the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction." -- exodus 24:12
.
So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God. -- exodus 24:13
.
But to the elders he said, "Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him approach them." -- exodus 24:14
.
Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. -- exodus 24:15
.
The glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. -- exodus 24:16
.
And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountain top. -- exodus 24:17
.
Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights. -- exodus 24:18
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 25:1
.
"Tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution for Me; from every man whose heart moves him you shall raise My contribution. -- exodus 25:2
.
"This is the contribution which you are to raise from them: gold, silver and bronze, -- exodus 25:3
.
blue, purple and scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, -- exodus 25:4
.
rams' skins dyed red, porpoise skins, acacia wood, -- exodus 25:5
.
oil for lighting, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, -- exodus 25:6
.
onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastpiece. -- exodus 25:7
.
"Let them construct a sanctuary for Me, that I may dwell among them. -- exodus 25:8
.
"According to all that I am going to show you, as the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture, just so you shall construct it. -- exodus 25:9
.
"They shall construct an ark of acacia wood two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high. -- exodus 25:10
.
"You shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and out you shall overlay it, and you shall make a gold molding around it. -- exodus 25:11
.
"You shall cast four gold rings for it and fasten them on its four feet, and two rings shall be on one side of it and two rings on the other side of it. -- exodus 25:12
.
"You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. -- exodus 25:13
.
"You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark with them. -- exodus 25:14
.
"The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it. -- exodus 25:15
.
"You shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you. -- exodus 25:16
.
"You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. -- exodus 25:17
.
"You shall make two cherubim of gold, make them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat. -- exodus 25:18
.
"Make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; you shall make the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its two ends. -- exodus 25:19
.
"The cherubim shall have their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings and facing one another; the faces of the cherubim are to be turned toward the mercy seat. -- exodus 25:20
.
"You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I will give to you. -- exodus 25:21
.
"There I will meet with you; and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak to you about all that I will give you in commandment for the sons of Israel. -- exodus 25:22
.

"Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it; -- exodus 30:19
.
when they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, so that they will not die; or when they approach the altar to minister, by offering up in smoke a fire sacrifice to the LORD. -- exodus 30:20
.
"So they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they will not die; and it shall be a perpetual statute for them, for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations." -- exodus 30:21
.
Moreover, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 30:22
.
"Take also for yourself the finest of spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred and fifty, and of fragrant cane two hundred and fifty, -- exodus 30:23
.
and of cassia five hundred, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin. -- exodus 30:24
.
"You shall make of these a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil. -- exodus 30:25
.
"With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony, -- exodus 30:26
.
and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense, -- exodus 30:27
.
and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand. -- exodus 30:28
.
"You shall also consecrate them, that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy. -- exodus 30:29
.
"You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister as priests to Me. -- exodus 30:30
.
"You shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations. -- exodus 30:31
.
'It shall not be poured on anyone's body, nor shall you make any like it in the same proportions; it is holy, and it shall be holy to you. -- exodus 30:32
.
'Whoever shall mix any like it or whoever puts any of it on a layman shall be cut off from his people.'" -- exodus 30:33
.
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take for yourself spices, stacte and onycha and galbanum, spices with pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each. -- exodus 30:34
.
"With it you shall make incense, a perfume, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, and holy. -- exodus 30:35
.
"You shall beat some of it very fine, and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you; it shall be most holy to you. -- exodus 30:36
.
"The incense which you shall make, you shall not make in the same proportions for yourselves; it shall be holy to you for the LORD. -- exodus 30:37
.
"Whoever shall make any like it, to use as perfume, shall be cut off from his people." -- exodus 30:38
.
Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 31:1
.
"See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. -- exodus 31:2
.
"I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship, -- exodus 31:3
.
to make artistic designs for work in gold, in silver, and in bronze, -- exodus 31:4
.
and in the cutting of stones for settings, and in the carving of wood, that he may work in all kinds of craftsmanship. -- exodus 31:5
.
"And behold, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are skillful I have put skill, that they may make all that I have commanded you: -- exodus 31:6
.
the tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy seat upon it, and all the furniture of the tent, -- exodus 31:7
.
the table also and its utensils, and the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense, -- exodus 31:8
.
the altar of burnt offering also with all its utensils, and the laver and its stand, -- exodus 31:9
.
the woven garments as well, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, with which to carry on their priesthood; -- exodus 31:10
.
the anointing oil also, and the fragrant incense for the holy place, they are to make them according to all that I have commanded you." -- exodus 31:11
.
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, -- exodus 31:12
.
"But as for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'You shall surely observe My sabbaths; for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you. -- exodus 31:13
.
'Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people. -- exodus 31:14
.
'For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put to death. -- exodus 31:15
.
'So the sons of Israel shall observe the sabbath, to celebrate the sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.' -- exodus 31:16
.
"It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, but on the seventh day He ceased from labor, and was refreshed." -- exodus 31:17
.
When He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God. -- exodus 31:18
.
Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people assembled about Aaron and said to him, "Come, make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him." -- exodus 32:1
.
Aaron said to them, "Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me." -- exodus 32:2
.
Then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. -- exodus 32:3
.
He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, "This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt." -- exodus 32:4
.
Now when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD." -- exodus 32:5
.
So the next day they rose early and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. -- exodus 32:6
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. -- exodus 32:7
.
"They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!'" -- exodus 32:8
.
The LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and behold, they are an obstinate people. -- exodus 32:9
.
"Now then let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation." -- exodus 32:10
.
Then Moses entreated the LORD his God, and said, "O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? -- exodus 32:11
.
"Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth'? Turn from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your people. -- exodus 32:12
.
"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.'" -- exodus 32:13
.
So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people. -- exodus 32:14
.
Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides; they were written on one side and the other. -- exodus 32:15
.
The tablets were God's work, and the writing was God's writing engraved on the tablets. -- exodus 32:16
.
Now when Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a sound of war in the camp." -- exodus 32:17
.
But he said, "It is not the sound of the cry of triumph, Nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat; But the sound of singing I hear." -- exodus 32:18
.
It came about, as soon as Moses came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses' anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain. -- exodus 32:19
.
He took the calf which they had made and burned it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it over the surface of the water and made the sons of Israel drink it. -- exodus 32:20
.
Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such great sin upon them?" -- exodus 32:21
.
Aaron said, "Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil. -- exodus 32:22
.
"For they said to me, 'Make a god for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.' -- exodus 32:23
.
"I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf." -- exodus 32:24
.
Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control--for Aaron had let them get out of control to be a derision among their enemies-- -- exodus 32:25
.
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me!" And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him. -- exodus 32:26
.
He said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Every man of you put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.'" -- exodus 32:27
.
So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day. -- exodus 32:28
.
Then Moses said, "Dedicate yourselves today to the LORD--for every man has been against his son and against his brother--in order that He may bestow a blessing upon you today." -- exodus 32:29
.
On the next day Moses said to the people, "You yourselves have committed a great sin; and now I am going up to the LORD, perhaps I can make atonement for your sin." -- exodus 32:30
.
Then Moses returned to the LORD, and said, "Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made a god of gold for themselves. -- exodus 32:31
.
"But now, if You will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out from Your book which You have written!" -- exodus 32:32
.
The LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book. -- exodus 32:33
.
"But go now, lead the people where I told you. Behold, My angel shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin." -- exodus 32:34
.
Then the LORD smote the people, because of what they did with the calf which Aaron had made. -- exodus 32:35
.
Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your descendants I will give it.' -- exodus 33:1
.
"I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. -- exodus 33:2
.
"Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, because you are an obstinate people, and I might destroy you on the way." -- exodus 33:3
.
When the people heard this sad word, they went into mourning, and none of them put on his ornaments. -- exodus 33:4
.
For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the sons of Israel, 'You are an obstinate people; should I go up in your midst for one moment, I would destroy you. Now therefore, put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what I shall do with you.'" -- exodus 33:5
.
So the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward. -- exodus 33:6
.
Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp. -- exodus 33:7
.
And it came about, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses until he entered the tent. -- exodus 33:8
.
Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent; and the LORD would speak with Moses. -- exodus 33:9
.
When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would arise and worship, each at the entrance of his tent. -- exodus 33:10
.
Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses returned to the camp, his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent. -- exodus 33:11
.
Then Moses said to the LORD, "See, You say to me, 'Bring up this people!' But You Yourself have not let me know whom You will send with me. Moreover, You have said, 'I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.' -- exodus 33:12
.
"Now therefore, I pray You, if I have found favor in Your sight, let me know Your ways that I may know You, so that I may find favor in Your sight. Consider too, that this nation is Your people." -- exodus 33:13
.
And He said, "My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest." -- exodus 33:14
.
Then he said to Him, "If Your presence does not go with us, do not lead us up from here. -- exodus 33:15
.
"For how then can it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, may be distinguished from all the other people who are upon the face of the earth?" -- exodus 33:16
.
The LORD said to Moses, "I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight and I have known you by name." -- exodus 33:17
.
Then Moses said, "I pray You, show me Your glory!" -- exodus 33:18
.
And He said, "I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion." -- exodus 33:19
.
But He said, "You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!" -- exodus 33:20
.
Then the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand there on the rock; -- exodus 33:21
.
and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by. -- exodus 33:22
.
"Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen." -- exodus 33:23
.
Now the LORD said to Moses, "Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered. -- exodus 34:1
.
"So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain. -- exodus 34:2
.
"No man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain." -- exodus 34:3
.
