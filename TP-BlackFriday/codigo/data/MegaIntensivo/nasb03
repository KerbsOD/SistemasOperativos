Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. -- 1 samuel 13:15
.
Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people who were present with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash. -- 1 samuel 13:16
.
And the raiders came from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, -- 1 samuel 13:17
.
and another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border which overlooks the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. -- 1 samuel 13:18
.
Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears." -- 1 samuel 13:19
.
So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his hoe. -- 1 samuel 13:20
.
The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to fix the hoes. -- 1 samuel 13:21
.
So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, but they were found with Saul and his son Jonathan. -- 1 samuel 13:22
.
And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash. -- 1 samuel 13:23
.
Now the day came that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was carrying his armor, "Come and let us cross over to the Philistines' garrison that is on the other side." But he did not tell his father. -- 1 samuel 14:1
.
Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron. And the people who were with him were about six hundred men, -- 1 samuel 14:2
.
and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the LORD at Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. -- 1 samuel 14:3
.
Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp crag on the one side and a sharp crag on the other side, and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. -- 1 samuel 14:4
.
The one crag rose on the north opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba. -- 1 samuel 14:5
.
Then Jonathan said to the young man who was carrying his armor, "Come and let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; perhaps the LORD will work for us, for the LORD is not restrained to save by many or by few." -- 1 samuel 14:6
.
His armor bearer said to him, "Do all that is in your heart; turn yourself, and here I am with you according to your desire." -- 1 samuel 14:7
.
Then Jonathan said, "Behold, we will cross over to the men and reveal ourselves to them. -- 1 samuel 14:8
.
"If they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you'; then we will stand in our place and not go up to them. -- 1 samuel 14:9
.
"But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hands; and this shall be the sign to us." -- 1 samuel 14:10
.
When both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, "Behold, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves." -- 1 samuel 14:11
.
So the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor bearer and said, "Come up to us and we will tell you something." And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hands of Israel." -- 1 samuel 14:12
.
Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer behind him; and they fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer put some to death after him. -- 1 samuel 14:13
.
That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about twenty men within about half a furrow in an acre of land. -- 1 samuel 14:14
.
And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even the garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked so that it became a great trembling. -- 1 samuel 14:15
.
Now Saul's watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away; and they went here and there. -- 1 samuel 14:16
.
Saul said to the people who were with him, "Number now and see who has gone from us." And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there. -- 1 samuel 14:17
.
Then Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God here." For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel. -- 1 samuel 14:18
.
While Saul talked to the priest, the commotion in the camp of the Philistines continued and increased; so Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand." -- 1 samuel 14:19
.
Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and came to the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. -- 1 samuel 14:20
.
Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. -- 1 samuel 14:21
.
When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, even they also pursued them closely in the battle. -- 1 samuel 14:22
.
So the LORD delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread beyond Beth-aven. -- 1 samuel 14:23
.
Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul had put the people under oath, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and until I have avenged myself on my enemies." So none of the people tasted food. -- 1 samuel 14:24
.
All the people of the land entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground. -- 1 samuel 14:25
.
When the people entered the forest, behold, there was a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. -- 1 samuel 14:26
.
But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under oath; therefore, he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened. -- 1 samuel 14:27
.
Then one of the people said, "Your father strictly put the people under oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food today.'" And the people were weary. -- 1 samuel 14:28
.
Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. See now, how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. -- 1 samuel 14:29
.
"How much more, if only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great." -- 1 samuel 14:30
.
They struck among the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very weary. -- 1 samuel 14:31
.
The people rushed greedily upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood. -- 1 samuel 14:32
.
Then they told Saul, saying, "Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have acted treacherously; roll a great stone to me today." -- 1 samuel 14:33
.
Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, 'Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and slaughter it here and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So all the people that night brought each one his ox with him and slaughtered it there. -- 1 samuel 14:34
.
And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD. -- 1 samuel 14:35
.
Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them." And they said, "Do whatever seems good to you." So the priest said, "Let us draw near to God here." -- 1 samuel 14:36
.
Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?" But He did not answer him on that day. -- 1 samuel 14:37
.
Saul said, "Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and investigate and see how this sin has happened today. -- 1 samuel 14:38
.
"For as the LORD lives, who delivers Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But not one of all the people answered him. -- 1 samuel 14:39
.
Then he said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you." -- 1 samuel 14:40
.
Therefore, Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Give a perfect lot." And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped. -- 1 samuel 14:41
.
Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken. -- 1 samuel 14:42
.
Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him and said, "I indeed tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die!" -- 1 samuel 14:43
.
Saul said, "May God do this to me and more also, for you shall surely die, Jonathan." -- 1 samuel 14:44
.
But the people said to Saul, "Must Jonathan die, who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day." So the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die. -- 1 samuel 14:45
.
Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place. -- 1 samuel 14:46
.
Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, the sons of Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines; and wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment. -- 1 samuel 14:47
.
He acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them. -- 1 samuel 14:48
.
Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger Michal. -- 1 samuel 14:49
.
The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. -- 1 samuel 14:50
.
Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. -- 1 samuel 14:51
.
Now the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he attached him to his staff. -- 1 samuel 14:52
.
Then Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people, over Israel; now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 15:1
.
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt. -- 1 samuel 15:2
.
'Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'" -- 1 samuel 15:3
.
Then Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, 200,foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. -- 1 samuel 15:4
.
Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley. -- 1 samuel 15:5
.
Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. -- 1 samuel 15:6
.
So Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is east of Egypt. -- 1 samuel 15:7
.
He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. -- 1 samuel 15:8
.
But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to destroy them utterly; but everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed. -- 1 samuel 15:9
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying, -- 1 samuel 15:10
.
"I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands." And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all night. -- 1 samuel 15:11
.
Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was told Samuel, saying, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal." -- 1 samuel 15:12
.
Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed are you of the LORD! I have carried out the command of the LORD." -- 1 samuel 15:13
.
But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?" -- 1 samuel 15:14
.
Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have utterly destroyed." -- 1 samuel 15:15
.
Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait, and let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." And he said to him, "Speak!" -- 1 samuel 15:16
.
Samuel said, "Is it not true, though you were little in your own eyes, you were made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed you king over Israel, -- 1 samuel 15:17
.
and the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, 'Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are exterminated.' -- 1 samuel 15:18
.
"Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but rushed upon the spoil and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD?" -- 1 samuel 15:19
.
Then Saul said to Samuel, "I did obey the voice of the LORD, and went on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and have brought back Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. -- 1 samuel 15:20
.
"But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal." -- 1 samuel 15:21
.
Samuel said, "Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams. -- 1 samuel 15:22
.
"For rebellion is as the sin of divination, And insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king." -- 1 samuel 15:23
.
Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice. -- 1 samuel 15:24
.
"Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship the LORD." -- 1 samuel 15:25
.
But Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel." -- 1 samuel 15:26
.
As Samuel turned to go, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore. -- 1 samuel 15:27
.
So Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor, who is better than you. -- 1 samuel 15:28
.
"Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His mind; for He is not a man that He should change His mind." -- 1 samuel 15:29
.
Then he said, "I have sinned; but please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and go back with me, that I may worship the LORD your God." -- 1 samuel 15:30
.
So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD. -- 1 samuel 15:31
.
Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites." And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past." -- 1 samuel 15:32
.
But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women." And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal. -- 1 samuel 15:33
.
Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul. -- 1 samuel 15:34
.
Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel. -- 1 samuel 15:35
.
Now the LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have selected a king for Myself among his sons." -- 1 samuel 16:1
.
But Samuel said, "How can I go? When Saul hears of it, he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.' -- 1 samuel 16:2
.
"You shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate to you." -- 1 samuel 16:3
.
So Samuel did what the LORD said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, "Do you come in peace?" -- 1 samuel 16:4
.
He said, "In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." He also consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. -- 1 samuel 16:5
.
When they entered, he looked at Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD'S anointed is before Him." -- 1 samuel 16:6
.
But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." -- 1 samuel 16:7
.
Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either." -- 1 samuel 16:8
.
Next Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either." -- 1 samuel 16:9
.
Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these." -- 1 samuel 16:10
.
And Samuel said to Jesse, "Are these all the children?" And he said, "There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is tending the sheep." Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here." -- 1 samuel 16:11
.
So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he." -- 1 samuel 16:12
.
Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah. -- 1 samuel 16:13
.
Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrorized him. -- 1 samuel 16:14
.
Saul's servants then said to him, "Behold now, an evil spirit from God is terrorizing you. -- 1 samuel 16:15
.
"Let our lord now command your servants who are before you. Let them seek a man who is a skillful player on the harp; and it shall come about when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play the harp with his hand, and you will be well." -- 1 samuel 16:16
.
So Saul said to his servants, "Provide for me now a man who can play well and bring him to me." -- 1 samuel 16:17
.
Then one of the young men said, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a mighty man of valor, a warrior, one prudent in speech, and a handsome man; and the LORD is with him." -- 1 samuel 16:18
.
So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David who is with the flock." -- 1 samuel 16:19
.
Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a jug of wine and a young goat, and sent them to Saul by David his son. -- 1 samuel 16:20
.
Then David came to Saul and attended him; and Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer. -- 1 samuel 16:21
.
Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David now stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight." -- 1 samuel 16:22
.
So it came about whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand; and Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would depart from him. -- 1 samuel 16:23
.
Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. -- 1 samuel 17:1
.
Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and camped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array to encounter the Philistines. -- 1 samuel 17:2
.
The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side while Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them. -- 1 samuel 17:3
.
Then a champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. -- 1 samuel 17:4
.
He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with scale-armor which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze. -- 1 samuel 17:5
.
He also had bronze greaves on his legs and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders. -- 1 samuel 17:6
.
The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron; his shield-carrier also walked before him. -- 1 samuel 17:7
.
He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them, "Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. -- 1 samuel 17:8
.
"If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us." -- 1 samuel 17:9
.
Again the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together." -- 1 samuel 17:10
.
When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid. -- 1 samuel 17:11
.
Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men. -- 1 samuel 17:12
.
The three older sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. -- 1 samuel 17:13
.
David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul, -- 1 samuel 17:14
.
but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's flock at Bethlehem. -- 1 samuel 17:15
.
The Philistine came forward morning and evening for forty days and took his stand. -- 1 samuel 17:16
.
Then Jesse said to David his son, "Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves and run to the camp to your brothers. -- 1 samuel 17:17
.
"Bring also these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand, and look into the welfare of your brothers, and bring back news of them. -- 1 samuel 17:18
.
"For Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines." -- 1 samuel 17:19
.
So David arose early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and took the supplies and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the circle of the camp while the army was going out in battle array shouting the war cry. -- 1 samuel 17:20
.
Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army. -- 1 samuel 17:21
.
Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers. -- 1 samuel 17:22
.
As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard them. -- 1 samuel 17:23
.
When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were greatly afraid. -- 1 samuel 17:24
.
The men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it will be that the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel." -- 1 samuel 17:25
.
Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should taunt the armies of the living God?" -- 1 samuel 17:26
.
The people answered him in accord with this word, saying, "Thus it will be done for the man who kills him." -- 1 samuel 17:27
.
Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger burned against David and he said, "Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle." -- 1 samuel 17:28
.
But David said, "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?" -- 1 samuel 17:29
.
Then he turned away from him to another and said the same thing; and the people answered the same thing as before. -- 1 samuel 17:30
.
When the words which David spoke were heard, they told them to Saul, and he sent for him. -- 1 samuel 17:31
.
David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine." -- 1 samuel 17:32
.
Then Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth while he has been a warrior from his youth." -- 1 samuel 17:33
.
But David said to Saul, "Your servant was tending his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock, -- 1 samuel 17:34
.
I went out after him and attacked him, and rescued it from his mouth; and when he rose up against me, I seized him by his beard and struck him and killed him. -- 1 samuel 17:35
.
"Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted the armies of the living God." -- 1 samuel 17:36
.
And David said, "The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said to David, "Go, and may the LORD be with you." -- 1 samuel 17:37
.
Then Saul clothed David with his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with armor. -- 1 samuel 17:38
.
David girded his sword over his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. So David said to Saul, "I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them." And David took them off. -- 1 samuel 17:39
.
He took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his pouch, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine. -- 1 samuel 17:40
.
Then the Philistine came on and approached David, with the shield-bearer in front of him. -- 1 samuel 17:41
.
When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance. -- 1 samuel 17:42
.
The Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. -- 1 samuel 17:43
.
The Philistine also said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field." -- 1 samuel 17:44
.
Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted. -- 1 samuel 17:45
.
"This day the LORD will deliver you up into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, -- 1 samuel 17:46
.
and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give you into our hands." -- 1 samuel 17:47
.
Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. -- 1 samuel 17:48
.
And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground. -- 1 samuel 17:49
.
Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David's hand. -- 1 samuel 17:50
.
Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. -- 1 samuel 17:51
.
The men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines as far as the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the slain Philistines lay along the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron. -- 1 samuel 17:52
.
The sons of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines and plundered their camps. -- 1 samuel 17:53
.
Then David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent. -- 1 samuel 17:54
.
Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this young man?" And Abner said, "By your life, O king, I do not know." -- 1 samuel 17:55
.
The king said, "You inquire whose son the youth is." -- 1 samuel 17:56
.
So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand. -- 1 samuel 17:57
.
Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite." -- 1 samuel 17:58
.
Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. -- 1 samuel 18:1
.
Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house. -- 1 samuel 18:2
.
Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. -- 1 samuel 18:3
.
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt. -- 1 samuel 18:4
.
So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants. -- 1 samuel 18:5
.
It happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with musical instruments. -- 1 samuel 18:6
.
The women sang as they played, and said, "Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands." -- 1 samuel 18:7
.
Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?" -- 1 samuel 18:8
.
Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on. -- 1 samuel 18:9
.
Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing the harp with his hand, as usual; and a spear was in Saul's hand. -- 1 samuel 18:10
.
Saul hurled the spear for he thought, "I will pin David to the wall." But David escaped from his presence twice. -- 1 samuel 18:11
.
Now Saul was afraid of David, for the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul. -- 1 samuel 18:12
.
Therefore Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. -- 1 samuel 18:13
.
David was prospering in all his ways for the LORD was with him. -- 1 samuel 18:14
.
When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he dreaded him. -- 1 samuel 18:15
.
But all Israel and Judah loved David, and he went out and came in before them. -- 1 samuel 18:16
.
Then Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for me and fight the LORD'S battles." For Saul thought, "My hand shall not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him." -- 1 samuel 18:17
.
But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my life or my father's family in Israel, that I should be the king's son-in-law?" -- 1 samuel 18:18
.
So it came about at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife. -- 1 samuel 18:19
.
Now Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. When they told Saul, the thing was agreeable to him. -- 1 samuel 18:20
.
Saul thought, "I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." Therefore Saul said to David, "For a second time you may be my son-in-law today." -- 1 samuel 18:21
.
Then Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David secretly, saying, 'Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now therefore, become the king's son-in-law.'" -- 1 samuel 18:22
.
So Saul's servants spoke these words to David. But David said, "Is it trivial in your sight to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?" -- 1 samuel 18:23
.
The servants of Saul reported to him according to these words which David spoke. -- 1 samuel 18:24
.
Saul then said, "Thus you shall say to David, 'The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king's enemies.'" Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. -- 1 samuel 18:25
.
When his servants told David these words, it pleased David to become the king's son-in-law. Before the days had expired -- 1 samuel 18:26
.
David rose up and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife. -- 1 samuel 18:27
.
When Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him, -- 1 samuel 18:28
.
then Saul was even more afraid of David. Thus Saul was David's enemy continually. -- 1 samuel 18:29
.
Then the commanders of the Philistines went out to battle, and it happened as often as they went out, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul. So his name was highly esteemed. -- 1 samuel 18:30
.
Now Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul's son, greatly delighted in David. -- 1 samuel 19:1
.
So Jonathan told David saying, "Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now therefore, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself. -- 1 samuel 19:2
.
"I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you; if I find out anything, then I will tell you." -- 1 samuel 19:3
.
Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Do not let the king sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial to you. -- 1 samuel 19:4
.
"For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death without a cause?" -- 1 samuel 19:5
.
Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul vowed, "As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death." -- 1 samuel 19:6
.
Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as formerly. -- 1 samuel 19:7
.
When there was war again, David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated them with great slaughter, so that they fled before him. -- 1 samuel 19:8
.
Now there was an evil spirit from the LORD on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing the harp with his hand. -- 1 samuel 19:9
.
Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, so that he stuck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night. -- 1 samuel 19:10
.
Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, "If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death." -- 1 samuel 19:11
.
So Michal let David down through a window, and he went out and fled and escaped. -- 1 samuel 19:12
.
Michal took the household idol and laid it on the bed, and put a quilt of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with clothes. -- 1 samuel 19:13
.
When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick." -- 1 samuel 19:14
.
Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me on his bed, that I may put him to death." -- 1 samuel 19:15
.
When the messengers entered, behold, the household idol was on the bed with the quilt of goats' hair at its head. -- 1 samuel 19:16
.
So Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?" And Michal said to Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I put you to death?'" -- 1 samuel 19:17
.
Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. -- 1 samuel 19:18
.
It was told Saul, saying, "Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah." -- 1 samuel 19:19
.
Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied. -- 1 samuel 19:20
.
When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. -- 1 samuel 19:21
.
Then he himself went to Ramah and came as far as the large well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, "Where are Samuel and David?" And someone said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah." -- 1 samuel 19:22
.
He proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah. -- 1 samuel 19:23
.
He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" -- 1 samuel 19:24
.
Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?" -- 1 samuel 20:1
.
He said to him, "Far from it, you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!" -- 1 samuel 20:2
.
Yet David vowed again, saying, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.' But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is hardly a step between me and death." -- 1 samuel 20:3
.
Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you say, I will do for you." -- 1 samuel 20:4
.
So David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening. -- 1 samuel 20:5
.
"If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.' -- 1 samuel 20:6
.
"If he says, 'It is good,' your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, know that he has decided on evil. -- 1 samuel 20:7
.
"Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is iniquity in me, put me to death yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?" -- 1 samuel 20:8
.
Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! For if I should indeed learn that evil has been decided by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you about it?" -- 1 samuel 20:9
.
Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?" -- 1 samuel 20:10
.
Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field." So both of them went out to the field. -- 1 samuel 20:11
.
Then Jonathan said to David, "The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good feeling toward David, shall I not then send to you and make it known to you? -- 1 samuel 20:12
.
"If it please my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also, if I do not make it known to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father. -- 1 samuel 20:13
.
"If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness of the LORD, that I may not die? -- 1 samuel 20:14
.
"You shall not cut off your lovingkindness from my house forever, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth." -- 1 samuel 20:15
.
So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD require it at the hands of David's enemies." -- 1 samuel 20:16
.
Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life. -- 1 samuel 20:17
.
Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed because your seat will be empty. -- 1 samuel 20:18
.
"When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain by the stone Ezel. -- 1 samuel 20:19
.
"I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target. -- 1 samuel 20:20
.
"And behold, I will send the lad, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I specifically say to the lad, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,' then come; for there is safety for you and no harm, as the LORD lives. -- 1 samuel 20:21
.
"But if I say to the youth, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you,' go, for the LORD has sent you away. -- 1 samuel 20:22
.
"As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever." -- 1 samuel 20:23
.
So David hid in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food. -- 1 samuel 20:24
.
The king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall; then Jonathan rose up and Abner sat down by Saul's side, but David's place was empty. -- 1 samuel 20:25
.
Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day, for he thought, "It is an accident, he is not clean, surely he is not clean." -- 1 samuel 20:26
.
It came about the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David's place was empty; so Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?" -- 1 samuel 20:27
.
Jonathan then answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem, -- 1 samuel 20:28
.
for he said, 'Please let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. And now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me get away that I may see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table." -- 1 samuel 20:29
.
Then Saul's anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness? -- 1 samuel 20:30
.
"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now, send and bring him to me, for he must surely die." -- 1 samuel 20:31
.
But Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" -- 1 samuel 20:32
.
Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death. -- 1 samuel 20:33
.
Then Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonored him. -- 1 samuel 20:34
.
Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little lad was with him. -- 1 samuel 20:35
.
He said to his lad, "Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot." As the lad was running, he shot an arrow past him. -- 1 samuel 20:36
.
When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad and said, "Is not the arrow beyond you?" -- 1 samuel 20:37
.
And Jonathan called after the lad, "Hurry, be quick, do not stay!" And Jonathan's lad picked up the arrow and came to his master. -- 1 samuel 20:38
.
But the lad was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter. -- 1 samuel 20:39
.
Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, "Go, bring them to the city." -- 1 samuel 20:40
.
When the lad was gone, David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David wept the more. -- 1 samuel 20:41
.
Jonathan said to David, "Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.'" Then he rose and departed, while Jonathan went into the city. -- 1 samuel 20:42
.
Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, "Why are you alone and no one with you?" -- 1 samuel 21:1
.
David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king has commissioned me with a matter and has said to me, 'Let no one know anything about the matter on which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you; and I have directed the young men to a certain place.' -- 1 samuel 21:2
.
"Now therefore, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found." -- 1 samuel 21:3
.
The priest answered David and said, "There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is consecrated bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women." -- 1 samuel 21:4
.
David answered the priest and said to him, "Surely women have been kept from us as previously when I set out and the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their vessels be holy?" -- 1 samuel 21:5
.
So the priest gave him consecrated bread; for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence which was removed from before the LORD, in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away. -- 1 samuel 21:6
.
Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds. -- 1 samuel 21:7
.
David said to Ahimelech, "Now is there not a spear or a sword on hand? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's matter was urgent." -- 1 samuel 21:8
.
Then the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, take it. For there is no other except it here." And David said, "There is none like it; give it to me." -- 1 samuel 21:9
.
Then David arose and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath. -- 1 samuel 21:10
.
But the servants of Achish said to him, "Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of this one as they danced, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands'?" -- 1 samuel 21:11
.
David took these words to heart and greatly feared Achish king of Gath. -- 1 samuel 21:12
.
So he disguised his sanity before them, and acted insanely in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down into his beard. -- 1 samuel 21:13
.
Then Achish said to his servants, "Behold, you see the man behaving as a madman. Why do you bring him to me? -- 1 samuel 21:14
.
"Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this one to act the madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?" -- 1 samuel 21:15
.
So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's household heard of it, they went down there to him. -- 1 samuel 22:1
.
Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him. -- 1 samuel 22:2
.
And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me." -- 1 samuel 22:3
.
Then he left them with the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. -- 1 samuel 22:4
.
The prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah." So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth. -- 1 samuel 22:5
.
Then Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him. -- 1 samuel 22:6
.
Saul said to his servants who stood around him, "Hear now, O Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse also give to all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? -- 1 samuel 22:7
.
"For all of you have conspired against me so that there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush, as it is this day." -- 1 samuel 22:8
.
Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, said, "I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. -- 1 samuel 22:9
.
"He inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine." -- 1 samuel 22:10
.
Then the king sent someone to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's household, the priests who were in Nob; and all of them came to the king. -- 1 samuel 22:11
.
Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." And he answered, "Here I am, my lord." -- 1 samuel 22:12
.
Saul then said to him, "Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he would rise up against me by lying in ambush as it is this day?" -- 1 samuel 22:13
.
Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, "And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, even the king's son-in-law, who is captain over your guard, and is honored in your house? -- 1 samuel 22:14
.
"Did I just begin to inquire of God for him today? Far be it from me! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant or to any of the household of my father, for your servant knows nothing at all of this whole affair." -- 1 samuel 22:15
.
But the king said, "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's household!" -- 1 samuel 22:16
.
And the king said to the guards who were attending him, "Turn around and put the priests of the LORD to death, because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not reveal it to me." But the servants of the king were not willing to put forth their hands to attack the priests of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 22:17
.
Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn around and attack the priests." And Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests, and he killed that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. -- 1 samuel 22:18
.
And he struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; also oxen, donkeys, and sheep he struck with the edge of the sword. -- 1 samuel 22:19
.
But one son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. -- 1 samuel 22:20
.
Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. -- 1 samuel 22:21
.
Then David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have brought about the death of every person in your father's household. -- 1 samuel 22:22
.
"Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life, for you are safe with me." -- 1 samuel 22:23
.
Then they told David, saying, "Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors." -- 1 samuel 23:1
.
So David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" And the LORD said to David, "Go and attack the Philistines and deliver Keilah." -- 1 samuel 23:2
.
But David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?" -- 1 samuel 23:3
.
Then David inquired of the LORD once more. And the LORD answered him and said, "Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand." -- 1 samuel 23:4
.
So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines; and he led away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter. Thus David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah. -- 1 samuel 23:5
.
Now it came about, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. -- 1 samuel 23:6
.
When it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, "God has delivered him into my hand, for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates and bars." -- 1 samuel 23:7
.
So Saul summoned all the people for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men. -- 1 samuel 23:8
.
Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; so he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here." -- 1 samuel 23:9
.
Then David said, "O LORD God of Israel, Your servant has heard for certain that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account. -- 1 samuel 23:10
.
"Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant." And the LORD said, "He will come down." -- 1 samuel 23:11
.
Then David said, "Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will surrender you." -- 1 samuel 23:12
.
Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit. -- 1 samuel 23:13
.
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand. -- 1 samuel 23:14
.
Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. -- 1 samuel 23:15
.
And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God. -- 1 samuel 23:16
.
Thus he said to him, "Do not be afraid, because the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also." -- 1 samuel 23:17
.
So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD; and David stayed at Horesh while Jonathan went to his house. -- 1 samuel 23:18
.
Then Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is David not hiding with us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? -- 1 samuel 23:19
.
"Now then, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to do so; and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand." -- 1 samuel 23:20
.
Saul said, "May you be blessed of the LORD, for you have had compassion on me. -- 1 samuel 23:21
.
"Go now, make more sure, and investigate and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning. -- 1 samuel 23:22
.
"So look, and learn about all the hiding places where he hides himself and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah." -- 1 samuel 23:23
.
Then they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. -- 1 samuel 23:24
.
When Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David, and he came down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard it, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon. -- 1 samuel 23:25
.
Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was hurrying to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to seize them. -- 1 samuel 23:26
.
But a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid on the land." -- 1 samuel 23:27
.
So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape. -- 1 samuel 23:28
.
David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi. -- 1 samuel 23:29
.
Now when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, saying, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi." -- 1 samuel 24:1
.
Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. -- 1 samuel 24:2
.
He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave. -- 1 samuel 24:3
.
The men of David said to him, "Behold, this is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'" Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly. -- 1 samuel 24:4
.
It came about afterward that David's conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul's robe. -- 1 samuel 24:5
.
So he said to his men, "Far be it from me because of the LORD that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is the LORD'S anointed." -- 1 samuel 24:6
.
David persuaded his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul arose, left the cave, and went on his way. -- 1 samuel 24:7
.
Now afterward David arose and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, "My lord the king!" And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself. -- 1 samuel 24:8
.
David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of men, saying, 'Behold, David seeks to harm you'? -- 1 samuel 24:9
.
"Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD had given you today into my hand in the cave, and some said to kill you, but my eye had pity on you; and I said, 'I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD'S anointed.' -- 1 samuel 24:10
.
"Now, my father, see! Indeed, see the edge of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the edge of your robe and did not kill you, know and perceive that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait for my life to take it. -- 1 samuel 24:11
.
"May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD avenge me on you; but my hand shall not be against you. -- 1 samuel 24:12
.
"As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness'; but my hand shall not be against you. -- 1 samuel 24:13
.
"After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, a single flea? -- 1 samuel 24:14
.
"The LORD therefore be judge and decide between you and me; and may He see and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand." -- 1 samuel 24:15
.
When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept. -- 1 samuel 24:16
.
He said to David, "You are more righteous than I; for you have dealt well with me, while I have dealt wickedly with you. -- 1 samuel 24:17
.
"You have declared today that you have done good to me, that the LORD delivered me into your hand and yet you did not kill me. -- 1 samuel 24:18
.
"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safely? May the LORD therefore reward you with good in return for what you have done to me this day. -- 1 samuel 24:19
.
"Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. -- 1 samuel 24:20
.
"So now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father's household." -- 1 samuel 24:21
.
David swore to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. -- 1 samuel 24:22
.
Then Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together and mourned for him, and buried him at his house in Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. -- 1 samuel 25:1
.
Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; and the man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And it came about while he was shearing his sheep in Carmel -- 1 samuel 25:2
.
(now the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. And the woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings, and he was a Calebite), -- 1 samuel 25:3
.
that David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. -- 1 samuel 25:4
.
So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, visit Nabal and greet him in my name; -- 1 samuel 25:5
.
and thus you shall say, 'Have a long life, peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have. -- 1 samuel 25:6
.
'Now I have heard that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us and we have not insulted them, nor have they missed anything all the days they were in Carmel. -- 1 samuel 25:7
.
'Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. Please give whatever you find at hand to your servants and to your son David.'" -- 1 samuel 25:8
.
When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in David's name; then they waited. -- 1 samuel 25:9
.
But Nabal answered David's servants and said, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today who are each breaking away from his master. -- 1 samuel 25:10
.
"Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men whose origin I do not know?" -- 1 samuel 25:11
.
So David's young men retraced their way and went back; and they came and told him according to all these words. -- 1 samuel 25:12
.
David said to his men, "Each of you gird on his sword." So each man girded on his sword. And David also girded on his sword, and about four hundred men went up behind David while two hundred stayed with the baggage. -- 1 samuel 25:13
.
But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, and he scorned them. -- 1 samuel 25:14
.
"Yet the men were very good to us, and we were not insulted, nor did we miss anything as long as we went about with them, while we were in the fields. -- 1 samuel 25:15
.
"They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them tending the sheep. -- 1 samuel 25:16
.
"Now therefore, know and consider what you should do, for evil is plotted against our master and against all his household; and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him." -- 1 samuel 25:17
.
Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread and two jugs of wine and five sheep already prepared and five measures of roasted grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys. -- 1 samuel 25:18
.
She said to her young men, "Go on before me; behold, I am coming after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal. -- 1 samuel 25:19
.
It came about as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by the hidden part of the mountain, that behold, David and his men were coming down toward her; so she met them. -- 1 samuel 25:20
.
Now David had said, "Surely in vain I have guarded all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has returned me evil for good. -- 1 samuel 25:21
.
"May God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if by morning I leave as much as one male of any who belong to him." -- 1 samuel 25:22
.
When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey, and fell on her face before David and bowed herself to the ground. -- 1 samuel 25:23
.
She fell at his feet and said, "On me alone, my lord, be the blame. And please let your maidservant speak to you, and listen to the words of your maidservant. -- 1 samuel 25:24
.
"Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name and folly is with him; but I your maidservant did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent. -- 1 samuel 25:25
.
"Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, since the LORD has restrained you from shedding blood, and from avenging yourself by your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek evil against my lord, be as Nabal. -- 1 samuel 25:26
.
"Now let this gift which your maidservant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who accompany my lord. -- 1 samuel 25:27
.
"Please forgive the transgression of your maidservant; for the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil will not be found in you all your days. -- 1 samuel 25:28
.
"Should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; but the lives of your enemies He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling. -- 1 samuel 25:29
.
"And when the LORD does for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and appoints you ruler over Israel, -- 1 samuel 25:30
.
this will not cause grief or a troubled heart to my lord, both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself. When the LORD deals well with my lord, then remember your maidservant." -- 1 samuel 25:31
.
Then David said to Abigail, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me, -- 1 samuel 25:32
.
and blessed be your discernment, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand. -- 1 samuel 25:33
.
"Nevertheless, as the LORD God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from harming you, unless you had come quickly to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal until the morning light as much as one male." -- 1 samuel 25:34
.
So David received from her hand what she had brought him and said to her, "Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to you and granted your request." -- 1 samuel 25:35
.
Then Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light. -- 1 samuel 25:36
.
But in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him so that he became as a stone. -- 1 samuel 25:37
.
About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died. -- 1 samuel 25:38
.
When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept back His servant from evil. The LORD has also returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head." Then David sent a proposal to Abigail, to take her as his wife. -- 1 samuel 25:39
.
When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, "David has sent us to you to take you as his wife." -- 1 samuel 25:40
.
She arose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, "Behold, your maidservant is a maid to wash the feet of my lord's servants." -- 1 samuel 25:41
.
Then Abigail quickly arose, and rode on a donkey, with her five maidens who attended her; and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife. -- 1 samuel 25:42
.
David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives. -- 1 samuel 25:43
.
Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim. -- 1 samuel 25:44
.
Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?" -- 1 samuel 26:1
.
So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph. -- 1 samuel 26:2
.
Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, beside the road, and David was staying in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness, -- 1 samuel 26:3
.
David sent out spies, and he knew that Saul was definitely coming. -- 1 samuel 26:4
.
David then arose and came to the place where Saul had camped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; and Saul was lying in the circle of the camp, and the people were camped around him. -- 1 samuel 26:5
.
Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" And Abishai said, "I will go down with you." -- 1 samuel 26:6
.
So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people were lying around him. -- 1 samuel 26:7
.
Then Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand; now therefore, please let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time." -- 1 samuel 26:8
.
But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him, for who can stretch out his hand against the LORD'S anointed and be without guilt?" -- 1 samuel 26:9
.
David also said, "As the LORD lives, surely the LORD will strike him, or his day will come that he dies, or he will go down into battle and perish. -- 1 samuel 26:10
.
"The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD'S anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go." -- 1 samuel 26:11
.
So David took the spear and the jug of water from beside Saul's head, and they went away, but no one saw or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a sound sleep from the LORD had fallen on them. -- 1 samuel 26:12
.
Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance with a large area between them. -- 1 samuel 26:13
.
David called to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Will you not answer, Abner?" Then Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?" -- 1 samuel 26:14
.
So David said to Abner, "Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy the king your lord. -- 1 samuel 26:15
.
"This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, all of you must surely die, because you did not guard your lord, the LORD'S anointed. And now, see where the king's spear is and the jug of water that was at his head." -- 1 samuel 26:16
.
Then Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord the king." -- 1 samuel 26:17
.
He also said, "Why then is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand? -- 1 samuel 26:18
.
"Now therefore, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is men, cursed are they before the LORD, for they have driven me out today so that I would have no attachment with the inheritance of the LORD, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.' -- 1 samuel 26:19
.
"Now then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea, just as one hunts a partridge in the mountains." -- 1 samuel 26:20
.
Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again because my life was precious in your sight this day. Behold, I have played the fool and have committed a serious error." -- 1 samuel 26:21
.
David replied, "Behold the spear of the king! Now let one of the young men come over and take it. -- 1 samuel 26:22
.
"The LORD will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I refused to stretch out my hand against the LORD'S anointed. -- 1 samuel 26:23
.
"Now behold, as your life was highly valued in my sight this day, so may my life be highly valued in the sight of the LORD, and may He deliver me from all distress." -- 1 samuel 26:24
.
Then Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David; you will both accomplish much and surely prevail." So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place. -- 1 samuel 26:25
.
Then David said to himself, "Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape into the land of the Philistines. Saul then will despair of searching for me anymore in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand." -- 1 samuel 27:1
.
So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. -- 1 samuel 27:2
.
And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's widow. -- 1 samuel 27:3
.
Now it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him. -- 1 samuel 27:4
.
Then David said to Achish, "If now I have found favor in your sight, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?" -- 1 samuel 27:5
.
So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. -- 1 samuel 27:6
.
The number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months. -- 1 samuel 27:7
.
Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites; for they were the inhabitants of the land from ancient times, as you come to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt. -- 1 samuel 27:8
.
David attacked the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, and he took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish. -- 1 samuel 27:9
.
Now Achish said, "Where have you made a raid today?" And David said, "Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites." -- 1 samuel 27:10
.
David did not leave a man or a woman alive to bring to Gath, saying, "Otherwise they will tell about us, saying, 'So has David done and so has been his practice all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.'" -- 1 samuel 27:11
.
So Achish believed David, saying, "He has surely made himself odious among his people Israel; therefore he will become my servant forever." -- 1 samuel 27:12
.
Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armed camps for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, "Know assuredly that you will go out with me in the camp, you and your men." -- 1 samuel 28:1
.
David said to Achish, "Very well, you shall know what your servant can do." So Achish said to David, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life." -- 1 samuel 28:2
.
Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists. -- 1 samuel 28:3
.
So the Philistines gathered together and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped in Gilboa. -- 1 samuel 28:4
.
When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. -- 1 samuel 28:5
.
When Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets. -- 1 samuel 28:6
.
Then Saul said to his servants, "Seek for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her." And his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor." -- 1 samuel 28:7
.
Then Saul disguised himself by putting on other clothes, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, "Conjure up for me, please, and bring up for me whom I shall name to you." -- 1 samuel 28:8
.
But the woman said to him, "Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?" -- 1 samuel 28:9
.
Saul vowed to her by the LORD, saying, "As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing." -- 1 samuel 28:10
.
Then the woman said, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" And he said, "Bring up Samuel for me." -- 1 samuel 28:11
.
When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, "Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul." -- 1 samuel 28:12
.
The king said to her, "Do not be afraid; but what do you see?" And the woman said to Saul, "I see a divine being coming up out of the earth." -- 1 samuel 28:13
.
He said to her, "What is his form?" And she said, "An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe." And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and did homage. -- 1 samuel 28:14
.
Then Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" And Saul answered, "I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has departed from me and no longer answers me, either through prophets or by dreams; therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I should do." -- 1 samuel 28:15
.
Samuel said, "Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has departed from you and has become your adversary? -- 1 samuel 28:16
.
"The LORD has done accordingly as He spoke through me; for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, to David. -- 1 samuel 28:17
.
"As you did not obey the LORD and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, so the LORD has done this thing to you this day. -- 1 samuel 28:18
.
"Moreover the LORD will also give over Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines, therefore tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Indeed the LORD will give over the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines!" -- 1 samuel 28:19
.
Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground and was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; also there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day and all night. -- 1 samuel 28:20
.
The woman came to Saul and saw that he was terrified, and said to him, "Behold, your maidservant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me. -- 1 samuel 28:21
.
"So now also, please listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you that you may eat and have strength when you go on your way." -- 1 samuel 28:22
.
But he refused and said, "I will not eat." However, his servants together with the woman urged him, and he listened to them. So he arose from the ground and sat on the bed. -- 1 samuel 28:23
.
The woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly slaughtered it; and she took flour, kneaded it and baked unleavened bread from it. -- 1 samuel 28:24
.
She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night. -- 1 samuel 28:25
.
Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring which is in Jezreel. -- 1 samuel 29:1
.
And the lords of the Philistines were proceeding on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were proceeding on in the rear with Achish. -- 1 samuel 29:2
.
Then the commanders of the Philistines said, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, "Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him from the day he deserted to me to this day?" -- 1 samuel 29:3
.
But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him, and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, "Make the man go back, that he may return to his place where you have assigned him, and do not let him go down to battle with us, or in the battle he may become an adversary to us. For with what could this man make himself acceptable to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of these men? -- 1 samuel 29:4
.
"Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands'?" -- 1 samuel 29:5
.
Then Achish called David and said to him, "As the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army are pleasing in my sight; for I have not found evil in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, you are not pleasing in the sight of the lords. -- 1 samuel 29:6
.
"Now therefore return and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines." -- 1 samuel 29:7
.
David said to Achish, "But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day when I came before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?" -- 1 samuel 29:8
.
But Achish replied to David, "I know that you are pleasing in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He must not go up with us to the battle.' -- 1 samuel 29:9
.
"Now then arise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you, and as soon as you have arisen early in the morning and have light, depart." -- 1 samuel 29:10
.
So David arose early, he and his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel. -- 1 samuel 29:11
.
Then it happened when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag, and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire; -- 1 samuel 30:1
.
and they took captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great, without killing anyone, and carried them off and went their way. -- 1 samuel 30:2
.
When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive. -- 1 samuel 30:3
.
Then David and the people who were with him lifted their voices and wept until there was no strength in them to weep. -- 1 samuel 30:4
.
Now David's two wives had been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. -- 1 samuel 30:5
.
Moreover David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for all the people were embittered, each one because of his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God. -- 1 samuel 30:6
.
Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Please bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. -- 1 samuel 30:7
.
David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I pursue this band? Shall I overtake them?" And He said to him, "Pursue, for you will surely overtake them, and you will surely rescue all." -- 1 samuel 30:8
.
So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those left behind remained. -- 1 samuel 30:9
.
But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor remained behind. -- 1 samuel 30:10
.
Now they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David, and gave him bread and he ate, and they provided him water to drink. -- 1 samuel 30:11
.
They gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins, and he ate; then his spirit revived. For he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights. -- 1 samuel 30:12
.
David said to him, "To whom do you belong? And where are you from?" And he said, "I am a young man of Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind when I fell sick three days ago. -- 1 samuel 30:13
.
"We made a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire." -- 1 samuel 30:14
.
Then David said to him, "Will you bring me down to this band?" And he said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band." -- 1 samuel 30:15
.
When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. -- 1 samuel 30:16
.
David slaughtered them from the twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled. -- 1 samuel 30:17
.
So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives. -- 1 samuel 30:18
.
But nothing of theirs was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken for themselves; David brought it all back. -- 1 samuel 30:19
.
So David had captured all the sheep and the cattle which the people drove ahead of the other livestock, and they said, "This is David's spoil." -- 1 samuel 30:20
.
When David came to the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow David, who had also been left at the brook Besor, and they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him, then David approached the people and greeted them. -- 1 samuel 30:21
.
Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who went with David said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away and depart." -- 1 samuel 30:22
.
Then David said, "You must not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us, who has kept us and delivered into our hand the band that came against us. -- 1 samuel 30:23
.
"And who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike." -- 1 samuel 30:24
.
So it has been from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day. -- 1 samuel 30:25
.
Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, "Behold, a gift for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD: -- 1 samuel 30:26
.
to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the Negev, and to those who were in Jattir, -- 1 samuel 30:27
.
and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa, -- 1 samuel 30:28
.
and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites, -- 1 samuel 30:29
.
and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Bor-ashan, and to those who were in Athach, -- 1 samuel 30:30
.
and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to go." -- 1 samuel 30:31
.
Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. -- 1 samuel 31:1
.
The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua the sons of Saul. -- 1 samuel 31:2
.
The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was badly wounded by the archers. -- 1 samuel 31:3
.
Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and pierce me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and pierce me through and make sport of me." But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it. -- 1 samuel 31:4
.
When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him. -- 1 samuel 31:5
.
Thus Saul died with his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men on that day together. -- 1 samuel 31:6
.
When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, with those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; then the Philistines came and lived in them. -- 1 samuel 31:7
.
It came about on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. -- 1 samuel 31:8
.
They cut off his head and stripped off his weapons, and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to the house of their idols and to the people. -- 1 samuel 31:9
.
They put his weapons in the temple of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. -- 1 samuel 31:10
.
Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, -- 1 samuel 31:11
.
all the valiant men rose and walked all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there. -- 1 samuel 31:12
.
They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. -- 1 samuel 31:13
.
Now it came about after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David remained two days in Ziklag. -- 2 samuel 1:1
.
On the third day, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn and dust on his head. And it came about when he came to David that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself. -- 2 samuel 1:2
.
Then David said to him, "From where do you come?" And he said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel." -- 2 samuel 1:3
.
David said to him, "How did things go? Please tell me." And he said, "The people have fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also." -- 2 samuel 1:4
.
So David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?" -- 2 samuel 1:5
.
The young man who told him said, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen pursued him closely. -- 2 samuel 1:6
.
"When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I said, 'Here I am.' -- 2 samuel 1:7
.
"He said to me, 'Who are you?' And I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.' -- 2 samuel 1:8
.
"Then he said to me, 'Please stand beside me and kill me, for agony has seized me because my life still lingers in me.' -- 2 samuel 1:9
.
"So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which was on his head and the bracelet which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord." -- 2 samuel 1:10
.
Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so also did all the men who were with him. -- 2 samuel 1:11
.
They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. -- 2 samuel 1:12
.
David said to the young man who told him, "Where are you from?" And he answered, "I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite." -- 2 samuel 1:13
.
Then David said to him, "How is it you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?" -- 2 samuel 1:14
.
And David called one of the young men and said, "Go, cut him down." So he struck him and he died. -- 2 samuel 1:15
.
David said to him, "Your blood is on your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the LORD'S anointed.'" -- 2 samuel 1:16
.
Then David chanted with this lament over Saul and Jonathan his son, -- 2 samuel 1:17
.
and he told them to teach the sons of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar. -- 2 samuel 1:18
.
"Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How have the mighty fallen! -- 2 samuel 1:19
.
"Tell it not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, Or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, The daughters of the uncircumcised will exult. -- 2 samuel 1:20
.
"O mountains of Gilboa, Let not dew or rain be on you, nor fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil. -- 2 samuel 1:21
.
"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan did not turn back, And the sword of Saul did not return empty. -- 2 samuel 1:22
.
"Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their life, And in their death they were not parted; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions. -- 2 samuel 1:23
.
"O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel. -- 2 samuel 1:24
.
"How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places. -- 2 samuel 1:25
.
"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was more wonderful Than the love of women. -- 2 samuel 1:26
.
"How have the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!" -- 2 samuel 1:27
.
Then it came about afterwards that David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up." So David said, "Where shall I go up?" And He said, "To Hebron." -- 2 samuel 2:1
.
So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. -- 2 samuel 2:2
.
And David brought up his men who were with him, each with his household; and they lived in the cities of Hebron. -- 2 samuel 2:3
.
Then the men of Judah came and there anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, "It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul." -- 2 samuel 2:4
.
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, "May you be blessed of the LORD because you have shown this kindness to Saul your lord, and have buried him. -- 2 samuel 2:5
.
"Now may the LORD show lovingkindness and truth to you; and I also will show this goodness to you, because you have done this thing. -- 2 samuel 2:6
.
"Now therefore, let your hands be strong and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them." -- 2 samuel 2:7
.
But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. -- 2 samuel 2:8
.
He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, even over all Israel. -- 2 samuel 2:9
.
Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was king for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David. -- 2 samuel 2:10
.
The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. -- 2 samuel 2:11
.
Now Abner the son of Ner, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul. -- 2 samuel 2:12
.
And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool. -- 2 samuel 2:13
.
Then Abner said to Joab, "Now let the young men arise and hold a contest before us." And Joab said, "Let them arise." -- 2 samuel 2:14
.
So they arose and went over by count, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. -- 2 samuel 2:15
.
Each one of them seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent's side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. -- 2 samuel 2:16
.
That day the battle was very severe, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David. -- 2 samuel 2:17
.
Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel; and Asahel was as swift-footed as one of the gazelles which is in the field. -- 2 samuel 2:18
.
Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from following Abner. -- 2 samuel 2:19
.
Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Is that you, Asahel?" And he answered, "It is I." -- 2 samuel 2:20
.
So Abner said to him, "Turn to your right or to your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take for yourself his spoil." But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him. -- 2 samuel 2:21
.
Abner repeated again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?" -- 2 samuel 2:22
.
However, he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner struck him in the belly with the butt end of the spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died on the spot. And it came about that all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still. -- 2 samuel 2:23
.
But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and when the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is in front of Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. -- 2 samuel 2:24
.
The sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one band, and they stood on the top of a certain hill. -- 2 samuel 2:25
.
Then Abner called to Joab and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long will you refrain from telling the people to turn back from following their brothers?" -- 2 samuel 2:26
.
Joab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother." -- 2 samuel 2:27
.
So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and pursued Israel no longer, nor did they continue to fight anymore. -- 2 samuel 2:28
.
Abner and his men then went through the Arabah all that night; so they crossed the Jordan, walked all morning, and came to Mahanaim. -- 2 samuel 2:29
.
Then Joab returned from following Abner; when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David's servants besides Asahel were missing. -- 2 samuel 2:30
.
But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner's men, so that three hundred and sixty men died. -- 2 samuel 2:31
.
And they took up Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb which was in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men went all night until the day dawned at Hebron. -- 2 samuel 2:32
.
Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew steadily stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker continually. -- 2 samuel 3:1
.
Sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; -- 2 samuel 3:2
.
and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; -- 2 samuel 3:3
.
and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; -- 2 samuel 3:4
.
and the sixth, Ithream, by David's wife Eglah. These were born to David at Hebron. -- 2 samuel 3:5
.
It came about while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul. -- 2 samuel 3:6
.
Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?" -- 2 samuel 3:7
.
Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hands of David; and yet today you charge me with a guilt concerning the woman. -- 2 samuel 3:8
.
"May God do so to Abner, and more also, if as the LORD has sworn to David, I do not accomplish this for him, -- 2 samuel 3:9
.
to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba." -- 2 samuel 3:10
.
And he could no longer answer Abner a word, because he was afraid of him. -- 2 samuel 3:11
.
Then Abner sent messengers to David in his place, saying, "Whose is the land? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you." -- 2 samuel 3:12
.
He said, "Good! I will make a covenant with you, but I demand one thing of you, namely, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me." -- 2 samuel 3:13
.
So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines." -- 2 samuel 3:14
.
Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish. -- 2 samuel 3:15
.
But her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go, return." So he returned. -- 2 samuel 3:16
.
Now Abner had consultation with the elders of Israel, saying, "In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you. -- 2 samuel 3:17
.
"Now then, do it! For the LORD has spoken of David, saying, 'By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'" -- 2 samuel 3:18
.
Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin; and in addition Abner went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin. -- 2 samuel 3:19
.
Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. -- 2 samuel 3:20
.
Abner said to David, "Let me arise and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that your soul desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace. -- 2 samuel 3:21
.
And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. -- 2 samuel 3:22
.
When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, saying, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace." -- 2 samuel 3:23
.
Then Joab came to the king and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you sent him away and he is already gone? -- 2 samuel 3:24
.
"You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you and to learn of your going out and coming in and to find out all that you are doing." -- 2 samuel 3:25
.
When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it. -- 2 samuel 3:26
.
So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly so that he died on account of the blood of Asahel his brother. -- 2 samuel 3:27
.
Afterward when David heard it, he said, "I and my kingdom are innocent before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. -- 2 samuel 3:28
.
"May it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father's house; and may there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who takes hold of a distaff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread." -- 2 samuel 3:29
.
So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon. -- 2 samuel 3:30
.
Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes and gird on sackcloth and lament before Abner." And King David walked behind the bier. -- 2 samuel 3:31
.
Thus they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. -- 2 samuel 3:32
.
The king chanted a lament for Abner and said, "Should Abner die as a fool dies? -- 2 samuel 3:33
.
"Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters; As one falls before the wicked, you have fallen." And all the people wept again over him. -- 2 samuel 3:34
.
Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was still day; but David vowed, saying, "May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down." -- 2 samuel 3:35
.
Now all the people took note of it, and it pleased them, just as everything the king did pleased all the people. -- 2 samuel 3:36
.
So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the will of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death. -- 2 samuel 3:37
.
Then the king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? -- 2 samuel 3:38
.
"I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too difficult for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil." -- 2 samuel 3:39
.
Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was disturbed. -- 2 samuel 4:1
.
Saul's son had two men who were commanders of bands: the name of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin, -- 2 samuel 4:2
.
and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been aliens there until this day). -- 2 samuel 4:3
.
Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. -- 2 samuel 4:4
.
So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest. -- 2 samuel 4:5
.
They came to the middle of the house as if to get wheat, and they struck him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. -- 2 samuel 4:6
.
Now when they came into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him and beheaded him. And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night. -- 2 samuel 4:7
.
Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the LORD has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants." -- 2 samuel 4:8
.
David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, -- 2 samuel 4:9
.
when one told me, saying, 'Behold, Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. -- 2 samuel 4:10
.
"How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hand and destroy you from the earth?" -- 2 samuel 4:11
.
Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron. -- 2 samuel 4:12
.
Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. -- 2 samuel 5:1
.
"Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and in. And the LORD said to you, 'You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be a ruler over Israel.'" -- 2 samuel 5:2
.
So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them before the LORD at Hebron; then they anointed David king over Israel. -- 2 samuel 5:3
.
David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. -- 2 samuel 5:4
.
At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. -- 2 samuel 5:5
.
Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, and they said to David, "You shall not come in here, but the blind and lame will turn you away"; thinking, "David cannot enter here." -- 2 samuel 5:6
.
Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is the city of David. -- 2 samuel 5:7
.
David said on that day, "Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him reach the lame and the blind, who are hated by David's soul, through the water tunnel." Therefore they say, "The blind or the lame shall not come into the house." -- 2 samuel 5:8
.
So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward. -- 2 samuel 5:9
.
David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him. -- 2 samuel 5:10
.
Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons; and they built a house for David. -- 2 samuel 5:11
.
And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel. -- 2 samuel 5:12
.
Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David. -- 2 samuel 5:13
.
Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, -- 2 samuel 5:14
.
Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, -- 2 samuel 5:15
.
Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet. -- 2 samuel 5:16
.
When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard of it, he went down to the stronghold. -- 2 samuel 5:17
.
Now the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim. -- 2 samuel 5:18
.
Then David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them into my hand?" And the LORD said to David, "Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand." -- 2 samuel 5:19
.
So David came to Baal-perazim and defeated them there; and he said, "The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters." Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim. -- 2 samuel 5:20
.
They abandoned their idols there, so David and his men carried them away. -- 2 samuel 5:21
.
Now the Philistines came up once again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim. -- 2 samuel 5:22
.
When David inquired of the LORD, He said, "You shall not go directly up; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees. -- 2 samuel 5:23
.
"It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall act promptly, for then the LORD will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines." -- 2 samuel 5:24
.
Then David did so, just as the LORD had commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer. -- 2 samuel 5:25
.
Now David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. -- 2 samuel 6:1
.
And David arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name, the very name of the LORD of hosts who is enthroned above the cherubim. -- 2 samuel 6:2
.
They placed the ark of God on a new cart that they might bring it from the house of Abinadab which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart. -- 2 samuel 6:3
.
So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking ahead of the ark. -- 2 samuel 6:4
.
Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, and with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets and cymbals. -- 2 samuel 6:5
.
But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen nearly upset it. -- 2 samuel 6:6
.
And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down there for his irreverence; and he died there by the ark of God. -- 2 samuel 6:7
.
David became angry because of the LORD'S outburst against Uzzah, and that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day. -- 2 samuel 6:8
.
So David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?" -- 2 samuel 6:9
.
And David was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD into the city of David with him; but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. -- 2 samuel 6:10
.
Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household. -- 2 samuel 6:11
.
Now it was told King David, saying, "The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God." David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. -- 2 samuel 6:12
.
And so it was, that when the bearers of the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. -- 2 samuel 6:13
.
And David was dancing before the LORD with all his might, and David was wearing a linen ephod. -- 2 samuel 6:14
.
So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sound of the trumpet. -- 2 samuel 6:15
.
Then it happened as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. -- 2 samuel 6:16
.
So they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. -- 2 samuel 6:17
.
When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offering, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. -- 2 samuel 6:18
.
Further, he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a cake of bread and one of dates and one of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed each to his house. -- 2 samuel 6:19
.
But when David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How the king of Israel distinguished himself today! He uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants' maids as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!" -- 2 samuel 6:20
.
So David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel; therefore I will celebrate before the LORD. -- 2 samuel 6:21
.
"I will be more lightly esteemed than this and will be humble in my own eyes, but with the maids of whom you have spoken, with them I will be distinguished." -- 2 samuel 6:22
.
Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death. -- 2 samuel 6:23
.
Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the LORD had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, -- 2 samuel 7:1
.
that the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains." -- 2 samuel 7:2
.
Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your mind, for the LORD is with you." -- 2 samuel 7:3
.
But in the same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying, -- 2 samuel 7:4
.
"Go and say to My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD, "Are you the one who should build Me a house to dwell in? -- 2 samuel 7:5
.
"For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt, even to this day; but I have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle. -- 2 samuel 7:6
.
"Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'"' -- 2 samuel 7:7
.
"Now therefore, thus you shall say to My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel. -- 2 samuel 7:8
.
"I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth. -- 2 samuel 7:9
.
"I will also appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will the wicked afflict them any more as formerly, -- 2 samuel 7:10
.
even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that the LORD will make a house for you. -- 2 samuel 7:11
.
"When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. -- 2 samuel 7:12
.
"He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. -- 2 samuel 7:13
.
"I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men, -- 2 samuel 7:14
.
but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. -- 2 samuel 7:15
.
"Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever."'" -- 2 samuel 7:16
.
In accordance with all these words and all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. -- 2 samuel 7:17
.
Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD, and he said, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far? -- 2 samuel 7:18
.
"And yet this was insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord GOD, for You have spoken also of the house of Your servant concerning the distant future. And this is the custom of man, O Lord GOD. -- 2 samuel 7:19
.
"Again what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord GOD! -- 2 samuel 7:20
.
"For the sake of Your word, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness to let Your servant know. -- 2 samuel 7:21
.
"For this reason You are great, O Lord GOD; for there is none like You, and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. -- 2 samuel 7:22
.
"And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself, and to do a great thing for You and awesome things for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, from nations and their gods? -- 2 samuel 7:23
.
"For You have established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your own people forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God. -- 2 samuel 7:24
.
"Now therefore, O LORD God, the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house, confirm it forever, and do as You have spoken, -- 2 samuel 7:25
.
that Your name may be magnified forever, by saying, 'The LORD of hosts is God over Israel'; and may the house of Your servant David be established before You. -- 2 samuel 7:26
.
"For You, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made a revelation to Your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house'; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to You. -- 2 samuel 7:27
.
"Now, O Lord GOD, You are God, and Your words are truth, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant. -- 2 samuel 7:28
.
"Now therefore, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have spoken; and with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever." -- 2 samuel 7:29
.
Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them; and David took control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines. -- 2 samuel 8:1
.
He defeated Moab, and measured them with the line, making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute. -- 2 samuel 8:2
.
Then David defeated Hadadezer, the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went to restore his rule at the River. -- 2 samuel 8:3
.
David captured from him 1,horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers; and David hamstrung the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for 100 chariots. -- 2 samuel 8:4
.
When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David killed 22,Arameans. -- 2 samuel 8:5
.
Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. -- 2 samuel 8:6
.
David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 8:7
.
From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a very large amount of bronze. -- 2 samuel 8:8
.
Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, -- 2 samuel 8:9
.
Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold and of bronze. -- 2 samuel 8:10
.
King David also dedicated these to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he had subdued: -- 2 samuel 8:11
.
from Aram and Moab and the sons of Ammon and the Philistines and Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. -- 2 samuel 8:12
.
So David made a name for himself when he returned from killing 18,Arameans in the Valley of Salt. -- 2 samuel 8:13
.
He put garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. -- 2 samuel 8:14
.
So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and righteousness for all his people. -- 2 samuel 8:15
.
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder. -- 2 samuel 8:16
.
Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Seraiah was secretary. -- 2 samuel 8:17
.
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers. -- 2 samuel 8:18
.
Then David said, "Is there yet anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?" -- 2 samuel 9:1
.
Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" And he said, "I am your servant." -- 2 samuel 9:2
.
The king said, "Is there not yet anyone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God?" And Ziba said to the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan who is crippled in both feet." -- 2 samuel 9:3
.
So the king said to him, "Where is he?" And Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo-debar." -- 2 samuel 9:4
.
Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. -- 2 samuel 9:5
.
Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, "Mephibosheth." And he said, "Here is your servant!" -- 2 samuel 9:6
.
David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall eat at my table regularly." -- 2 samuel 9:7
.
Again he prostrated himself and said, "What is your servant, that you should regard a dead dog like me?" -- 2 samuel 9:8
.
Then the king called Saul's servant Ziba and said to him, "All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's grandson. -- 2 samuel 9:9
.
"You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in the produce so that your master's grandson may have food; nevertheless Mephibosheth your master's grandson shall eat at my table regularly." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. -- 2 samuel 9:10
.
Then Ziba said to the king, "According to all that my lord the king commands his servant so your servant will do." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table as one of the king's sons. -- 2 samuel 9:11
.
Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth. -- 2 samuel 9:12
.
So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate at the king's table regularly. Now he was lame in both feet. -- 2 samuel 9:13
.
Now it happened afterwards that the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son became king in his place. -- 2 samuel 10:1
.
Then David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent some of his servants to console him concerning his father. But when David's servants came to the land of the Ammonites, -- 2 samuel 10:2
.
the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent consolers to you? Has David not sent his servants to you in order to search the city, to spy it out and overthrow it?" -- 2 samuel 10:3
.
So Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away. -- 2 samuel 10:4
.
When they told it to David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and then return." -- 2 samuel 10:5
.
Now when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, 20,foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob with 12,000 men. -- 2 samuel 10:6
.
When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men. -- 2 samuel 10:7
.
The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, while the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field. -- 2 samuel 10:8
.
Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Arameans. -- 2 samuel 10:9
.
But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the sons of Ammon. -- 2 samuel 10:10
.
He said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help you. -- 2 samuel 10:11
.
"Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what is good in His sight." -- 2 samuel 10:12
.
So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. -- 2 samuel 10:13
.
When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they also fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 10:14
.
When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. -- 2 samuel 10:15
.
And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam; and Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer led them. -- 2 samuel 10:16
.
Now when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans arrayed themselves to meet David and fought against him. -- 2 samuel 10:17
.
But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed charioteers of the Arameans and 40,000 horsemen and struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there. -- 2 samuel 10:18
.
When all the kings, servants of Hadadezer, saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the sons of Ammon anymore. -- 2 samuel 10:19
.
Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel, and they destroyed the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 11:1
.
Now when evening came David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king's house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance. -- 2 samuel 11:2
.
So David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?" -- 2 samuel 11:3
.
David sent messengers and took her, and when she came to him, he lay with her; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house. -- 2 samuel 11:4
.
The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, "I am pregnant." -- 2 samuel 11:5
.
Then David sent to Joab, saying, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David. -- 2 samuel 11:6
.
When Uriah came to him, David asked concerning the welfare of Joab and the people and the state of the war. -- 2 samuel 11:7
.
Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house, and wash your feet." And Uriah went out of the king's house, and a present from the king was sent out after him. -- 2 samuel 11:8
.
But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. -- 2 samuel 11:9
.
Now when they told David, saying, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?" -- 2 samuel 11:10
.
Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing." -- 2 samuel 11:11
.
Then David said to Uriah, "Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you go." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. -- 2 samuel 11:12
.
Now David called him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with his lord's servants, but he did not go down to his house. -- 2 samuel 11:13
.
Now in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah. -- 2 samuel 11:14
.
He had written in the letter, saying, "Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die." -- 2 samuel 11:15
.
So it was as Joab kept watch on the city, that he put Uriah at the place where he knew there were valiant men. -- 2 samuel 11:16
.
The men of the city went out and fought against Joab, and some of the people among David's servants fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died. -- 2 samuel 11:17
.
Then Joab sent and reported to David all the events of the war. -- 2 samuel 11:18
.
He charged the messenger, saying, "When you have finished telling all the events of the war to the king, -- 2 samuel 11:19
.
and if it happens that the king's wrath rises and he says to you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? -- 2 samuel 11:20
.
'Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?'--then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'" -- 2 samuel 11:21
.
So the messenger departed and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to tell. -- 2 samuel 11:22
.
The messenger said to David, "The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate. -- 2 samuel 11:23
.
"Moreover, the archers shot at your servants from the wall; so some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead." -- 2 samuel 11:24
.
Then David said to the messenger, "Thus you shall say to Joab, 'Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle against the city stronger and overthrow it'; and so encourage him." -- 2 samuel 11:25
.
Now when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. -- 2 samuel 11:26
.
When the time of mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife; then she bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the LORD. -- 2 samuel 11:27
.
Then the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him and said, "There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor. -- 2 samuel 12:1
.
"The rich man had a great many flocks and herds. -- 2 samuel 12:2
.
"But the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb Which he bought and nourished; And it grew up together with him and his children. It would eat of his bread and drink of his cup and lie in his bosom, And was like a daughter to him. -- 2 samuel 12:3
.
"Now a traveler came to the rich man, And he was unwilling to take from his own flock or his own herd, To prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him; Rather he took the poor man's ewe lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him." -- 2 samuel 12:4
.
Then David's anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, surely the man who has done this deserves to die. -- 2 samuel 12:5
.
"He must make restitution for the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and had no compassion." -- 2 samuel 12:6
.
Nathan then said to David, "You are the man! Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'It is I who anointed you king over Israel and it is I who delivered you from the hand of Saul. -- 2 samuel 12:7
.
'I also gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your care, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added to you many more things like these! -- 2 samuel 12:8
.
'Why have you despised the word of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon. -- 2 samuel 12:9
.
'Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.' -- 2 samuel 12:10
.
"Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own household; I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight. -- 2 samuel 12:11
.
'Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and under the sun.'" -- 2 samuel 12:12
.
Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." And Nathan said to David, "The LORD also has taken away your sin; you shall not die. -- 2 samuel 12:13
.
"However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die." -- 2 samuel 12:14
.
So Nathan went to his house. Then the LORD struck the child that Uriah's widow bore to David, so that he was very sick. -- 2 samuel 12:15
.
David therefore inquired of God for the child; and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground. -- 2 samuel 12:16
.
The elders of his household stood beside him in order to raise him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them. -- 2 samuel 12:17
.
Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, "Behold, while the child was still alive, we spoke to him and he did not listen to our voice. How then can we tell him that the child is dead, since he might do himself harm!" -- 2 samuel 12:18
.
But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; so David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" And they said, "He is dead." -- 2 samuel 12:19
.
So David arose from the ground, washed, anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he came into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he came to his own house, and when he requested, they set food before him and he ate. -- 2 samuel 12:20
.
Then his servants said to him, "What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept; but when the child died, you arose and ate food." -- 2 samuel 12:21
.
He said, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows, the LORD may be gracious to me, that the child may live.' -- 2 samuel 12:22
.
"But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me." -- 2 samuel 12:23
.
Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her; and she gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. Now the LORD loved him -- 2 samuel 12:24
.
and sent word through Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah for the LORD'S sake. -- 2 samuel 12:25
.
Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon and captured the royal city. -- 2 samuel 12:26
.
Joab sent messengers to David and said, "I have fought against Rabbah, I have even captured the city of waters. -- 2 samuel 12:27
.
"Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and camp against the city and capture it, or I will capture the city myself and it will be named after me." -- 2 samuel 12:28
.
So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah, fought against it and captured it. -- 2 samuel 12:29
.
Then he took the crown of their king from his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city in great amounts. -- 2 samuel 12:30
.
He also brought out the people who were in it, and set them under saws, sharp iron instruments, and iron axes, and made them pass through the brickkiln. And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 12:31
.
Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David loved her. -- 2 samuel 13:1
.
Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her. -- 2 samuel 13:2
.
But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man. -- 2 samuel 13:3
.
He said to him, "O son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?" Then Amnon said to him, "I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom." -- 2 samuel 13:4
.
Jonadab then said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill; when your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me some food to eat, and let her prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat from her hand.'" -- 2 samuel 13:5
.
So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand." -- 2 samuel 13:6
.
Then David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, "Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him." -- 2 samuel 13:7
.
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was lying down. And she took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. -- 2 samuel 13:8
.
She took the pan and dished them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, "Have everyone go out from me." So everyone went out from him. -- 2 samuel 13:9
.
Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand." So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon. -- 2 samuel 13:10
.
When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister." -- 2 samuel 13:11
.
But she answered him, "No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing! -- 2 samuel 13:12
.
"As for me, where could I get rid of my reproach? And as for you, you will be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you." -- 2 samuel 13:13
.
However, he would not listen to her; since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her. -- 2 samuel 13:14
.
Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, "Get up, go away!" -- 2 samuel 13:15
.
But she said to him, "No, because this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done to me!" Yet he would not listen to her. -- 2 samuel 13:16
.
Then he called his young man who attended him and said, "Now throw this woman out of my presence, and lock the door behind her." -- 2 samuel 13:17
.
Now she had on a long-sleeved garment; for in this manner the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her. -- 2 samuel 13:18
.
Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment which was on her; and she put her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went. -- 2 samuel 13:19
.
Then Absalom her brother said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is your brother; do not take this matter to heart." So Tamar remained and was desolate in her brother Absalom's house. -- 2 samuel 13:20
.
Now when King David heard of all these matters, he was very angry. -- 2 samuel 13:21
.
But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar. -- 2 samuel 13:22
.
Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons. -- 2 samuel 13:23
.
Absalom came to the king and said, "Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant." -- 2 samuel 13:24
.
But the king said to Absalom, "No, my son, we should not all go, for we will be burdensome to you." Although he urged him, he would not go, but blessed him. -- 2 samuel 13:25
.
Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us." And the king said to him, "Why should he go with you?" -- 2 samuel 13:26
.
But when Absalom urged him, he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. -- 2 samuel 13:27
.
Absalom commanded his servants, saying, "See now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then put him to death. Do not fear; have not I myself commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant." -- 2 samuel 13:28
.
The servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled. -- 2 samuel 13:29
.
Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying, "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left." -- 2 samuel 13:30
.
Then the king arose, tore his clothes and lay on the ground; and all his servants were standing by with clothes torn. -- 2 samuel 13:31
.
Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, responded, "Do not let my lord suppose they have put to death all the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead; because by the intent of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he violated his sister Tamar. -- 2 samuel 13:32
.
"Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart, namely, 'all the king's sons are dead,' for only Amnon is dead." -- 2 samuel 13:33
.
Now Absalom had fled. And the young man who was the watchman raised his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. -- 2 samuel 13:34
.
Jonadab said to the king, "Behold, the king's sons have come; according to your servant's word, so it happened." -- 2 samuel 13:35
.
As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king's sons came and lifted their voices and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly. -- 2 samuel 13:36
.
Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. -- 2 samuel 13:37
.
So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there three years. -- 2 samuel 13:38
.
The heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead. -- 2 samuel 13:39
.
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was inclined toward Absalom. -- 2 samuel 14:1
.
So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there and said to her, "Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments now, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be like a woman who has been mourning for the dead many days; -- 2 samuel 14:2
.
then go to the king and speak to him in this manner." So Joab put the words in her mouth. -- 2 samuel 14:3
.
Now when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said, "Help, O king." -- 2 samuel 14:4
.
The king said to her, "What is your trouble?" And she answered, "Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead. -- 2 samuel 14:5
.
"Your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled together in the field, and there was no one to separate them, so one struck the other and killed him. -- 2 samuel 14:6
.
"Now behold, the whole family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, 'Hand over the one who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and destroy the heir also.' Thus they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth." -- 2 samuel 14:7
.
Then the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you." -- 2 samuel 14:8
.
The woman of Tekoa said to the king, "O my lord, the king, the iniquity is on me and my father's house, but the king and his throne are guiltless." -- 2 samuel 14:9
.
So the king said, "Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore." -- 2 samuel 14:10
.
Then she said, "Please let the king remember the LORD your God, so that the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy my son." And he said, "As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground." -- 2 samuel 14:11
.
Then the woman said, "Please let your maidservant speak a word to my lord the king." And he said, "Speak." -- 2 samuel 14:12
.
The woman said, "Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one. -- 2 samuel 14:13
.
"For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away life, but plans ways so that the banished one will not be cast out from him. -- 2 samuel 14:14
.
"Now the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king is that the people have made me afraid; so your maidservant said, 'Let me now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his maidservant. -- 2 samuel 14:15
.
'For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy both me and my son from the inheritance of God.' -- 2 samuel 14:16
.
"Then your maidservant said, 'Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.'" -- 2 samuel 14:17
.
Then the king answered and said to the woman, "Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you." And the woman said, "Let my lord the king please speak." -- 2 samuel 14:18
.
So the king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" And the woman replied, "As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant; -- 2 samuel 14:19
.
in order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is in the earth." -- 2 samuel 14:20
.
Then the king said to Joab, "Behold now, I will surely do this thing; go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom." -- 2 samuel 14:21
.
Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself and blessed the king; then Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, O my lord, the king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant." -- 2 samuel 14:22
.
So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 14:23
.
However the king said, "Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face." So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king's face. -- 2 samuel 14:24
.
Now in all Israel was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no defect in him. -- 2 samuel 14:25
.
When he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut it, for it was heavy on him so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at shekels by the king's weight. -- 2 samuel 14:26
.
To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance. -- 2 samuel 14:27
.
Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king's face. -- 2 samuel 14:28
.
Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent again a second time, but he would not come. -- 2 samuel 14:29
.
Therefore he said to his servants, "See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire. -- 2 samuel 14:30
.
Then Joab arose, came to Absalom at his house and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?" -- 2 samuel 14:31
.
Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent for you, saying, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me still to be there."' Now therefore, let me see the king's face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death." -- 2 samuel 14:32
.
So when Joab came to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. Thus he came to the king and prostrated himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom. -- 2 samuel 14:33
.
Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses and fifty men as runners before him. -- 2 samuel 15:1
.
Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way to the gate; and when any man had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, "From what city are you?" And he would say, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel." -- 2 samuel 15:2
.
Then Absalom would say to him, "See, your claims are good and right, but no man listens to you on the part of the king." -- 2 samuel 15:3
.
Moreover, Absalom would say, "Oh that one would appoint me judge in the land, then every man who has any suit or cause could come to me and I would give him justice." -- 2 samuel 15:4
.
And when a man came near to prostrate himself before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. -- 2 samuel 15:5
.
In this manner Absalom dealt with all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole away the hearts of the men of Israel. -- 2 samuel 15:6
.
Now it came about at the end of forty years that Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron. -- 2 samuel 15:7
.
"For your servant vowed a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram, saying, 'If the LORD shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.'" -- 2 samuel 15:8
.
The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose and went to Hebron. -- 2 samuel 15:9
.
But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'" -- 2 samuel 15:10
.
Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who were invited and went innocently, and they did not know anything. -- 2 samuel 15:11
.
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom. -- 2 samuel 15:12
.
Then a messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom." -- 2 samuel 15:13
.
David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise and let us flee, for otherwise none of us will escape from Absalom. Go in haste, or he will overtake us quickly and bring down calamity on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword." -- 2 samuel 15:14
.
Then the king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses." -- 2 samuel 15:15
.
So the king went out and all his household with him. But the king left ten concubines to keep the house. -- 2 samuel 15:16
.
The king went out and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house. -- 2 samuel 15:17
.
Now all his servants passed on beside him, all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed on before the king. -- 2 samuel 15:18
.
Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why will you also go with us? Return and remain with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile; return to your own place. -- 2 samuel 15:19
.
"You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander with us, while I go where I will? Return and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you." -- 2 samuel 15:20
.
But Ittai answered the king and said, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there also your servant will be." -- 2 samuel 15:21
.
Therefore David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." So Ittai the Gittite passed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. -- 2 samuel 15:22
.
While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people passed over. The king also passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness. -- 2 samuel 15:23
.
Now behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up until all the people had finished passing from the city. -- 2 samuel 15:24
.
The king said to Zadok, "Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the sight of the LORD, then He will bring me back again and show me both it and His habitation. -- 2 samuel 15:25
.
"But if He should say thus, 'I have no delight in you,' behold, here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him." -- 2 samuel 15:26
.
The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. -- 2 samuel 15:27
.
"See, I am going to wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me." -- 2 samuel 15:28
.
Therefore Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there. -- 2 samuel 15:29
.
And David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went, and his head was covered and he walked barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his head and went up weeping as they went. -- 2 samuel 15:30
.
Now someone told David, saying, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." And David said, "O LORD, I pray, make the counsel of Ahithophel foolishness." -- 2 samuel 15:31
.
It happened as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn and dust on his head. -- 2 samuel 15:32
.
David said to him, "If you pass over with me, then you will be a burden to me. -- 2 samuel 15:33
.
"But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so I will now be your servant,' then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me. -- 2 samuel 15:34
.
"Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king's house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. -- 2 samuel 15:35
.
"Behold their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear." -- 2 samuel 15:36
.
So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 15:37
.
Now when David had passed a little beyond the summit, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a jug of wine. -- 2 samuel 16:1
.
The king said to Ziba, "Why do you have these?" And Ziba said, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, for whoever is faint in the wilderness to drink." -- 2 samuel 16:2
.
Then the king said, "And where is your master's son?" And Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.'" -- 2 samuel 16:3
.
So the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours." And Ziba said, "I prostrate myself; let me find favor in your sight, O my lord, the king!" -- 2 samuel 16:4
.
When King David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out cursing continually as he came. -- 2 samuel 16:5
.
He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were at his right hand and at his left. -- 2 samuel 16:6
.
Thus Shimei said when he cursed, "Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, and worthless fellow! -- 2 samuel 16:7
.
"The LORD has returned upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. And behold, you are taken in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!" -- 2 samuel 16:8
.
Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over now and cut off his head." -- 2 samuel 16:9
.
But the king said, "What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the LORD has told him, 'Curse David,' then who shall say, 'Why have you done so?'" -- 2 samuel 16:10
.
Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Behold, my son who came out from me seeks my life; how much more now this Benjamite? Let him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him. -- 2 samuel 16:11
.
"Perhaps the LORD will look on my affliction and return good to me instead of his cursing this day." -- 2 samuel 16:12
.
So David and his men went on the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside parallel with him and as he went he cursed and cast stones and threw dust at him. -- 2 samuel 16:13
.
The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary and he refreshed himself there. -- 2 samuel 16:14
.
Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. -- 2 samuel 16:15
.
Now it came about when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!" -- 2 samuel 16:16
.
Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?" -- 2 samuel 16:17
.
Then Hushai said to Absalom, "No! For whom the LORD, this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain. -- 2 samuel 16:18
.
"Besides, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so I will be in your presence." -- 2 samuel 16:19
.
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your advice. What shall we do?" -- 2 samuel 16:20
.
Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father. The hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened." -- 2 samuel 16:21
.
So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. -- 2 samuel 16:22
.
The advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if one inquired of the word of God; so was all the advice of Ahithophel regarded by both David and Absalom. -- 2 samuel 16:23
.
Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Please let me choose 12,men that I may arise and pursue David tonight. -- 2 samuel 17:1
.
"I will come upon him while he is weary and exhausted and terrify him, so that all the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king alone, -- 2 samuel 17:2
.
and I will bring back all the people to you. The return of everyone depends on the man you seek; then all the people will be at peace." -- 2 samuel 17:3
.
So the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel. -- 2 samuel 17:4
.
Then Absalom said, "Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say." -- 2 samuel 17:5
.
When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom said to him, "Ahithophel has spoken thus. Shall we carry out his plan? If not, you speak." -- 2 samuel 17:6
.
So Hushai said to Absalom, "This time the advice that Ahithophel has given is not good." -- 2 samuel 17:7
.
Moreover, Hushai said, "You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men and they are fierce, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. And your father is an expert in warfare, and will not spend the night with the people. -- 2 samuel 17:8
.
"Behold, he has now hidden himself in one of the caves or in another place; and it will be when he falls on them at the first attack, that whoever hears it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.' -- 2 samuel 17:9
.
"And even the one who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will completely lose heart; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men. -- 2 samuel 17:10
.
"But I counsel that all Israel be surely gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea in abundance, and that you personally go into battle. -- 2 samuel 17:11
.
"So we shall come to him in one of the places where he can be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him, not even one will be left. -- 2 samuel 17:12
.
"If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the valley until not even a small stone is found there." -- 2 samuel 17:13
.
Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the LORD had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring calamity on Absalom. -- 2 samuel 17:14
.
Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "This is what Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have counseled. -- 2 samuel 17:15
.
"Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, 'Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means cross over, or else the king and all the people who are with him will be destroyed.'" -- 2 samuel 17:16
.
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a maidservant would go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David, for they could not be seen entering the city. -- 2 samuel 17:17
.
But a lad did see them and told Absalom; so the two of them departed quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it. -- 2 samuel 17:18
.
And the woman took a covering and spread it over the well's mouth and scattered grain on it, so that nothing was known. -- 2 samuel 17:19
.
Then Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And the woman said to them, "They have crossed the brook of water." And when they searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 17:20
.
It came about after they had departed that they came up out of the well and went and told King David; and they said to David, "Arise and cross over the water quickly for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you." -- 2 samuel 17:21
.
Then David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed the Jordan; and by dawn not even one remained who had not crossed the Jordan. -- 2 samuel 17:22
.
Now when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and arose and went to his home, to his city, and set his house in order, and strangled himself; thus he died and was buried in the grave of his father. -- 2 samuel 17:23
.
Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. -- 2 samuel 17:24
.
Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother. -- 2 samuel 17:25
.
And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. -- 2 samuel 17:26
.
Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, -- 2 samuel 17:27
.
brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans, lentils, parched seeds, -- 2 samuel 17:28
.
honey, curds, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and for the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, "The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness." -- 2 samuel 17:29
.
Then David numbered the people who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. -- 2 samuel 18:1
.
David sent the people out, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, "I myself will surely go out with you also." -- 2 samuel 18:2
.
But the people said, "You should not go out; for if we indeed flee, they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you be ready to help us from the city." -- 2 samuel 18:3
.
Then the king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you I will do." So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and thousands. -- 2 samuel 18:4
.
The king charged Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard when the king charged all the commanders concerning Absalom. -- 2 samuel 18:5
.
Then the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. -- 2 samuel 18:6
.
The people of Israel were defeated there before the servants of David, and the slaughter there that day was great, 20,men. -- 2 samuel 18:7
.
For the battle there was spread over the whole countryside, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. -- 2 samuel 18:8
.
Now Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. For Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak. And his head caught fast in the oak, so he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him kept going. -- 2 samuel 18:9
.
When a certain man saw it, he told Joab and said, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak." -- 2 samuel 18:10
.
Then Joab said to the man who had told him, "Now behold, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? And I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt." -- 2 samuel 18:11
.
The man said to Joab, "Even if I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I would not put out my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, 'Protect for me the young man Absalom!' -- 2 samuel 18:12
.
"Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof." -- 2 samuel 18:13
.
Then Joab said, "I will not waste time here with you." So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. -- 2 samuel 18:14
.
And ten young men who carried Joab's armor gathered around and struck Absalom and killed him. -- 2 samuel 18:15
.
Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the people. -- 2 samuel 18:16
.
They took Absalom and cast him into a deep pit in the forest and erected over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his tent. -- 2 samuel 18:17
.
Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar which is in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to preserve my name." So he named the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day. -- 2 samuel 18:18
.
Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Please let me run and bring the king news that the LORD has freed him from the hand of his enemies." -- 2 samuel 18:19
.
But Joab said to him, "You are not the man to carry news this day, but you shall carry news another day; however, you shall carry no news today because the king's son is dead." -- 2 samuel 18:20
.
Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran. -- 2 samuel 18:21
.
Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once more to Joab, "But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite." And Joab said, "Why would you run, my son, since you will have no reward for going?" -- 2 samuel 18:22
.
"But whatever happens," he said, "I will run." So he said to him, "Run." Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and passed up the Cushite. -- 2 samuel 18:23
.
Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running by himself. -- 2 samuel 18:24
.
The watchman called and told the king. And the king said, "If he is by himself there is good news in his mouth." And he came nearer and nearer. -- 2 samuel 18:25
.
Then the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, "Behold, another man running by himself." And the king said, "This one also is bringing good news." -- 2 samuel 18:26
.
The watchman said, "I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok." And the king said, "This is a good man and comes with good news." -- 2 samuel 18:27
.
Ahimaaz called and said to the king, "All is well." And he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. And he said, "Blessed is the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king." -- 2 samuel 18:28
.
The king said, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" And Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant, and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was." -- 2 samuel 18:29
.
Then the king said, "Turn aside and stand here." So he turned aside and stood still. -- 2 samuel 18:30
.
Behold, the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said, "Let my lord the king receive good news, for the LORD has freed you this day from the hand of all those who rose up against you." -- 2 samuel 18:31
.
Then the king said to the Cushite, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" And the Cushite answered, "Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you for evil, be as that young man!" -- 2 samuel 18:32
.
The king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And thus he said as he walked, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!" -- 2 samuel 18:33
.
Then it was told Joab, "Behold, the king is weeping and mourns for Absalom." -- 2 samuel 19:1
.
The victory that day was turned to mourning for all the people, for the people heard it said that day, "The king is grieved for his son." -- 2 samuel 19:2
.
So the people went by stealth into the city that day, as people who are humiliated steal away when they flee in battle. -- 2 samuel 19:3
.
The king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!" -- 2 samuel 19:4
.
Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, "Today you have covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who today have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines, -- 2 samuel 19:5
.
by loving those who hate you, and by hating those who love you. For you have shown today that princes and servants are nothing to you; for I know this day that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased. -- 2 samuel 19:6
.
"Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, surely not a man will pass the night with you, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now." -- 2 samuel 19:7
.
So the king arose and sat in the gate. When they told all the people, saying, "Behold, the king is sitting in the gate," then all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled, each to his tent. -- 2 samuel 19:8
.
All the people were quarreling throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. -- 2 samuel 19:9
.
"However, Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now then, why are you silent about bringing the king back?" -- 2 samuel 19:10
.
Then King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, "Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the word of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house? -- 2 samuel 19:11
.
'You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?' -- 2 samuel 19:12
.
"Say to Amasa, 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you will not be commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.'" -- 2 samuel 19:13
.
Thus he turned the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent word to the king, saying, "Return, you and all your servants." -- 2 samuel 19:14
.
The king then returned and came as far as the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal in order to go to meet the king, to bring the king across the Jordan. -- 2 samuel 19:15
.
Then Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David. -- 2 samuel 19:16
.
There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, with Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they rushed to the Jordan before the king. -- 2 samuel 19:17
.
Then they kept crossing the ford to bring over the king's household, and to do what was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan. -- 2 samuel 19:18
.
So he said to the king, "Let not my lord consider me guilty, nor remember what your servant did wrong on the day when my lord the king came out from Jerusalem, so that the king would take it to heart. -- 2 samuel 19:19
.
"For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore behold, I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king." -- 2 samuel 19:20
.
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah said, "Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?" -- 2 samuel 19:21
.
David then said, "What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be an adversary to me? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? For do I not know that I am king over Israel today?" -- 2 samuel 19:22
.
The king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." Thus the king swore to him. -- 2 samuel 19:23
.
Then Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. -- 2 samuel 19:24
.
It was when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, "Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?" -- 2 samuel 19:25
.
So he answered, "O my lord, the king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said, 'I will saddle a donkey for myself that I may ride on it and go with the king,' because your servant is lame. -- 2 samuel 19:26
.
"Moreover, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is like the angel of God, therefore do what is good in your sight. -- 2 samuel 19:27
.
"For all my father's household was nothing but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right do I have yet that I should complain anymore to the king?" -- 2 samuel 19:28
.
So the king said to him, "Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have decided, 'You and Ziba shall divide the land.'" -- 2 samuel 19:29
.
Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has come safely to his own house." -- 2 samuel 19:30
.
Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan. -- 2 samuel 19:31
.
Now Barzillai was very old, being eighty years old; and he had sustained the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man. -- 2 samuel 19:32
.
The king said to Barzillai, "You cross over with me and I will sustain you in Jerusalem with me." -- 2 samuel 19:33
.
But Barzillai said to the king, "How long have I yet to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? -- 2 samuel 19:34
.
"I am now eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I hear anymore the voice of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? -- 2 samuel 19:35
.
"Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me with this reward? -- 2 samuel 19:36
.
"Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham, let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight." -- 2 samuel 19:37
.
The king answered, "Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight; and whatever you require of me, I will do for you." -- 2 samuel 19:38
.
All the people crossed over the Jordan and the king crossed too. The king then kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place. -- 2 samuel 19:39
.
Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king. -- 2 samuel 19:40
.
And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, "Why had our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household and all David's men with him over the Jordan?" -- 2 samuel 19:41
.
Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense, or has anything been taken for us?" -- 2 samuel 19:42
.
But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, "We have ten parts in the king, therefore we also have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt? Was it not our advice first to bring back our king?" Yet the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel. -- 2 samuel 19:43
.
Now a worthless fellow happened to be there whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet and said, "We have no portion in David, Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; Every man to his tents, O Israel!" -- 2 samuel 20:1
.
So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah remained steadfast to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 20:2
.
Then David came to his house at Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and placed them under guard and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as widows. -- 2 samuel 20:3
.
Then the king said to Amasa, "Call out the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself." -- 2 samuel 20:4
.
So Amasa went to call out the men of Judah, but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him. -- 2 samuel 20:5
.
And David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord's servants and pursue him, so that he does not find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight." -- 2 samuel 20:6
.
So Joab's men went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. -- 2 samuel 20:7
.
When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened at his waist; and as he went forward, it fell out. -- 2 samuel 20:8
.
Joab said to Amasa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. -- 2 samuel 20:9
.
But Amasa was not on guard against the sword which was in Joab's hand so he struck him in the belly with it and poured out his inward parts on the ground, and did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. -- 2 samuel 20:10
.
Now there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, "Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab." -- 2 samuel 20:11
.
But Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still. -- 2 samuel 20:12
.
As soon as he was removed from the highway, all the men passed on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. -- 2 samuel 20:13
.
Now he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, even Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they were gathered together and also went after him. -- 2 samuel 20:14
.
They came and besieged him in Abel Beth-maacah, and they cast up a siege ramp against the city, and it stood by the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction in order to topple the wall. -- 2 samuel 20:15
.
Then a wise woman called from the city, "Hear, hear! Please tell Joab, 'Come here that I may speak with you.'" -- 2 samuel 20:16
.
So he approached her, and the woman said, "Are you Joab?" And he answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your maidservant." And he answered, "I am listening." -- 2 samuel 20:17
.
Then she spoke, saying, "Formerly they used to say, 'They will surely ask advice at Abel,' and thus they ended the dispute. -- 2 samuel 20:18
.
"I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city, even a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?" -- 2 samuel 20:19
.
Joab replied, "Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy! -- 2 samuel 20:20
.
"Such is not the case. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against King David. Only hand him over, and I will depart from the city." And the woman said to Joab, "Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall." -- 2 samuel 20:21
.
Then the woman wisely came to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Joab also returned to the king at Jerusalem. -- 2 samuel 20:22
.
Now Joab was over the whole army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; -- 2 samuel 20:23
.
and Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; -- 2 samuel 20:24
.
and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; -- 2 samuel 20:25
.
and Ira the Jairite was also a priest to David. -- 2 samuel 20:26
.
Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the presence of the LORD. And the LORD said, "It is for Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death." -- 2 samuel 21:1
.
So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel made a covenant with them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah). -- 2 samuel 21:2
.
Thus David said to the Gibeonites, "What should I do for you? And how can I make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?" -- 2 samuel 21:3
.
Then the Gibeonites said to him, "We have no concern of silver or gold with Saul or his house, nor is it for us to put any man to death in Israel." And he said, "I will do for you whatever you say." -- 2 samuel 21:4
.
So they said to the king, "The man who consumed us and who planned to exterminate us from remaining within any border of Israel, -- 2 samuel 21:5
.
let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD." And the king said, "I will give them." -- 2 samuel 21:6
.
But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the LORD which was between them, between David and Saul's son Jonathan. -- 2 samuel 21:7
.
So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Armoni and Mephibosheth whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. -- 2 samuel 21:8
.
Then he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the LORD, so that the seven of them fell together; and they were put to death in the first days of harvest at the beginning of barley harvest. -- 2 samuel 21:9
.
And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until it rained on them from the sky; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night. -- 2 samuel 21:10
.
When it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done, -- 2 samuel 21:11
.
then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines struck down Saul in Gilboa. -- 2 samuel 21:12
.
He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged. -- 2 samuel 21:13
.
They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of Kish his father; thus they did all that the king commanded, and after that God was moved by prayer for the land. -- 2 samuel 21:14
.
Now when the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David went down and his servants with him; and as they fought against the Philistines, David became weary. -- 2 samuel 21:15
.
Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, was girded with a new sword, and he intended to kill David. -- 2 samuel 21:16
.
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, "You shall not go out again with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel." -- 2 samuel 21:17
.
Now it came about after this that there was war again with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was among the descendants of the giant. -- 2 samuel 21:18
.
There was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. -- 2 samuel 21:19
.
There was war at Gath again, where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also had been born to the giant. -- 2 samuel 21:20
.
When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down. -- 2 samuel 21:21
.
These four were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. -- 2 samuel 21:22
.
And David spoke the words of this song to the LORD in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. -- 2 samuel 22:1
.
He said, "The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; -- 2 samuel 22:2
.
My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, You save me from violence. -- 2 samuel 22:3
.
"I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies. -- 2 samuel 22:4
.
"For the waves of death encompassed me; The torrents of destruction overwhelmed me; -- 2 samuel 22:5
.
The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me. -- 2 samuel 22:6
.
"In my distress I called upon the LORD, Yes, I cried to my God; And from His temple He heard my voice, And my cry for help came into His ears. -- 2 samuel 22:7
.
"Then the earth shook and quaked, The foundations of heaven were trembling And were shaken, because He was angry. -- 2 samuel 22:8
.
"Smoke went up out of His nostrils, Fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it. -- 2 samuel 22:9
.
"He bowed the heavens also, and came down With thick darkness under His feet. -- 2 samuel 22:10
.
"And He rode on a cherub and flew; And He appeared on the wings of the wind. -- 2 samuel 22:11
.
"And He made darkness canopies around Him, A mass of waters, thick clouds of the sky. -- 2 samuel 22:12
.
"From the brightness before Him Coals of fire were kindled. -- 2 samuel 22:13
.
"The LORD thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered His voice. -- 2 samuel 22:14
.
"And He sent out arrows, and scattered them, Lightning, and routed them. -- 2 samuel 22:15
.
"Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare By the rebuke of the LORD, At the blast of the breath of His nostrils. -- 2 samuel 22:16
.
"He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. -- 2 samuel 22:17
.
"He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me, for they were too strong for me. -- 2 samuel 22:18
.
"They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my support. -- 2 samuel 22:19
.
"He also brought me forth into a broad place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me. -- 2 samuel 22:20
.
"The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me. -- 2 samuel 22:21
.
"For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not acted wickedly against my God. -- 2 samuel 22:22
.
"For all His ordinances were before me, And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them. -- 2 samuel 22:23
.
"I was also blameless toward Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity. -- 2 samuel 22:24
.
"Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness before His eyes. -- 2 samuel 22:25
.
"With the kind You show Yourself kind, With the blameless You show Yourself blameless; -- 2 samuel 22:26
.
With the pure You show Yourself pure, And with the perverted You show Yourself astute. -- 2 samuel 22:27
.
"And You save an afflicted people; But Your eyes are on the haughty whom You abase. -- 2 samuel 22:28
.
"For You are my lamp, O LORD; And the LORD illumines my darkness. -- 2 samuel 22:29
.
"For by You I can run upon a troop; By my God I can leap over a wall. -- 2 samuel 22:30
.
"As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tested; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. -- 2 samuel 22:31
.
"For who is God, besides the LORD? And who is a rock, besides our God? -- 2 samuel 22:32
.
"God is my strong fortress; And He sets the blameless in His way. -- 2 samuel 22:33
.
"He makes my feet like hinds' feet, And sets me on my high places. -- 2 samuel 22:34
.
"He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. -- 2 samuel 22:35
.
"You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, And Your help makes me great. -- 2 samuel 22:36
.
"You enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped. -- 2 samuel 22:37
.
"I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, And I did not turn back until they were consumed. -- 2 samuel 22:38
.
"And I have devoured them and shattered them, so that they did not rise; And they fell under my feet. -- 2 samuel 22:39
.
"For You have girded me with strength for battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. -- 2 samuel 22:40
.
"You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me. -- 2 samuel 22:41
.
"They looked, but there was none to save; Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them. -- 2 samuel 22:42
.
"Then I pulverized them as the dust of the earth; I crushed and stamped them as the mire of the streets. -- 2 samuel 22:43
.
"You have also delivered me from the contentions of my people; You have kept me as head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me. -- 2 samuel 22:44
.
"Foreigners pretend obedience to me; As soon as they hear, they obey me. -- 2 samuel 22:45
.
"Foreigners lose heart, And come trembling out of their fortresses. -- 2 samuel 22:46
.
"The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation, -- 2 samuel 22:47
.
The God who executes vengeance for me, And brings down peoples under me, -- 2 samuel 22:48
.
Who also brings me out from my enemies; You even lift me above those who rise up against me; You rescue me from the violent man. -- 2 samuel 22:49
.
"Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the nations, And I will sing praises to Your name. -- 2 samuel 22:50
.
"He is a tower of deliverance to His king, And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever." -- 2 samuel 22:51
.
Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse declares, The man who was raised on high declares, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel, -- 2 samuel 23:1
.
"The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was on my tongue. -- 2 samuel 23:2
.
"The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, 'He who rules over men righteously, Who rules in the fear of God, -- 2 samuel 23:3
.
Is as the light of the morning when the sun rises, A morning without clouds, When the tender grass springs out of the earth, Through sunshine after rain.' -- 2 samuel 23:4
.
"Truly is not my house so with God? For He has made an everlasting covenant with me, Ordered in all things, and secured; For all my salvation and all my desire, Will He not indeed make it grow? -- 2 samuel 23:5
.
"But the worthless, every one of them will be thrust away like thorns, Because they cannot be taken in hand; -- 2 samuel 23:6
.
But the man who touches them Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, And they will be completely burned with fire in their place." -- 2 samuel 23:7
.
These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, he was called Adino the Eznite, because of eight hundred slain by him at one time; -- 2 samuel 23:8
.
and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle and the men of Israel had withdrawn. -- 2 samuel 23:9
.
He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword, and the LORD brought about a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to strip the slain. -- 2 samuel 23:10
.
Now after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered into a troop where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines. -- 2 samuel 23:11
.
But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, defended it and struck the Philistines; and the LORD brought about a great victory. -- 2 samuel 23:12
.
Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while the troop of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim. -- 2 samuel 23:13
.
David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. -- 2 samuel 23:14
.
David had a craving and said, "Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!" -- 2 samuel 23:15
.
So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD; -- 2 samuel 23:16
.
and he said, "Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did. -- 2 samuel 23:17
.
Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he swung his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name as well as the three. -- 2 samuel 23:18
.
He was most honored of the thirty, therefore he became their commander; however, he did not attain to the three. -- 2 samuel 23:19
.
Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. -- 2 samuel 23:20
.
He killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. Now the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. -- 2 samuel 23:21
.
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name as well as the three mighty men. -- 2 samuel 23:22
.
He was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David appointed him over his guard. -- 2 samuel 23:23
.
Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, -- 2 samuel 23:24
.
Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, -- 2 samuel 23:25
.
Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, -- 2 samuel 23:26
.
Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, -- 2 samuel 23:27
.
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, -- 2 samuel 23:28
.
Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, -- 2 samuel 23:29
.
Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, -- 2 samuel 23:30
.
Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, -- 2 samuel 23:31
.
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, -- 2 samuel 23:32
.
Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, -- 2 samuel 23:33
.
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, -- 2 samuel 23:34
.
Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, -- 2 samuel 23:35
.
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, -- 2 samuel 23:36
.
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers of Joab the son of Zeruiah, -- 2 samuel 23:37
.
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, -- 2 samuel 23:38
.
Uriah the Hittite; thirty-seven in all. -- 2 samuel 23:39
.
Now again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and it incited David against them to say, "Go, number Israel and Judah." -- 2 samuel 24:1
.
The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, "Go about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people, that I may know the number of the people." -- 2 samuel 24:2
.
But Joab said to the king, "Now may the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?" -- 2 samuel 24:3
.
Nevertheless, the king's word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to register the people of Israel. -- 2 samuel 24:4
.
They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad and toward Jazer. -- 2 samuel 24:5
.
Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon, -- 2 samuel 24:6
.
and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba. -- 2 samuel 24:7
.
So when they had gone about through the whole land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. -- 2 samuel 24:8
.
And Joab gave the number of the registration of the people to the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. -- 2 samuel 24:9
.
Now David's heart troubled him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly." -- 2 samuel 24:10
.
When David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, -- 2 samuel 24:11
.
"Go and speak to David, 'Thus the LORD says, "I am offering you three things; choose for yourself one of them, which I will do to you."'" -- 2 samuel 24:12
.
So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, "Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me." -- 2 samuel 24:13
.
Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress. Let us now fall into the hand of the LORD for His mercies are great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man." -- 2 samuel 24:14
.
So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. -- 2 samuel 24:15
.
When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who destroyed the people, "It is enough! Now relax your hand!" And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. -- 2 samuel 24:16
.
Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking down the people, and said, "Behold, it is I who have sinned, and it is I who have done wrong; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand be against me and against my father's house." -- 2 samuel 24:17
.
So Gad came to David that day and said to him, "Go up, erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite." -- 2 samuel 24:18
.
David went up according to the word of Gad, just as the LORD had commanded. -- 2 samuel 24:19
.
Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; and Araunah went out and bowed his face to the ground before the king. -- 2 samuel 24:20
.
Then Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" And David said, "To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be held back from the people." -- 2 samuel 24:21
.
Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his sight. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. -- 2 samuel 24:22
.
"Everything, O king, Araunah gives to the king." And Araunah said to the king, "May the LORD your God accept you." -- 2 samuel 24:23
.
However, the king said to Araunah, "No, but I will surely buy it from you for a price, for I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God which cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. -- 2 samuel 24:24
.
David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Thus the LORD was moved by prayer for the land, and the plague was held back from Israel. -- 2 samuel 24:25
.
Now King David was old, advanced in age; and they covered him with clothes, but he could not keep warm. -- 1 kings 1:1
.
So his servants said to him, "Let them seek a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her attend the king and become his nurse; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm." -- 1 kings 1:2
.
So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. -- 1 kings 1:3
.
The girl was very beautiful; and she became the king's nurse and served him, but the king did not cohabit with her. -- 1 kings 1:4
.
Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." So he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen with fifty men to run before him. -- 1 kings 1:5
.
His father had never crossed him at any time by asking, "Why have you done so?" And he was also a very handsome man, and he was born after Absalom. -- 1 kings 1:6
.
He had conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and following Adonijah they helped him. -- 1 kings 1:7
.
But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. -- 1 kings 1:8
.
Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants. -- 1 kings 1:9
.
But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, and Solomon his brother. -- 1 kings 1:10
.
Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, "Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it? -- 1 kings 1:11
.
"So now come, please let me give you counsel and save your life and the life of your son Solomon. -- 1 kings 1:12
.
"Go at once to King David and say to him, 'Have you not, my lord, O king, sworn to your maidservant, saying, "Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?' -- 1 kings 1:13
.
"Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words." -- 1 kings 1:14
.
So Bathsheba went in to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king. -- 1 kings 1:15
.
Then Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king. And the king said, "What do you wish?" -- 1 kings 1:16
.
She said to him, "My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God, saying, 'Surely your son Solomon shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne.' -- 1 kings 1:17
.
"Now, behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know it. -- 1 kings 1:18
.
"He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant. -- 1 kings 1:19
.
"As for you now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. -- 1 kings 1:20
.
"Otherwise it will come about, as soon as my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders." -- 1 kings 1:21
.
Behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. -- 1 kings 1:22
.
They told the king, saying, "Here is Nathan the prophet." And when he came in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. -- 1 kings 1:23
.
Then Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne'? -- 1 kings 1:24
.
"For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons and the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they say, 'Long live King Adonijah!' -- 1 kings 1:25
.
"But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon, he has not invited. -- 1 kings 1:26
.
"Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?" -- 1 kings 1:27
.
Then King David said, "Call Bathsheba to me." And she came into the king's presence and stood before the king. -- 1 kings 1:28
.
The king vowed and said, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, -- 1 kings 1:29
.
surely as I vowed to you by the LORD the God of Israel, saying, 'Your son Solomon shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place'; I will indeed do so this day." -- 1 kings 1:30
.
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and prostrated herself before the king and said, "May my lord King David live forever." -- 1 kings 1:31
.
Then King David said, "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." And they came into the king's presence. -- 1 kings 1:32
.
The king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. -- 1 kings 1:33
.
"Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel, and blow the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon!' -- 1 kings 1:34
.
"Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne and be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah." -- 1 kings 1:35
.
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, "Amen! Thus may the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say. -- 1 kings 1:36
.
"As the LORD has been with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!" -- 1 kings 1:37
.
So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. -- 1 kings 1:38
.
Zadok the priest then took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!" -- 1 kings 1:39
.
All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook at their noise. -- 1 kings 1:40
.
Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "Why is the city making such an uproar?" -- 1 kings 1:41
.
While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Then Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are a valiant man and bring good news." -- 1 kings 1:42
.
But Jonathan replied to Adonijah, "No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. -- 1 kings 1:43
.
"The king has also sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king's mule. -- 1 kings 1:44
.
"Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which you have heard. -- 1 kings 1:45
.
"Besides, Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom. -- 1 kings 1:46
.
"Moreover, the king's servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!' And the king bowed himself on the bed. -- 1 kings 1:47
.
"The king has also said thus, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted one to sit on my throne today while my own eyes see it.'" -- 1 kings 1:48
.
Then all the guests of Adonijah were terrified; and they arose and each went on his way. -- 1 kings 1:49
.
And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, and he arose, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. -- 1 kings 1:50
.
Now it was told Solomon, saying, "Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'" -- 1 kings 1:51
.
Solomon said, "If he is a worthy man, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die." -- 1 kings 1:52
.
So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house." -- 1 kings 1:53
.
As David's time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying, -- 1 kings 2:1
.
"I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, therefore, and show yourself a man. -- 1 kings 2:2
.
"Keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to what is written in the Law of Moses, that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn, -- 1 kings 2:3
.
so that the LORD may carry out His promise which He spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons are careful of their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.' -- 1 kings 2:4
.
"Now you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed; he also shed the blood of war in peace. And he put the blood of war on his belt about his waist, and on his sandals on his feet. -- 1 kings 2:5
.
"So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace. -- 1 kings 2:6
.
"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for they assisted me when I fled from Absalom your brother. -- 1 kings 2:7
.
"Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite, of Bahurim; now it was he who cursed me with a violent curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.' -- 1 kings 2:8
.
"Now therefore, do not let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you will bring his gray hair down to Sheol with blood." -- 1 kings 2:9
.
Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. -- 1 kings 2:10
.
The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years he reigned in Hebron and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem. -- 1 kings 2:11
.
And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established. -- 1 kings 2:12
.
Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, "Do you come peacefully?" And he said, "Peacefully." -- 1 kings 2:13
.
Then he said, "I have something to say to you." And she said, "Speak." -- 1 kings 2:14
.
So he said, "You know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel expected me to be king; however, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the LORD. -- 1 kings 2:15
.
"Now I am making one request of you; do not refuse me." And she said to him, "Speak." -- 1 kings 2:16
.
Then he said, "Please speak to Solomon the king, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife." -- 1 kings 2:17
.
Bathsheba said, "Very well; I will speak to the king for you." -- 1 kings 2:18
.
So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king arose to meet her, bowed before her, and sat on his throne; then he had a throne set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right. -- 1 kings 2:19
.
Then she said, "I am making one small request of you; do not refuse me." And the king said to her, "Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you." -- 1 kings 2:20
.
So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife." -- 1 kings 2:21
.
King Solomon answered and said to his mother, "And why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom--for he is my older brother--even for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah!" -- 1 kings 2:22
.
Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, "May God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life. -- 1 kings 2:23
.
"Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father and who has made me a house as He promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death today." -- 1 kings 2:24
.
So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him so that he died. -- 1 kings 2:25
.
Then to Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go to Anathoth to your own field, for you deserve to die; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and because you were afflicted in everything with which my father was afflicted." -- 1 kings 2:26
.
So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD, which He had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. -- 1 kings 2:27
.
Now the news came to Joab, for Joab had followed Adonijah, although he had not followed Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. -- 1 kings 2:28
.
It was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD, and behold, he is beside the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, fall upon him." -- 1 kings 2:29
.
So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, "Thus the king has said, 'Come out.'" But he said, "No, for I will die here." And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus spoke Joab, and thus he answered me." -- 1 kings 2:30
.
The king said to him, "Do as he has spoken and fall upon him and bury him, that you may remove from me and from my father's house the blood which Joab shed without cause. -- 1 kings 2:31
.
"The LORD will return his blood on his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and killed them with the sword, while my father David did not know it: Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. -- 1 kings 2:32
.
"So shall their blood return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever; but to David and his descendants and his house and his throne, may there be peace from the LORD forever." -- 1 kings 2:33
.
Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and put him to death, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness. -- 1 kings 2:34
.
The king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar. -- 1 kings 2:35
.
Now the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, "Build for yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there to any place. -- 1 kings 2:36
.
"For on the day you go out and cross over the brook Kidron, you will know for certain that you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head." -- 1 kings 2:37
.
Shimei then said to the king, "The word is good. As my lord the king has said, so your servant will do." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. -- 1 kings 2:38
.
But it came about at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, "Behold, your servants are in Gath." -- 1 kings 2:39
.
Then Shimei arose and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to look for his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath. -- 1 kings 2:40
.
It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned. -- 1 kings 2:41
.
So the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, 'You will know for certain that on the day you depart and go anywhere, you shall surely die'? And you said to me, 'The word which I have heard is good.' -- 1 kings 2:42
.
"Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the command which I have laid on you?" -- 1 kings 2:43
.
The king also said to Shimei, "You know all the evil which you acknowledge in your heart, which you did to my father David; therefore the LORD shall return your evil on your own head. -- 1 kings 2:44
.
"But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever." -- 1 kings 2:45
.
So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him so that he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hands of Solomon. -- 1 kings 2:46
.
Then Solomon formed a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her to the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem. -- 1 kings 3:1
.
The people were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the LORD until those days. -- 1 kings 3:2
.
Now Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David, except he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. -- 1 kings 3:3
.
The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. -- 1 kings 3:4
.
In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; and God said, "Ask what you wish me to give you." -- 1 kings 3:5
.
Then Solomon said, "You have shown great lovingkindness to Your servant David my father, according as he walked before You in truth and righteousness and uprightness of heart toward You; and You have reserved for him this great lovingkindness, that You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. -- 1 kings 3:6
.
"Now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. -- 1 kings 3:7
.
"Your servant is in the midst of Your people which You have chosen, a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted. -- 1 kings 3:8
.
"So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?" -- 1 kings 3:9
.
It was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. -- 1 kings 3:10
.
God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice, -- 1 kings 3:11
.
behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you. -- 1 kings 3:12
.
"I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days. -- 1 kings 3:13
.
"If you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days." -- 1 kings 3:14
.
Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants. -- 1 kings 3:15
.
Then two women who were harlots came to the king and stood before him. -- 1 kings 3:16
.
The one woman said, "Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. -- 1 kings 3:17
.
"It happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth to a child, and we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, only the two of us in the house. -- 1 kings 3:18
.
"This woman's son died in the night, because she lay on it. -- 1 kings 3:19
.
"So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom. -- 1 kings 3:20
.
"When I rose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead; but when I looked at him carefully in the morning, behold, he was not my son, whom I had borne." -- 1 kings 3:21
.
Then the other woman said, "No! For the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son." But the first woman said, "No! For the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son." Thus they spoke before the king. -- 1 kings 3:22
.
Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son who is living, and your son is the dead one'; and the other says, 'No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.'" -- 1 kings 3:23
.
The king said, "Get me a sword." So they brought a sword before the king. -- 1 kings 3:24
.
The king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other." -- 1 kings 3:25
.
Then the woman whose child was the living one spoke to the king, for she was deeply stirred over her son and said, "Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him." But the other said, "He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him!" -- 1 kings 3:26
.
Then the king said, "Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him. She is his mother." -- 1 kings 3:27
.
When all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had handed down, they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice. -- 1 kings 3:28
.
Now King Solomon was king over all Israel. -- 1 kings 4:1
.
These were his officials: Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest; -- 1 kings 4:2
.
Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha were secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; -- 1 kings 4:3
.
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; -- 1 kings 4:4
.
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the deputies; and Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest, was the king's friend; -- 1 kings 4:5
.
and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor. -- 1 kings 4:6
.
Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who provided for the king and his household; each man had to provide for a month in the year. -- 1 kings 4:7
.
These are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; -- 1 kings 4:8
.
Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan; -- 1 kings 4:9
.
Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh was his and all the land of Hepher); -- 1 kings 4:10
.
Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife); -- 1 kings 4:11
.
Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as the other side of Jokmeam; -- 1 kings 4:12
.
Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead were his: the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars were his); -- 1 kings 4:13
.
Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; -- 1 kings 4:14
.
Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also married Basemath the daughter of Solomon); -- 1 kings 4:15
.
Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; -- 1 kings 4:16
.
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; -- 1 kings 4:17
.
Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; -- 1 kings 4:18
.
Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only deputy who was in the land. -- 1 kings 4:19
.
Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing. -- 1 kings 4:20
.
Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. -- 1 kings 4:21
.
Solomon's provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour and sixty kors of meal, -- 1 kings 4:22
.
ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl. -- 1 kings 4:23
.
For he had dominion over everything west of the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace on all sides around about him. -- 1 kings 4:24
.
So Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. -- 1 kings 4:25
.
Solomon had 40,stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen. -- 1 kings 4:26
.
Those deputies provided for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon's table, each in his month; they left nothing lacking. -- 1 kings 4:27
.
They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it should be, each according to his charge. -- 1 kings 4:28
.
Now God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore. -- 1 kings 4:29
.
Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. -- 1 kings 4:30
.
For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was known in all the surrounding nations. -- 1 kings 4:31
.
He also spoke 3,proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. -- 1 kings 4:32
.
He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of animals and birds and creeping things and fish. -- 1 kings 4:33
.
Men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom. -- 1 kings 4:34
.
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend of David. -- 1 kings 5:1
.
Then Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying, -- 1 kings 5:2
.
"You know that David my father was unable to build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. -- 1 kings 5:3
.
"But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune. -- 1 kings 5:4
.
"Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, 'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he will build the house for My name.' -- 1 kings 5:5
.
"Now therefore, command that they cut for me cedars from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians." -- 1 kings 5:6
.
When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, "Blessed be the LORD today, who has given to David a wise son over this great people." -- 1 kings 5:7
.
So Hiram sent word to Solomon, saying, "I have heard the message which you have sent me; I will do what you desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber. -- 1 kings 5:8
.
"My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place where you direct me, and I will have them broken up there, and you shall carry them away. Then you shall accomplish my desire by giving food to my household." -- 1 kings 5:9
.
So Hiram gave Solomon as much as he desired of the cedar and cypress timber. -- 1 kings 5:10
.
Solomon then gave Hiram 20,kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of beaten oil; thus Solomon would give Hiram year by year. -- 1 kings 5:11
.
The LORD gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant. -- 1 kings 5:12
.
Now King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,men. -- 1 kings 5:13
.
He sent them to Lebanon, 10,a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the forced laborers. -- 1 kings 5:14
.
Now Solomon had 70,transporters, and 80,000 hewers of stone in the mountains, -- 1 kings 5:15
.
besides Solomon's 3,chief deputies who were over the project and who ruled over the people who were doing the work. -- 1 kings 5:16
.
Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones. -- 1 kings 5:17
.
So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house. -- 1 kings 5:18
.
Now it came about in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. -- 1 kings 6:1
.
As for the house which King Solomon built for the LORD, its length was sixty cubits and its width twenty cubits and its height thirty cubits. -- 1 kings 6:2
.
The porch in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits in length, corresponding to the width of the house, and its depth along the front of the house was ten cubits. -- 1 kings 6:3
.
Also for the house he made windows with artistic frames. -- 1 kings 6:4
.
Against the wall of the house he built stories encompassing the walls of the house around both the nave and the inner sanctuary; thus he made side chambers all around. -- 1 kings 6:5
.
The lowest story was five cubits wide, and the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around in order that the beams would not be inserted in the walls of the house. -- 1 kings 6:6
.
The house, while it was being built, was built of stone prepared at the quarry, and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any iron tool heard in the house while it was being built. -- 1 kings 6:7
.
The doorway for the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the house; and they would go up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle to the third. -- 1 kings 6:8
.
So he built the house and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar. -- 1 kings 6:9
.
He also built the stories against the whole house, each five cubits high; and they were fastened to the house with timbers of cedar. -- 1 kings 6:10
.
Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon saying, -- 1 kings 6:11
.
"Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in My statutes and execute My ordinances and keep all My commandments by walking in them, then I will carry out My word with you which I spoke to David your father. -- 1 kings 6:12
.
"I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel." -- 1 kings 6:13
.
So Solomon built the house and finished it. -- 1 kings 6:14
.
Then he built the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the ceiling he overlaid the walls on the inside with wood, and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress. -- 1 kings 6:15
.
He built twenty cubits on the rear part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling; he built them for it on the inside as an inner sanctuary, even as the most holy place. -- 1 kings 6:16
.
The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long. -- 1 kings 6:17
.
There was cedar on the house within, carved in the shape of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, there was no stone seen. -- 1 kings 6:18
.
Then he prepared an inner sanctuary within the house in order to place there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. -- 1 kings 6:19
.
The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in height, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar. -- 1 kings 6:20
.
So Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across the front of the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold. -- 1 kings 6:21
.
He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar which was by the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold. -- 1 kings 6:22
.
Also in the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high. -- 1 kings 6:23
.
Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing were ten cubits. -- 1 kings 6:24
.
The other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of the same measure and the same form. -- 1 kings 6:25
.
The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub. -- 1 kings 6:26
.
He placed the cherubim in the midst of the inner house, and the wings of the cherubim were spread out, so that the wing of the one was touching the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall. So their wings were touching each other in the center of the house. -- 1 kings 6:27
.
He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. -- 1 kings 6:28
.
Then he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, inner and outer sanctuaries. -- 1 kings 6:29
.
He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inner and outer sanctuaries. -- 1 kings 6:30
.
For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood, the lintel and five-sided doorposts. -- 1 kings 6:31
.
So he made two doors of olive wood, and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees. -- 1 kings 6:32
.
So also he made for the entrance of the nave four-sided doorposts of olive wood -- 1 kings 6:33
.
and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door turned on pivots, and the two leaves of the other door turned on pivots. -- 1 kings 6:34
.
He carved on it cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the engraved work. -- 1 kings 6:35
.
He built the inner court with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams. -- 1 kings 6:36
.
In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv. -- 1 kings 6:37
.
In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts and according to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it. -- 1 kings 6:38
.
Now Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. -- 1 kings 7:1
.
He built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was cubits and its width 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars. -- 1 kings 7:2
.
It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the pillars, 15 in each row. -- 1 kings 7:3
.
There were artistic window frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks. -- 1 kings 7:4
.
All the doorways and doorposts had squared artistic frames, and window was opposite window in three ranks. -- 1 kings 7:5
.
Then he made the hall of pillars; its length was cubits and its width 30 cubits, and a porch was in front of them and pillars and a threshold in front of them. -- 1 kings 7:6
.
He made the hall of the throne where he was to judge, the hall of judgment, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor. -- 1 kings 7:7
.
His house where he was to live, the other court inward from the hall, was of the same workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had married. -- 1 kings 7:8
.
All these were of costly stones, of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside; even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court. -- 1 kings 7:9
.
The foundation was of costly stones, even large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits. -- 1 kings 7:10
.
And above were costly stones, stone cut according to measure, and cedar. -- 1 kings 7:11
.
So the great court all around had three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams even as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the porch of the house. -- 1 kings 7:12
.
Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre. -- 1 kings 7:13
.
He was a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill for doing any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work. -- 1 kings 7:14
.
He fashioned the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both. -- 1 kings 7:15
.
He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits. -- 1 kings 7:16
.
There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. -- 1 kings 7:17
.
So he made the pillars, and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and so he did for the other capital. -- 1 kings 7:18
.
The capitals which were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily design, four cubits. -- 1 kings 7:19
.
There were capitals on the two pillars, even above and close to the rounded projection which was beside the network; and the pomegranates numbered two hundred in rows around both capitals. -- 1 kings 7:20
.
Thus he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave; and he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz. -- 1 kings 7:21
.
On the top of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished. -- 1 kings 7:22
.
Now he made the sea of cast metal ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits, and thirty cubits in circumference. -- 1 kings 7:23
.
Under its brim gourds went around encircling it ten to a cubit, completely surrounding the sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast with the rest. -- 1 kings 7:24
.
It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea was set on top of them, and all their rear parts turned inward. -- 1 kings 7:25
.
It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, as a lily blossom; it could hold two thousand baths. -- 1 kings 7:26
.
Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits. -- 1 kings 7:27
.
This was the design of the stands: they had borders, even borders between the frames, -- 1 kings 7:28
.
and on the borders which were between the frames were lions, oxen and cherubim; and on the frames there was a pedestal above, and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. -- 1 kings 7:29
.
Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the basin were cast supports with wreaths at each side. -- 1 kings 7:30
.
Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit, and its opening was round like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its opening there were engravings, and their borders were square, not round. -- 1 kings 7:31
.
The four wheels were underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels were on the stand. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half. -- 1 kings 7:32
.
The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast. -- 1 kings 7:33
.
Now there were four supports at the four corners of each stand; its supports were part of the stand itself. -- 1 kings 7:34
.
On the top of the stand there was a circular form half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders were part of it. -- 1 kings 7:35
.
He engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders, cherubim, lions and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths all around. -- 1 kings 7:36
.
He made the ten stands like this: all of them had one casting, one measure and one form. -- 1 kings 7:37
.
He made ten basins of bronze, one basin held forty baths; each basin was four cubits, and on each of the ten stands was one basin. -- 1 kings 7:38
.
Then he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea of cast metal on the right side of the house eastward toward the south. -- 1 kings 7:39
.
Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of the LORD: -- 1 kings 7:40
.
the two pillars and the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; -- 1 kings 7:41
.
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the tops of the pillars; -- 1 kings 7:42
.
and the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands; -- 1 kings 7:43
.
and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea; -- 1 kings 7:44
.
and the pails and the shovels and the bowls; even all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon in the house of the LORD were of polished bronze. -- 1 kings 7:45
.
In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. -- 1 kings 7:46
.
Solomon left all the utensils unweighed, because they were too many; the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained. -- 1 kings 7:47
.
Solomon made all the furniture which was in the house of the LORD: the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence; -- 1 kings 7:48
.
and the lampstands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs, of gold; -- 1 kings 7:49
.
and the cups and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the nave, of gold. -- 1 kings 7:50
.
Thus all the work that King Solomon performed in the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things dedicated by his father David, the silver and the gold and the utensils, and he put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD. -- 1 kings 7:51
.
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' households of the sons of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion. -- 1 kings 8:1
.
All the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. -- 1 kings 8:2
.
Then all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. -- 1 kings 8:3
.
They brought up the ark of the LORD and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils, which were in the tent, and the priests and the Levites brought them up. -- 1 kings 8:4
.
And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they could not be counted or numbered. -- 1 kings 8:5
.
Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim. -- 1 kings 8:6
.
For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles from above. -- 1 kings 8:7
.
But the poles were so long that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; they are there to this day. -- 1 kings 8:8
.
There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. -- 1 kings 8:9
.
It happened that when the priests came from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of the LORD, -- 1 kings 8:10
.
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. -- 1 kings 8:11
.
Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud. -- 1 kings 8:12
.
"I have surely built You a lofty house, A place for Your dwelling forever." -- 1 kings 8:13
.
Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing. -- 1 kings 8:14
.
He said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hand, saying, -- 1 kings 8:15
.
'Since the day that I brought My people Israel from Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there, but I chose David to be over My people Israel.' -- 1 kings 8:16
.
"Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. -- 1 kings 8:17
.
"But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart. -- 1 kings 8:18
.
'Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he will build the house for My name.' -- 1 kings 8:19
.
"Now the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; for I have risen in place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. -- 1 kings 8:20
.
"There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with our fathers when He brought them from the land of Egypt." -- 1 kings 8:21
.
Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven. -- 1 kings 8:22
.
He said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing lovingkindness to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart, -- 1 kings 8:23
.
who have kept with Your servant, my father David, that which You have promised him; indeed, You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand as it is this day. -- 1 kings 8:24
.
"Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Your servant David my father that which You have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way to walk before Me as you have walked.' -- 1 kings 8:25
.
"Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Your word, I pray, be confirmed which You have spoken to Your servant, my father David. -- 1 kings 8:26
.
"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built! -- 1 kings 8:27
.
"Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant prays before You today; -- 1 kings 8:28
.
that Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which You have said, 'My name shall be there,' to listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place. -- 1 kings 8:29
.
"Listen to the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place; hear in heaven Your dwelling place; hear and forgive. -- 1 kings 8:30
.
"If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this house, -- 1 kings 8:31
.
then hear in heaven and act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness. -- 1 kings 8:32
.
"When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, if they turn to You again and confess Your name and pray and make supplication to You in this house, -- 1 kings 8:33
.
then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers. -- 1 kings 8:34
.
"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from their sin when You afflict them, -- 1 kings 8:35
.
then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your land, which You have given Your people for an inheritance. -- 1 kings 8:36
.
"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper, if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is, -- 1 kings 8:37
.
whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all Your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading his hands toward this house; -- 1 kings 8:38
.
then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive and act and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know, for You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men, -- 1 kings 8:39
.
that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You have given to our fathers. -- 1 kings 8:40
.
"Also concerning the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for Your name's sake -- 1 kings 8:41
.
(for they will hear of Your great name and Your mighty hand, and of Your outstretched arm); when he comes and prays toward this house, -- 1 kings 8:42
.
hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, to fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name. -- 1 kings 8:43
.
"When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name, -- 1 kings 8:44
.
then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. -- 1 kings 8:45
.
"When they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near; -- 1 kings 8:46
.
if they take thought in the land where they have been taken captive, and repent and make supplication to You in the land of those who have taken them captive, saying, 'We have sinned and have committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly'; -- 1 kings 8:47
.
if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and pray to You toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your name; -- 1 kings 8:48
.
then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven Your dwelling place, and maintain their cause, -- 1 kings 8:49
.
and forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You, and make them objects of compassion before those who have taken them captive, that they may have compassion on them -- 1 kings 8:50
.
(for they are Your people and Your inheritance which You have brought forth from Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace), -- 1 kings 8:51
.
that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and to the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to You. -- 1 kings 8:52
.
"For You have separated them from all the peoples of the earth as Your inheritance, as You spoke through Moses Your servant, when You brought our fathers forth from Egypt, O Lord GOD." -- 1 kings 8:53
.
When Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread toward heaven. -- 1 kings 8:54
.
And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying: -- 1 kings 8:55
.
"Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised; not one word has failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant. -- 1 kings 8:56
.
"May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He not leave us or forsake us, -- 1 kings 8:57
.
that He may incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers. -- 1 kings 8:58
.
"And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, as each day requires, -- 1 kings 8:59
.
so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no one else. -- 1 kings 8:60
.
"Let your heart therefore be wholly devoted to the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments, as at this day." -- 1 kings 8:61
.
Now the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the LORD. -- 1 kings 8:62
.
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, 22,oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. -- 1 kings 8:63
.
On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, because there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings; for the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings. -- 1 kings 8:64
.
So Solomon observed the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, for seven days and seven more days, even fourteen days. -- 1 kings 8:65
.
On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king. Then they went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David His servant and to Israel His people. -- 1 kings 8:66
.
Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all that Solomon desired to do, -- 1 kings 9:1
.
that the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. -- 1 kings 9:2
.
The LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your supplication, which you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built by putting My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. -- 1 kings 9:3
.
"As for you, if you will walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you and will keep My statutes and My ordinances, -- 1 kings 9:4
.
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised to your father David, saying, 'You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.' -- 1 kings 9:5
.
"But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, -- 1 kings 9:6
.
then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. -- 1 kings 9:7
.
"And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss and say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?' -- 1 kings 9:8
.
"And they will say, 'Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them, therefore the LORD has brought all this adversity on them.'" -- 1 kings 9:9
.
It came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house -- 1 kings 9:10
.
(Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold according to all his desire), then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. -- 1 kings 9:11
.
So Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him. -- 1 kings 9:12
.
He said, "What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?" So they were called the land of Cabul to this day. -- 1 kings 9:13
.
And Hiram sent to the king talents of gold. -- 1 kings 9:14
.
Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. -- 1 kings 9:15
.
For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife. -- 1 kings 9:16
.
So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon -- 1 kings 9:17
.
and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah, -- 1 kings 9:18
.
and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule. -- 1 kings 9:19
.
As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel, -- 1 kings 9:20
.
their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel were unable to destroy utterly, from them Solomon levied forced laborers, even to this day. -- 1 kings 9:21
.
But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen. -- 1 kings 9:22
.
These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people doing the work. -- 1 kings 9:23
.
As soon as Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her, then he built the Millo. -- 1 kings 9:24
.
Now three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, burning incense with them on the altar which was before the LORD. So he finished the house. -- 1 kings 9:25
.
King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. -- 1 kings 9:26
.
And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon. -- 1 kings 9:27
.
They went to Ophir and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon. -- 1 kings 9:28
.
Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions. -- 1 kings 10:1
.
So she came to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart. -- 1 kings 10:2
.
Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from the king which he did not explain to her. -- 1 kings 10:3
.
When the queen of Sheba perceived all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, -- 1 kings 10:4
.
the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her. -- 1 kings 10:5
.
Then she said to the king, "It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. -- 1 kings 10:6
.
"Nevertheless I did not believe the reports, until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. You exceed in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard. -- 1 kings 10:7
.
"How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom. -- 1 kings 10:8
.
"Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel; because the LORD loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness." -- 1 kings 10:9
.
She gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great amount of spices and precious stones. Never again did such abundance of spices come in as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon. -- 1 kings 10:10
.
Also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a very great number of almug trees and precious stones. -- 1 kings 10:11
.
The king made of the almug trees supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, also lyres and harps for the singers; such almug trees have not come in again nor have they been seen to this day. -- 1 kings 10:12
.
King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested, besides what he gave her according to his royal bounty. Then she turned and went to her own land together with her servants. -- 1 kings 10:13
.
Now the weight of gold which came in to Solomon in one year was talents of gold, -- 1 kings 10:14
.
besides that from the traders and the wares of the merchants and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the country. -- 1 kings 10:15
.
King Solomon made large shields of beaten gold, using 600 shekels of gold on each large shield. -- 1 kings 10:16
.
He made shields of beaten gold, using three minas of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. -- 1 kings 10:17
.
Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with refined gold. -- 1 kings 10:18
.
There were six steps to the throne and a round top to the throne at its rear, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. -- 1 kings 10:19
.
Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom. -- 1 kings 10:20
.
All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None was of silver; it was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. -- 1 kings 10:21
.
For the king had at sea the ships of Tarshish with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks. -- 1 kings 10:22
.
So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. -- 1 kings 10:23
.
All the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. -- 1 kings 10:24
.
They brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year. -- 1 kings 10:25
.
Now Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had 1,chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. -- 1 kings 10:26
.
The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland. -- 1 kings 10:27
.
Also Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's merchants procured them from Kue for a price. -- 1 kings 10:28
.
A chariot was imported from Egypt for shekels of silver, and a horse for 150; and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of the Arameans. -- 1 kings 10:29
.
Now King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, -- 1 kings 11:1
.
from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the sons of Israel, "You shall not associate with them, nor shall they associate with you, for they will surely turn your heart away after their gods." Solomon held fast to these in love. -- 1 kings 11:2
.
He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart away. -- 1 kings 11:3
.
For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been. -- 1 kings 11:4
.
For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites. -- 1 kings 11:5
.
Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as David his father had done. -- 1 kings 11:6
.
Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon. -- 1 kings 11:7
.
Thus also he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods. -- 1 kings 11:8
.
Now the LORD was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, -- 1 kings 11:9
.
and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not observe what the LORD had commanded. -- 1 kings 11:10
.
So the LORD said to Solomon, "Because you have done this, and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant. -- 1 kings 11:11
.
"Nevertheless I will not do it in your days for the sake of your father David, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. -- 1 kings 11:12
.
"However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen." -- 1 kings 11:13
.
Then the LORD raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the royal line in Edom. -- 1 kings 11:14
.
For it came about, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck down every male in Edom -- 1 kings 11:15
.
(for Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom), -- 1 kings 11:16
.
that Hadad fled to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, while Hadad was a young boy. -- 1 kings 11:17
.
They arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him food and gave him land. -- 1 kings 11:18
.
Now Hadad found great favor before Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. -- 1 kings 11:19
.
The sister of Tahpenes bore his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh. -- 1 kings 11:20
.
But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Send me away, that I may go to my own country." -- 1 kings 11:21
.
Then Pharaoh said to him, "But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you are seeking to go to your own country?" And he answered, "Nothing; nevertheless you must surely let me go." -- 1 kings 11:22
.
God also raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah. -- 1 kings 11:23
.
He gathered men to himself and became leader of a marauding band, after David slew them of Zobah; and they went to Damascus and stayed there, and reigned in Damascus. -- 1 kings 11:24
.
So he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the evil that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Aram. -- 1 kings 11:25
.
Then Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king. -- 1 kings 11:26
.
Now this was the reason why he rebelled against the king: Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of his father David. -- 1 kings 11:27
.
Now the man Jeroboam was a valiant warrior, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. -- 1 kings 11:28
.
It came about at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had clothed himself with a new cloak; and both of them were alone in the field. -- 1 kings 11:29
.
Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him and tore it into twelve pieces. -- 1 kings 11:30
.
He said to Jeroboam, "Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and give you ten tribes -- 1 kings 11:31
.
(but he will have one tribe, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel), -- 1 kings 11:32
.
because they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and observing My statutes and My ordinances, as his father David did. -- 1 kings 11:33
.
'Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, who observed My commandments and My statutes; -- 1 kings 11:34
.
but I will take the kingdom from his son's hand and give it to you, even ten tribes. -- 1 kings 11:35
.
'But to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen for Myself to put My name. -- 1 kings 11:36
.
'I will take you, and you shall reign over whatever you desire, and you shall be king over Israel. -- 1 kings 11:37
.
'Then it will be, that if you listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight by observing My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build you an enduring house as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. -- 1 kings 11:38
.
'Thus I will afflict the descendants of David for this, but not always.'" -- 1 kings 11:39
.
Solomon sought therefore to put Jeroboam to death; but Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. -- 1 kings 11:40
.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and whatever he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? -- 1 kings 11:41
.
Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. -- 1 kings 11:42
.
And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David, and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place. -- 1 kings 11:43
.
Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. -- 1 kings 12:1
.
Now when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, he was living in Egypt (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon). -- 1 kings 12:2
.
Then they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, -- 1 kings 12:3
.
"Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you." -- 1 kings 12:4
.
Then he said to them, "Depart for three days, then return to me." So the people departed. -- 1 kings 12:5
.
King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, "How do you counsel me to answer this people?" -- 1 kings 12:6
.
Then they spoke to him, saying, "If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever." -- 1 kings 12:7
.
But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him. -- 1 kings 12:8
.
So he said to them, "What counsel do you give that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, 'Lighten the yoke which your father put on us'?" -- 1 kings 12:9
.
The young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us!' But you shall speak to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins! -- 1 kings 12:10
.
'Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'" -- 1 kings 12:11
.
Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, "Return to me on the third day." -- 1 kings 12:12
.
The king answered the people harshly, for he forsook the advice of the elders which they had given him, -- 1 kings 12:13
.
and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions." -- 1 kings 12:14
.
So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a turn of events from the LORD, that He might establish His word, which the LORD spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. -- 1 kings 12:15
.
When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; To your tents, O Israel! Now look after your own house, David!" So Israel departed to their tents. -- 1 kings 12:16
.
But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. -- 1 kings 12:17
.
Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. -- 1 kings 12:18
.
So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. -- 1 kings 12:19
.
It came about when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None but the tribe of Judah followed the house of David. -- 1 kings 12:20
.
Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. -- 1 kings 12:21
.
But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, -- 1 kings 12:22
.
"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people, saying, -- 1 kings 12:23
.
'Thus says the LORD, "You must not go up and fight against your relatives the sons of Israel; return every man to his house, for this thing has come from Me."'" So they listened to the word of the LORD, and returned and went their way according to the word of the LORD. -- 1 kings 12:24
.
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel. -- 1 kings 12:25
.
Jeroboam said in his heart, "Now the kingdom will return to the house of David. -- 1 kings 12:26
.
"If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will return to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah." -- 1 kings 12:27
.
So the king consulted, and made two golden calves, and he said to them, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold your gods, O Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt." -- 1 kings 12:28
.
He set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. -- 1 kings 12:29
.
Now this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan. -- 1 kings 12:30
.
And he made houses on high places, and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi. -- 1 kings 12:31
.
Jeroboam instituted a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast which is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; thus he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves which he had made. And he stationed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. -- 1 kings 12:32
.
Then he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised in his own heart; and he instituted a feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense. -- 1 kings 12:33
.
Now behold, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense. -- 1 kings 13:1
.
He cried against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, "O altar, altar, thus says the LORD, 'Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.'" -- 1 kings 13:2
.
Then he gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign which the LORD has spoken, 'Behold, the altar shall be split apart and the ashes which are on it shall be poured out.'" -- 1 kings 13:3
.
Now when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, "Seize him." But his hand which he stretched out against him dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself. -- 1 kings 13:4
.
The altar also was split apart and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. -- 1 kings 13:5
.
The king said to the man of God, "Please entreat the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me." So the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before. -- 1 kings 13:6
.
Then the king said to the man of God, "Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward." -- 1 kings 13:7
.
But the man of God said to the king, "If you were to give me half your house I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place. -- 1 kings 13:8
.
"For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way which you came.'" -- 1 kings 13:9
.
So he went another way and did not return by the way which he came to Bethel. -- 1 kings 13:10
.
Now an old prophet was living in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the deeds which the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words which he had spoken to the king, these also they related to their father. -- 1 kings 13:11
.
Their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" Now his sons had seen the way which the man of God who came from Judah had gone. -- 1 kings 13:12
.
Then he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode away on it. -- 1 kings 13:13
.
So he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" And he said, "I am." -- 1 kings 13:14
.
Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat bread." -- 1 kings 13:15
.
He said, "I cannot return with you, nor go with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. -- 1 kings 13:16
.
"For a command came to me by the word of the LORD, 'You shall eat no bread, nor drink water there; do not return by going the way which you came.'" -- 1 kings 13:17
.
He said to him, "I also am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.'" But he lied to him. -- 1 kings 13:18
.
So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house and drank water. -- 1 kings 13:19
.
Now it came about, as they were sitting down at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back; -- 1 kings 13:20
.
and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have disobeyed the command of the LORD, and have not observed the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you, -- 1 kings 13:21
.
but have returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to you, "Eat no bread and drink no water"; your body shall not come to the grave of your fathers.'" -- 1 kings 13:22
.
It came about after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet whom he had brought back. -- 1 kings 13:23
.
Now when he had gone, a lion met him on the way and killed him, and his body was thrown on the road, with the donkey standing beside it; the lion also was standing beside the body. -- 1 kings 13:24
.
And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown on the road, and the lion standing beside the body; so they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived. -- 1 kings 13:25
.
Now when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard it, he said, "It is the man of God, who disobeyed the command of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him." -- 1 kings 13:26
.
Then he spoke to his sons, saying, "Saddle the donkey for me." And they saddled it. -- 1 kings 13:27
.
He went and found his body thrown on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body; the lion had not eaten the body nor torn the donkey. -- 1 kings 13:28
.
So the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back, and he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him. -- 1 kings 13:29
.
He laid his body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, saying, "Alas, my brother!" -- 1 kings 13:30
.
After he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, "When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. -- 1 kings 13:31
.
"For the thing shall surely come to pass which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria." -- 1 kings 13:32
.
After this event Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again he made priests of the high places from among all the people; any who would, he ordained, to be priests of the high places. -- 1 kings 13:33
.
This event became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to blot it out and destroy it from off the face of the earth. -- 1 kings 13:34
.
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick. -- 1 kings 14:1
.
Jeroboam said to his wife, "Arise now, and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who spoke concerning me that I would be king over this people. -- 1 kings 14:2
.
"Take ten loaves with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy." -- 1 kings 14:3
.
Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. -- 1 kings 14:4
.
Now the LORD had said to Ahijah, "Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. You shall say thus and thus to her, for it will be when she arrives that she will pretend to be another woman." -- 1 kings 14:5
.
When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam, why do you pretend to be another woman? For I am sent to you with a harsh message. -- 1 kings 14:6
.
"Go, say to Jeroboam, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, "Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over My people Israel, -- 1 kings 14:7
.
and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you--yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only that which was right in My sight; -- 1 kings 14:8
.
you also have done more evil than all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back-- -- 1 kings 14:9
.
therefore behold, I am bringing calamity on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male person, both bond and free in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam, as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone. -- 1 kings 14:10
.
"Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs will eat. And he who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat; for the LORD has spoken it."' -- 1 kings 14:11
.
"Now you, arise, go to your house. When your feet enter the city the child will die. -- 1 kings 14:12
.
"All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam's family will come to the grave, because in him something good was found toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. -- 1 kings 14:13
.
"Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam this day and from now on. -- 1 kings 14:14
.
"For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking the LORD to anger. -- 1 kings 14:15
.
"He will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam, which he committed and with which he made Israel to sin." -- 1 kings 14:16
.
Then Jeroboam's wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. As she was entering the threshold of the house, the child died. -- 1 kings 14:17
.
All Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet. -- 1 kings 14:18
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. -- 1 kings 14:19
.
The time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place. -- 1 kings 14:20
.
Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. -- 1 kings 14:21
.
Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy more than all that their fathers had done, with the sins which they committed. -- 1 kings 14:22
.
For they also built for themselves high places and sacred pillars and Asherim on every high hill and beneath every luxuriant tree. -- 1 kings 14:23
.
There were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel. -- 1 kings 14:24
.
Now it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. -- 1 kings 14:25
.
He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house, and he took everything, even taking all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. -- 1 kings 14:26
.
So King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the doorway of the king's house. -- 1 kings 14:27
.
Then it happened as often as the king entered the house of the LORD, that the guards would carry them and would bring them back into the guards' room. -- 1 kings 14:28
.
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 1 kings 14:29
.
There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. -- 1 kings 14:30
.
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son became king in his place. -- 1 kings 14:31
.
Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. -- 1 kings 15:1
.
He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. -- 1 kings 15:2
.
He walked in all the sins of his father which he had committed before him; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, like the heart of his father David. -- 1 kings 15:3
.
But for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem; -- 1 kings 15:4
.
because David did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite. -- 1 kings 15:5
.
There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. -- 1 kings 15:6
.
Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. -- 1 kings 15:7
.
And Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son became king in his place. -- 1 kings 15:8
.
So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa began to reign as king of Judah. -- 1 kings 15:9
.
He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. -- 1 kings 15:10
.
Asa did what was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father. -- 1 kings 15:11
.
He also put away the male cult prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols which his fathers had made. -- 1 kings 15:12
.
He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother, because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah; and Asa cut down her horrid image and burned it at the brook Kidron. -- 1 kings 15:13
.
But the high places were not taken away; nevertheless the heart of Asa was wholly devoted to the LORD all his days. -- 1 kings 15:14
.
He brought into the house of the LORD the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things: silver and gold and utensils. -- 1 kings 15:15
.
Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. -- 1 kings 15:16
.
Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah. -- 1 kings 15:17
.
Then Asa took all the silver and the gold which were left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying, -- 1 kings 15:18
.
"Let there be a treaty between you and me, as between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you a present of silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me." -- 1 kings 15:19
.
So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah and all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali. -- 1 kings 15:20
.
When Baasha heard of it, he ceased fortifying Ramah and remained in Tirzah. -- 1 kings 15:21
.
Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah--none was exempt--and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built. And King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah. -- 1 kings 15:22
.
Now the rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. -- 1 kings 15:23
.
And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place. -- 1 kings 15:24
.
Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. -- 1 kings 15:25
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father and in his sin which he made Israel sin. -- 1 kings 15:26
.
Then Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. -- 1 kings 15:27
.
So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place. -- 1 kings 15:28
.
It came about as soon as he was king, he struck down all the household of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam any persons alive, until he had destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite, -- 1 kings 15:29
.
and because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. -- 1 kings 15:30
.
Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 1 kings 15:31
.
There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. -- 1 kings 15:32
.
In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years. -- 1 kings 15:33
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel sin. -- 1 kings 15:34
.
Now the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, -- 1 kings 16:1
.
"Inasmuch as I exalted you from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins, -- 1 kings 16:2
.
behold, I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. -- 1 kings 16:3
.
"Anyone of Baasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat." -- 1 kings 16:4
.
Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 1 kings 16:5
.
And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son became king in his place. -- 1 kings 16:6
.
Moreover, the word of the LORD through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani also came against Baasha and his household, both because of all the evil which he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck it. -- 1 kings 16:7
.
In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel at Tirzah, and reigned two years. -- 1 kings 16:8
.
His servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was at Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household at Tirzah. -- 1 kings 16:9
.
Then Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and became king in his place. -- 1 kings 16:10
.
It came about when he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave a single male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends. -- 1 kings 16:11
.
Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet, -- 1 kings 16:12
.
for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols. -- 1 kings 16:13
.
Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 1 kings 16:14
.
In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days at Tirzah. Now the people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. -- 1 kings 16:15
.
The people who were camped heard it said, "Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king." Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. -- 1 kings 16:16
.
Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah. -- 1 kings 16:17
.
When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house and burned the king's house over him with fire, and died, -- 1 kings 16:18
.
because of his sins which he sinned, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, making Israel sin. -- 1 kings 16:19
.
Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he carried out, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 1 kings 16:20
.
Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; the other half followed Omri. -- 1 kings 16:21
.
But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. And Tibni died and Omri became king. -- 1 kings 16:22
.
In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel and reigned twelve years; he reigned six years at Tirzah. -- 1 kings 16:23
.
He bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and named the city which he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill. -- 1 kings 16:24
.
Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, and acted more wickedly than all who were before him. -- 1 kings 16:25
.
For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sins which he made Israel sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel with their idols. -- 1 kings 16:26
.
Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might which he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 1 kings 16:27
.
So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son became king in his place. -- 1 kings 16:28
.
Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. -- 1 kings 16:29
.
Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all who were before him. -- 1 kings 16:30
.
It came about, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went to serve Baal and worshiped him. -- 1 kings 16:31
.
So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he built in Samaria. -- 1 kings 16:32
.
Ahab also made the Asherah. Thus Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel than all the kings of Israel who were before him. -- 1 kings 16:33
.
In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho; he laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun. -- 1 kings 16:34
.
Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the LORD, the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, surely there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word." -- 1 kings 17:1
.
The word of the LORD came to him, saying, -- 1 kings 17:2
.
"Go away from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. -- 1 kings 17:3
.
"It shall be that you will drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there." -- 1 kings 17:4
.
So he went and did according to the word of the LORD, for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. -- 1 kings 17:5
.
The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook. -- 1 kings 17:6
.
It happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land. -- 1 kings 17:7
.
Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, -- 1 kings 17:8
.
"Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you." -- 1 kings 17:9
.
So he arose and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, "Please get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink." -- 1 kings 17:10
.
As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, "Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand." -- 1 kings 17:11
.
But she said, "As the LORD your God lives, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar; and behold, I am gathering a few sticks that I may go in and prepare for me and my son, that we may eat it and die." -- 1 kings 17:12
.
Then Elijah said to her, "Do not fear; go, do as you have said, but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out to me, and afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son. -- 1 kings 17:13
.
"For thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'The bowl of flour shall not be exhausted, nor shall the jar of oil be empty, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the face of the earth.'" -- 1 kings 17:14
.
So she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and she and he and her household ate for many days. -- 1 kings 17:15
.
The bowl of flour was not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through Elijah. -- 1 kings 17:16
.
Now it came about after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. -- 1 kings 17:17
.
So she said to Elijah, "What do I have to do with you, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and to put my son to death!" -- 1 kings 17:18
.
He said to her, "Give me your son." Then he took him from her bosom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living, and laid him on his own bed. -- 1 kings 17:19
.
He called to the LORD and said, "O LORD my God, have You also brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?" -- 1 kings 17:20
.
Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and called to the LORD and said, "O LORD my God, I pray You, let this child's life return to him." -- 1 kings 17:21
.
The LORD heard the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned to him and he revived. -- 1 kings 17:22
.
Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, "See, your son is alive." -- 1 kings 17:23
.
Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth." -- 1 kings 17:24
.
Now it happened after many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth." -- 1 kings 18:1
.
So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. -- 1 kings 18:2
.
Ahab called Obadiah who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly; -- 1 kings 18:3
.
for when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water.) -- 1 kings 18:4
.
Then Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill some of the cattle." -- 1 kings 18:5
.
So they divided the land between them to survey it; Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself. -- 1 kings 18:6
.
Now as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him, and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, "Is this you, Elijah my master?" -- 1 kings 18:7
.
He said to him, "It is I. Go, say to your master, 'Behold, Elijah is here.'" -- 1 kings 18:8
.
He said, "What sin have I committed, that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to put me to death? -- 1 kings 18:9
.
"As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to search for you; and when they said, 'He is not here,' he made the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you. -- 1 kings 18:10
.
"And now you are saying, 'Go, say to your master, "Behold, Elijah is here."' -- 1 kings 18:11
.
"It will come about when I leave you that the Spirit of the LORD will carry you where I do not know; so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth. -- 1 kings 18:12
.
"Has it not been told to my master what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, that I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water? -- 1 kings 18:13
.
"And now you are saying, 'Go, say to your master, "Behold, Elijah is here"'; he will then kill me." -- 1 kings 18:14
.
Elijah said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today." -- 1 kings 18:15
.
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. -- 1 kings 18:16
.
When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, "Is this you, you troubler of Israel?" -- 1 kings 18:17
.
He said, "I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father's house have, because you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and you have followed the Baals. -- 1 kings 18:18
.
"Now then send and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, together with prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table." -- 1 kings 18:19
.
So Ahab sent a message among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel. -- 1 kings 18:20
.
Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him." But the people did not answer him a word. -- 1 kings 18:21
.
Then Elijah said to the people, "I alone am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal's prophets are men. -- 1 kings 18:22
.
"Now let them give us two oxen; and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up, and place it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood, and I will not put a fire under it. -- 1 kings 18:23
.
"Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, He is God." And all the people said, "That is a good idea." -- 1 kings 18:24
.
So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it." -- 1 kings 18:25
.
Then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying, "O Baal, answer us." But there was no voice and no one answered. And they leaped about the altar which they made. -- 1 kings 18:26
.
It came about at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, "Call out with a loud voice, for he is a god; either he is occupied or gone aside, or is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened." -- 1 kings 18:27
.
So they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them. -- 1 kings 18:28
.
When midday was past, they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice; but there was no voice, no one answered, and no one paid attention. -- 1 kings 18:29
.
Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come near to me." So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD which had been torn down. -- 1 kings 18:30
.
Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Israel shall be your name." -- 1 kings 18:31
.
So with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he made a trench around the altar, large enough to hold two measures of seed. -- 1 kings 18:32
.
Then he arranged the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid it on the wood. -- 1 kings 18:33
.
And he said, "Fill four pitchers with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood." And he said, "Do it a second time," and they did it a second time. And he said, "Do it a third time," and they did it a third time. -- 1 kings 18:34
.
The water flowed around the altar and he also filled the trench with water. -- 1 kings 18:35
.
At the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near and said, "O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and I have done all these things at Your word. -- 1 kings 18:36
.
"Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that You, O LORD, are God, and that You have turned their heart back again." -- 1 kings 18:37
.
Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. -- 1 kings 18:38
.
When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, "The LORD, He is God; the LORD, He is God." -- 1 kings 18:39
.
Then Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape." So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. -- 1 kings 18:40
.
Now Elijah said to Ahab, "Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower." -- 1 kings 18:41
.
So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he crouched down on the earth and put his face between his knees. -- 1 kings 18:42
.
He said to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea." So he went up and looked and said, "There is nothing." And he said, "Go back" seven times. -- 1 kings 18:43
.
It came about at the seventh time, that he said, "Behold, a cloud as small as a man's hand is coming up from the sea." And he said, "Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare your chariot and go down, so that the heavy shower does not stop you.'" -- 1 kings 18:44
.
In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy shower. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel. -- 1 kings 18:45
.
Then the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins and outran Ahab to Jezreel. -- 1 kings 18:46
.
Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. -- 1 kings 19:1
.
Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time." -- 1 kings 19:2
.
And he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. -- 1 kings 19:3
.
But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, "It is enough; now, O LORD, take my life, for I am not better than my fathers." -- 1 kings 19:4
.
He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, there was an angel touching him, and he said to him, "Arise, eat." -- 1 kings 19:5
.
Then he looked and behold, there was at his head a bread cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again. -- 1 kings 19:6
.
The angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, "Arise, eat, because the journey is too great for you." -- 1 kings 19:7
.
So he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God. -- 1 kings 19:8
.
Then he came there to a cave and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" -- 1 kings 19:9
.
He said, "I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away." -- 1 kings 19:10
.
So He said, "Go forth and stand on the mountain before the LORD." And behold, the LORD was passing by! And a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. -- 1 kings 19:11
.
After the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing. -- 1 kings 19:12
.
When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" -- 1 kings 19:13
.
Then he said, "I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away." -- 1 kings 19:14
.
The LORD said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus, and when you have arrived, you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram; -- 1 kings 19:15
.
and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place. -- 1 kings 19:16
.
"It shall come about, the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death. -- 1 kings 19:17
.
"Yet I will leave 7,in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him." -- 1 kings 19:18
.
So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, while he was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah passed over to him and threw his mantle on him. -- 1 kings 19:19
.
He left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, "Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you." And he said to him, "Go back again, for what have I done to you?" -- 1 kings 19:20
.
So he returned from following him, and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah and ministered to him. -- 1 kings 19:21
.
Now Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army, and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria and fought against it. -- 1 kings 20:1
.
Then he sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, "Thus says Ben-hadad, -- 1 kings 20:2
.
'Your silver and your gold are mine; your most beautiful wives and children are also mine.'" -- 1 kings 20:3
.
The king of Israel replied, "It is according to your word, my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have." -- 1 kings 20:4
.
Then the messengers returned and said, "Thus says Ben-hadad, 'Surely, I sent to you saying, "You shall give me your silver and your gold and your wives and your children," -- 1 kings 20:5
.
but about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will search your house and the houses of your servants; and whatever is desirable in your eyes, they will take in their hand and carry away.'" -- 1 kings 20:6
.
Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, "Please observe and see how this man is looking for trouble; for he sent to me for my wives and my children and my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him." -- 1 kings 20:7
.
All the elders and all the people said to him, "Do not listen or consent." -- 1 kings 20:8
.
So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, "Tell my lord the king, 'All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do, but this thing I cannot do.'" And the messengers departed and brought him word again. -- 1 kings 20:9
.
Ben-hadad sent to him and said, "May the gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria will suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me." -- 1 kings 20:10
.
Then the king of Israel replied, "Tell him, 'Let not him who girds on his armor boast like him who takes it off.'" -- 1 kings 20:11
.
When Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking with the kings in the temporary shelters, he said to his servants, "Station yourselves." So they stationed themselves against the city. -- 1 kings 20:12
.
Now behold, a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver them into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the LORD.'" -- 1 kings 20:13
.
Ahab said, "By whom?" So he said, "Thus says the LORD, 'By the young men of the rulers of the provinces.'" Then he said, "Who shall begin the battle?" And he answered, "You." -- 1 kings 20:14
.
Then he mustered the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and there were 232; and after them he mustered all the people, even all the sons of Israel, 7,000. -- 1 kings 20:15
.
They went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the temporary shelters with the thirty-two kings who helped him. -- 1 kings 20:16
.
The young men of the rulers of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out and they told him, saying, "Men have come out from Samaria." -- 1 kings 20:17
.
Then he said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive." -- 1 kings 20:18
.
So these went out from the city, the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and the army which followed them. -- 1 kings 20:19
.
They killed each his man; and the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, and Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen. -- 1 kings 20:20
.
The king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans with a great slaughter. -- 1 kings 20:21
.
Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, "Go, strengthen yourself and observe and see what you have to do; for at the turn of the year the king of Aram will come up against you." -- 1 kings 20:22
.
Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him, "Their gods are gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we; but rather let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they. -- 1 kings 20:23
.
"Do this thing: remove the kings, each from his place, and put captains in their place, -- 1 kings 20:24
.
and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they." And he listened to their voice and did so. -- 1 kings 20:25
.
At the turn of the year, Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. -- 1 kings 20:26
.
The sons of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went to meet them; and the sons of Israel camped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the country. -- 1 kings 20:27
.
Then a man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because the Arameans have said, "The LORD is a god of the mountains, but He is not a god of the valleys," therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.'" -- 1 kings 20:28
.
So they camped one over against the other seven days. And on the seventh day the battle was joined, and the sons of Israel killed of the Arameans 100,foot soldiers in one day. -- 1 kings 20:29
.
But the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and the wall fell on 27,men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber. -- 1 kings 20:30
.
His servants said to him, "Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings, please let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save your life." -- 1 kings 20:31
.
So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please let me live.'" And he said, "Is he still alive? He is my brother." -- 1 kings 20:32
.
Now the men took this as an omen, and quickly catching his word said, "Your brother Ben-hadad." Then he said, "Go, bring him." Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he took him up into the chariot. -- 1 kings 20:33
.
Ben-hadad said to him, "The cities which my father took from your father I will restore, and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria." Ahab said, "And I will let you go with this covenant." So he made a covenant with him and let him go. -- 1 kings 20:34
.
Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of the LORD, "Please strike me." But the man refused to strike him. -- 1 kings 20:35
.
Then he said to him, "Because you have not listened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have departed from me, a lion will kill you." And as soon as he had departed from him a lion found him and killed him. -- 1 kings 20:36
.
Then he found another man and said, "Please strike me." And the man struck him, wounding him. -- 1 kings 20:37
.
So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. -- 1 kings 20:38
.
As the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, "Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man; if for any reason he is missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.' -- 1 kings 20:39
.
"While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone." And the king of Israel said to him, "So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it." -- 1 kings 20:40
.
Then he hastily took the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him that he was of the prophets. -- 1 kings 20:41
.
He said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.'" -- 1 kings 20:42
.
So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and vexed, and came to Samaria. -- 1 kings 20:43
.
Now it came about after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. -- 1 kings 21:1
.
Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, "Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden because it is close beside my house, and I will give you a better vineyard than it in its place; if you like, I will give you the price of it in money." -- 1 kings 21:2
.
But Naboth said to Ahab, "The LORD forbid me that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers." -- 1 kings 21:3
.
So Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers." And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and ate no food. -- 1 kings 21:4
.
But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, "How is it that your spirit is so sullen that you are not eating food?" -- 1 kings 21:5
.
So he said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you a vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'" -- 1 kings 21:6
.
Jezebel his wife said to him, "Do you now reign over Israel? Arise, eat bread, and let your heart be joyful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite." -- 1 kings 21:7
.
So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal, and sent letters to the elders and to the nobles who were living with Naboth in his city. -- 1 kings 21:8
.
Now she wrote in the letters, saying, "Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people; -- 1 kings 21:9
.
and seat two worthless men before him, and let them testify against him, saying, 'You cursed God and the king.' Then take him out and stone him to death." -- 1 kings 21:10
.
So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them, just as it was written in the letters which she had sent them. -- 1 kings 21:11
.
They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people. -- 1 kings 21:12
.
Then the two worthless men came in and sat before him; and the worthless men testified against him, even against Naboth, before the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. -- 1 kings 21:13
.
Then they sent word to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned and is dead." -- 1 kings 21:14
.
When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead." -- 1 kings 21:15
.
When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. -- 1 kings 21:16
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, -- 1 kings 21:17
.
"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it. -- 1 kings 21:18
.
"You shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "Have you murdered and also taken possession?"' And you shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth the dogs will lick up your blood, even yours."'" -- 1 kings 21:19
.
Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" And he answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD. -- 1 kings 21:20
.
"Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel; -- 1 kings 21:21
.
and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and because you have made Israel sin. -- 1 kings 21:22
.
"Of Jezebel also has the LORD spoken, saying, 'The dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel.' -- 1 kings 21:23
.
"The one belonging to Ahab, who dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and the one who dies in the field the birds of heaven will eat." -- 1 kings 21:24
.
Surely there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife incited him. -- 1 kings 21:25
.
He acted very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the sons of Israel. -- 1 kings 21:26
.
It came about when Ahab heard these words, that he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and fasted, and he lay in sackcloth and went about despondently. -- 1 kings 21:27
.
Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, -- 1 kings 21:28
.
"Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but I will bring the evil upon his house in his son's days." -- 1 kings 21:29
.
Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. -- 1 kings 22:1
.
In the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. -- 1 kings 22:2
.
Now the king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we are still doing nothing to take it out of the hand of the king of Aram?" -- 1 kings 22:3
.
And he said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?" And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses." -- 1 kings 22:4
.
Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire first for the word of the LORD." -- 1 kings 22:5
.
Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I refrain?" And they said, "Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king." -- 1 kings 22:6
.
But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not yet a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of him?" -- 1 kings 22:7
.
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." But Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king say so." -- 1 kings 22:8
.
Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah." -- 1 kings 22:9
.
Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. -- 1 kings 22:10
.
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are consumed.'" -- 1 kings 22:11
.
All the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king." -- 1 kings 22:12
.
Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, "Behold now, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably." -- 1 kings 22:13
.
But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I shall speak." -- 1 kings 22:14
.
When he came to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?" And he answered him, "Go up and succeed, and the LORD will give it into the hand of the king." -- 1 kings 22:15
.
Then the king said to him, "How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?" -- 1 kings 22:16
.
So he said, "I saw all Israel Scattered on the mountains, Like sheep which have no shepherd. And the LORD said, 'These have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.'" -- 1 kings 22:17
.
Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?" -- 1 kings 22:18
.
Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. -- 1 kings 22:19
.
"The LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said this while another said that. -- 1 kings 22:20
.
"Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.' -- 1 kings 22:21
.
"The LORD said to him, 'How?' And he said, 'I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Then He said, 'You are to entice him and also prevail. Go and do so.' -- 1 kings 22:22
.
"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the LORD has proclaimed disaster against you." -- 1 kings 22:23
.
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?" -- 1 kings 22:24
.
Micaiah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself." -- 1 kings 22:25
.
Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son; -- 1 kings 22:26
.
and say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely."'" -- 1 kings 22:27
.
Micaiah said, "If you indeed return safely the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Listen, all you people." -- 1 kings 22:28
.
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead. -- 1 kings 22:29
.
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle. -- 1 kings 22:30
.
Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone." -- 1 kings 22:31
.
So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "Surely it is the king of Israel," and they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out. -- 1 kings 22:32
.
When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. -- 1 kings 22:33
.
Now a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn around and take me out of the fight; for I am severely wounded." -- 1 kings 22:34
.
The battle raged that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot in front of the Arameans, and died at evening, and the blood from the wound ran into the bottom of the chariot. -- 1 kings 22:35
.
Then a cry passed throughout the army close to sunset, saying, "Every man to his city and every man to his country." -- 1 kings 22:36
.
So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria. -- 1 kings 22:37
.
They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots bathed themselves there), according to the word of the LORD which He spoke. -- 1 kings 22:38
.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he built and all the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 1 kings 22:39
.
So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son became king in his place. -- 1 kings 22:40
.
Now Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. -- 1 kings 22:41
.
Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. -- 1 kings 22:42
.
He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing right in the sight of the LORD. However, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. -- 1 kings 22:43
.
Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel. -- 1 kings 22:44
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might which he showed and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 1 kings 22:45
.
The remnant of the sodomites who remained in the days of his father Asa, he expelled from the land. -- 1 kings 22:46
.
Now there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king. -- 1 kings 22:47
.
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. -- 1 kings 22:48
.
Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat was not willing. -- 1 kings 22:49
.
And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place. -- 1 kings 22:50
.
Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. -- 1 kings 22:51
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. -- 1 kings 22:52
.
So he served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done. -- 1 kings 22:53
.
Now Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. -- 2 kings 1:1
.
And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria, and became ill. So he sent messengers and said to them, "Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this sickness." -- 2 kings 1:2
.
But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?' -- 2 kings 1:3
.
"Now therefore thus says the LORD, 'You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you shall surely die.'" Then Elijah departed. -- 2 kings 1:4
.
When the messengers returned to him he said to them, "Why have you returned?" -- 2 kings 1:5
.
They said to him, "A man came up to meet us and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'"'" -- 2 kings 1:6
.
He said to them, "What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?" -- 2 kings 1:7
.
They answered him, "He was a hairy man with a leather girdle bound about his loins." And he said, "It is Elijah the Tishbite." -- 2 kings 1:8
.
Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he said to him, "O man of God, the king says, 'Come down.'" -- 2 kings 1:9
.
Elijah replied to the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. -- 2 kings 1:10
.
So he again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he said to him, "O man of God, thus says the king, 'Come down quickly.'" -- 2 kings 1:11
.
Elijah replied to them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. -- 2 kings 1:12
.
So he again sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. When the third captain of fifty went up, he came and bowed down on his knees before Elijah, and begged him and said to him, "O man of God, please let my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight. -- 2 kings 1:13
.
"Behold fire came down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight." -- 2 kings 1:14
.
The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he arose and went down with him to the king. -- 2 kings 1:15
.
Then he said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron--is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word?--therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'" -- 2 kings 1:16
.
So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And because he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. -- 2 kings 1:17
.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 2 kings 1:18
.
And it came about when the LORD was about to take up Elijah by a whirlwind to heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. -- 2 kings 2:1
.
Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here please, for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel." But Elisha said, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel. -- 2 kings 2:2
.
Then the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?" And he said, "Yes, I know; be still." -- 2 kings 2:3
.
Elijah said to him, "Elisha, please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Jericho." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they came to Jericho. -- 2 kings 2:4
.
The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?" And he answered, "Yes, I know; be still." -- 2 kings 2:5
.
Then Elijah said to him, "Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So the two of them went on. -- 2 kings 2:6
.
Now fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan. -- 2 kings 2:7
.
Elijah took his mantle and folded it together and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground. -- 2 kings 2:8
.
When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you." And Elisha said, "Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me." -- 2 kings 2:9
.
He said, "You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so." -- 2 kings 2:10
.
As they were going along and talking, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind to heaven. -- 2 kings 2:11
.
Elisha saw it and cried out, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" And he saw Elijah no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. -- 2 kings 2:12
.
He also took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan. -- 2 kings 2:13
.
He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and struck the waters and said, "Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" And when he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha crossed over. -- 2 kings 2:14
.
Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite him saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him. -- 2 kings 2:15
.
They said to him, "Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men, please let them go and search for your master; perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley." And he said, "You shall not send." -- 2 kings 2:16
.
But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, "Send." They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched three days but did not find him. -- 2 kings 2:17
.
They returned to him while he was staying at Jericho; and he said to them, "Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?" -- 2 kings 2:18
.
Then the men of the city said to Elisha, "Behold now, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad and the land is unfruitful." -- 2 kings 2:19
.
He said, "Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it." So they brought it to him. -- 2 kings 2:20
.
He went out to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'I have purified these waters; there shall not be from there death or unfruitfulness any longer.'" -- 2 kings 2:21
.
So the waters have been purified to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke. -- 2 kings 2:22
.
Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, "Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!" -- 2 kings 2:23
.
When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up forty-two lads of their number. -- 2 kings 2:24
.
He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria. -- 2 kings 2:25
.
Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. -- 2 kings 3:1
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, though not like his father and his mother; for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal which his father had made. -- 2 kings 3:2
.
Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin; he did not depart from them. -- 2 kings 3:3
.
Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and used to pay the king of Israel 100,lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams. -- 2 kings 3:4
.
But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. -- 2 kings 3:5
.
And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. -- 2 kings 3:6
.
Then he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" And he said, "I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses." -- 2 kings 3:7
.
He said, "Which way shall we go up?" And he answered, "The way of the wilderness of Edom." -- 2 kings 3:8
.
So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey, and there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them. -- 2 kings 3:9
.
Then the king of Israel said, "Alas! For the LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab." -- 2 kings 3:10
.
But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?" And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah." -- 2 kings 3:11
.
Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. -- 2 kings 3:12
.
Now Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother." And the king of Israel said to him, "No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to give them into the hand of Moab." -- 2 kings 3:13
.
Elisha said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look at you nor see you. -- 2 kings 3:14
.
"But now bring me a minstrel." And it came about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. -- 2 kings 3:15
.
He said, "Thus says the LORD, 'Make this valley full of trenches.' -- 2 kings 3:16
.
"For thus says the LORD, 'You shall not see wind nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, both you and your cattle and your beasts. -- 2 kings 3:17
.
'This is but a slight thing in the sight of the LORD; He will also give the Moabites into your hand. -- 2 kings 3:18
.
'Then you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and fell every good tree and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.'" -- 2 kings 3:19
.
It happened in the morning about the time of offering the sacrifice, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. -- 2 kings 3:20
.
Now all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. And all who were able to put on armor and older were summoned and stood on the border. -- 2 kings 3:21
.
They rose early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood. -- 2 kings 3:22
.
Then they said, "This is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and they have slain one another. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!" -- 2 kings 3:23
.
But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites arose and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land, slaughtering the Moabites. -- 2 kings 3:24
.
Thus they destroyed the cities; and each one threw a stone on every piece of good land and filled it. So they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left its stones; however, the slingers went about it and struck it. -- 2 kings 3:25
.
When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not. -- 2 kings 3:26
.
Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land. -- 2 kings 3:27
.
Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD; and the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves." -- 2 kings 4:1
.
Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" And she said, "Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil." -- 2 kings 4:2
.
Then he said, "Go, borrow vessels at large for yourself from all your neighbors, even empty vessels; do not get a few. -- 2 kings 4:3
.
"And you shall go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all these vessels, and you shall set aside what is full." -- 2 kings 4:4
.
So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons; they were bringing the vessels to her and she poured. -- 2 kings 4:5
.
When the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." And he said to her, "There is not one vessel more." And the oil stopped. -- 2 kings 4:6
.
Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you and your sons can live on the rest." -- 2 kings 4:7
.
Now there came a day when Elisha passed over to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman, and she persuaded him to eat food. And so it was, as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat food. -- 2 kings 4:8
.
She said to her husband, "Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God passing by us continually. -- 2 kings 4:9
.
"Please, let us make a little walled upper chamber and let us set a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he can turn in there." -- 2 kings 4:10
.
One day he came there and turned in to the upper chamber and rested. -- 2 kings 4:11
.
Then he said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this Shunammite." And when he had called her, she stood before him. -- 2 kings 4:12
.
He said to him, "Say now to her, 'Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what can I do for you? Would you be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the army?'" And she answered, "I live among my own people." -- 2 kings 4:13
.
So he said, "What then is to be done for her?" And Gehazi answered, "Truly she has no son and her husband is old." -- 2 kings 4:14
.
He said, "Call her." When he had called her, she stood in the doorway. -- 2 kings 4:15
.
Then he said, "At this season next year you will embrace a son." And she said, "No, my lord, O man of God, do not lie to your maidservant." -- 2 kings 4:16
.
The woman conceived and bore a son at that season the next year, as Elisha had said to her. -- 2 kings 4:17
.
When the child was grown, the day came that he went out to his father to the reapers. -- 2 kings 4:18
.
He said to his father, "My head, my head." And he said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother." -- 2 kings 4:19
.
When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and then died. -- 2 kings 4:20
.
She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door behind him and went out. -- 2 kings 4:21
.
Then she called to her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and return." -- 2 kings 4:22
.
He said, "Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath." And she said, "It will be well." -- 2 kings 4:23
.
Then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant, "Drive and go forward; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you." -- 2 kings 4:24
.
So she went and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his servant, "Behold, there is the Shunammite. -- 2 kings 4:25
.
"Please run now to meet her and say to her, 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'" And she answered, "It is well." -- 2 kings 4:26
.
When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away; but the man of God said, "Let her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me." -- 2 kings 4:27
.
Then she said, "Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, 'Do not deceive me'?" -- 2 kings 4:28
.
Then he said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand, and go your way; if you meet any man, do not salute him, and if anyone salutes you, do not answer him; and lay my staff on the lad's face." -- 2 kings 4:29
.
The mother of the lad said, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." And he arose and followed her. -- 2 kings 4:30
.
Then Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the lad's face, but there was no sound or response. So he returned to meet him and told him, "The lad has not awakened." -- 2 kings 4:31
.
When Elisha came into the house, behold the lad was dead and laid on his bed. -- 2 kings 4:32
.
So he entered and shut the door behind them both and prayed to the LORD. -- 2 kings 4:33
.
And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands, and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child became warm. -- 2 kings 4:34
.
Then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth, and went up and stretched himself on him; and the lad sneezed seven times and the lad opened his eyes. -- 2 kings 4:35
.
He called Gehazi and said, "Call this Shunammite." So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, "Take up your son." -- 2 kings 4:36
.
Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground, and she took up her son and went out. -- 2 kings 4:37
.
When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets." -- 2 kings 4:38
.
Then one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, for they did not know what they were. -- 2 kings 4:39
.
So they poured it out for the men to eat. And as they were eating of the stew, they cried out and said, "O man of God, there is death in the pot." And they were unable to eat. -- 2 kings 4:40
.
But he said, "Now bring meal." He threw it into the pot and said, "Pour it out for the people that they may eat." Then there was no harm in the pot. -- 2 kings 4:41
.
Now a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, "Give them to the people that they may eat." -- 2 kings 4:42
.
His attendant said, "What, will I set this before a hundred men?" But he said, "Give them to the people that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, 'They shall eat and have some left over.'" -- 2 kings 4:43
.
So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD. -- 2 kings 4:44
.
Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and highly respected, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man was also a valiant warrior, but he was a leper. -- 2 kings 5:1
.
Now the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she waited on Naaman's wife. -- 2 kings 5:2
.
She said to her mistress, "I wish that my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy." -- 2 kings 5:3
.
Naaman went in and told his master, saying, "Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel." -- 2 kings 5:4
.
Then the king of Aram said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel." He departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothes. -- 2 kings 5:5
.
He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, "And now as this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy." -- 2 kings 5:6
.
When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man is sending word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? But consider now, and see how he is seeking a quarrel against me." -- 2 kings 5:7
.
It happened when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent word to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Now let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel." -- 2 kings 5:8
.
So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha. -- 2 kings 5:9
.
Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you and you will be clean." -- 2 kings 5:10
.
But Naaman was furious and went away and said, "Behold, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.' -- 2 kings 5:11
.
"Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage. -- 2 kings 5:12
.
Then his servants came near and spoke to him and said, "My father, had the prophet told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean'?" -- 2 kings 5:13
.
So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child and he was clean. -- 2 kings 5:14
.
When he returned to the man of God with all his company, and came and stood before him, he said, "Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel; so please take a present from your servant now." -- 2 kings 5:15
.
But he said, "As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will take nothing." And he urged him to take it, but he refused. -- 2 kings 5:16
.
Naaman said, "If not, please let your servant at least be given two mules' load of earth; for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering nor will he sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD. -- 2 kings 5:17
.
"In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter." -- 2 kings 5:18
.
He said to him, "Go in peace." So he departed from him some distance. -- 2 kings 5:19
.
But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, "Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, by not receiving from his hands what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him." -- 2 kings 5:20
.
So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and said, "Is all well?" -- 2 kings 5:21
.
He said, "All is well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.'" -- 2 kings 5:22
.
Naaman said, "Be pleased to take two talents." And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him. -- 2 kings 5:23
.
When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed. -- 2 kings 5:24
.
But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" And he said, "Your servant went nowhere." -- 2 kings 5:25
.
Then he said to him, "Did not my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money and to receive clothes and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male and female servants? -- 2 kings 5:26
.
"Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever." So he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow. -- 2 kings 5:27
.
Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Behold now, the place before you where we are living is too limited for us. -- 2 kings 6:1
.
"Please let us go to the Jordan and each of us take from there a beam, and let us make a place there for ourselves where we may live." So he said, "Go." -- 2 kings 6:2
.
Then one said, "Please be willing to go with your servants." And he answered, "I shall go." -- 2 kings 6:3
.
So he went with them; and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. -- 2 kings 6:4
.
But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, "Alas, my master! For it was borrowed." -- 2 kings 6:5
.
Then the man of God said, "Where did it fall?" And when he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there, and made the iron float. -- 2 kings 6:6
.
He said, "Take it up for yourself." So he put out his hand and took it. -- 2 kings 6:7
.
Now the king of Aram was warring against Israel; and he counseled with his servants saying, "In such and such a place shall be my camp." -- 2 kings 6:8
.
The man of God sent word to the king of Israel saying, "Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Arameans are coming down there." -- 2 kings 6:9
.
The king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had told him; thus he warned him, so that he guarded himself there, more than once or twice. -- 2 kings 6:10
.
Now the heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, "Will you tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?" -- 2 kings 6:11
.
One of his servants said, "No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom." -- 2 kings 6:12
.
So he said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and take him." And it was told him, saying, "Behold, he is in Dothan." -- 2 kings 6:13
.
He sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. -- 2 kings 6:14
.
Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city. And his servant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?" -- 2 kings 6:15
.
So he answered, "Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them." -- 2 kings 6:16
.
Then Elisha prayed and said, "O LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see." And the LORD opened the servant's eyes and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. -- 2 kings 6:17
.
When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, "Strike this people with blindness, I pray." So He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. -- 2 kings 6:18
.
Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, nor is this the city; follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." And he brought them to Samaria. -- 2 kings 6:19
.
When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, "O LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see." So the LORD opened their eyes and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. -- 2 kings 6:20
.
Then the king of Israel when he saw them, said to Elisha, "My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?" -- 2 kings 6:21
.
He answered, "You shall not kill them. Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master." -- 2 kings 6:22
.
So he prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the marauding bands of Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel. -- 2 kings 6:23
.
Now it came about after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria. -- 2 kings 6:24
.
There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver. -- 2 kings 6:25
.
As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried out to him, saying, "Help, my lord, O king!" -- 2 kings 6:26
.
He said, "If the LORD does not help you, from where shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?" -- 2 kings 6:27
.
And the king said to her, "What is the matter with you?" And she answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.' -- 2 kings 6:28
.
"So we boiled my son and ate him; and I said to her on the next day, 'Give your son, that we may eat him'; but she has hidden her son." -- 2 kings 6:29
.
When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes--now he was passing by on the wall--and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body. -- 2 kings 6:30
.
Then he said, "May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today." -- 2 kings 6:31
.
Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man from his presence; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, "Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door shut against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?" -- 2 kings 6:32
.
While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him and he said, "Behold, this evil is from the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?" -- 2 kings 6:33
.
Then Elisha said, "Listen to the word of the LORD; thus says the LORD, 'Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.'" -- 2 kings 7:1
.
The royal officer on whose hand the king was leaning answered the man of God and said, "Behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?" Then he said, "Behold, you will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat of it." -- 2 kings 7:2
.
Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, "Why do we sit here until we die? -- 2 kings 7:3
.
"If we say, 'We will enter the city,' then the famine is in the city and we will die there; and if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we will live; and if they kill us, we will but die." -- 2 kings 7:4
.
They arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans; when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no one there. -- 2 kings 7:5
.
For the Lord had caused the army of the Arameans to hear a sound of chariots and a sound of horses, even the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, "Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us." -- 2 kings 7:6
.
Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents and their horses and their donkeys, even the camp just as it was, and fled for their life. -- 2 kings 7:7
.
When these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they entered one tent and ate and drank, and carried from there silver and gold and clothes, and went and hid them; and they returned and entered another tent and carried from there also, and went and hid them. -- 2 kings 7:8
.
Then they said to one another, "We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, but we are keeping silent; if we wait until morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household." -- 2 kings 7:9
.
So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and they told them, saying, "We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no one there, nor the voice of man, only the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents just as they were." -- 2 kings 7:10
.
The gatekeepers called and told it within the king's household. -- 2 kings 7:11
.
Then the king arose in the night and said to his servants, "I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone from the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and get into the city.'" -- 2 kings 7:12
.
One of his servants said, "Please, let some men take five of the horses which remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they will be in any case like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they will be in any case like all the multitude of Israel who have already perished, so let us send and see." -- 2 kings 7:13
.
They took therefore two chariots with horses, and the king sent after the army of the Arameans, saying, "Go and see." -- 2 kings 7:14
.
They went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the way was full of clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king. -- 2 kings 7:15
.
So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. Then a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. -- 2 kings 7:16
.
Now the king appointed the royal officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; but the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. -- 2 kings 7:17
.
It happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be sold tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria." -- 2 kings 7:18
.
Then the royal officer answered the man of God and said, "Now behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?" And he said, "Behold, you will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat of it." -- 2 kings 7:19
.
And so it happened to him, for the people trampled on him at the gate and he died. -- 2 kings 7:20
.
Now Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, "Arise and go with your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn; for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will even come on the land for seven years." -- 2 kings 8:1
.
So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God, and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. -- 2 kings 8:2
.
At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went out to appeal to the king for her house and for her field. -- 2 kings 8:3
.
Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, "Please relate to me all the great things that Elisha has done." -- 2 kings 8:4
.
As he was relating to the king how he had restored to life the one who was dead, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and for her field. And Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, this is the woman and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life." -- 2 kings 8:5
.
When the king asked the woman, she related it to him. So the king appointed for her a certain officer, saying, "Restore all that was hers and all the produce of the field from the day that she left the land even until now." -- 2 kings 8:6
.
Then Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and it was told him, saying, "The man of God has come here." -- 2 kings 8:7
.
The king said to Hazael, "Take a gift in your hand and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'" -- 2 kings 8:8
.
So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand, even every kind of good thing of Damascus, forty camels' loads; and he came and stood before him and said, "Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'" -- 2 kings 8:9
.
Then Elisha said to him, "Go, say to him, 'You will surely recover,' but the LORD has shown me that he will certainly die." -- 2 kings 8:10
.
He fixed his gaze steadily on him until he was ashamed, and the man of God wept. -- 2 kings 8:11
.
Hazael said, "Why does my lord weep?" Then he answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel: their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword, and their little ones you will dash in pieces, and their women with child you will rip up." -- 2 kings 8:12
.
Then Hazael said, "But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?" And Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram." -- 2 kings 8:13
.
So he departed from Elisha and returned to his master, who said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And he answered, "He told me that you would surely recover." -- 2 kings 8:14
.
On the following day, he took the cover and dipped it in water and spread it on his face, so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place. -- 2 kings 8:15
.
Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then the king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king. -- 2 kings 8:16
.
He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 8:17
.
He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. -- 2 kings 8:18
.
However, the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David His servant, since He had promised him to give a lamp to him through his sons always. -- 2 kings 8:19
.
In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. -- 2 kings 8:20
.
Then Joram crossed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he arose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; but his army fled to their tents. -- 2 kings 8:21
.
So Edom revolted against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. -- 2 kings 8:22
.
The rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 8:23
.
So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 8:24
.
In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. -- 2 kings 8:25
.
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. -- 2 kings 8:26
.
He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab had done, because he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab. -- 2 kings 8:27
.
Then he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram. -- 2 kings 8:28
.
So King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick. -- 2 kings 8:29
.
Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, "Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand and go to Ramoth-gilead. -- 2 kings 9:1
.
"When you arrive there, search out Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and bid him arise from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner room. -- 2 kings 9:2
.
"Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, 'Thus says the LORD, "I have anointed you king over Israel."' Then open the door and flee and do not wait." -- 2 kings 9:3
.
So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. -- 2 kings 9:4
.
When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting, and he said, "I have a word for you, O captain." And Jehu said, "For which one of us?" And he said, "For you, O captain." -- 2 kings 9:5
.
He arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel. -- 2 kings 9:6
.
'You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. -- 2 kings 9:7
.
'For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male person both bond and free in Israel. -- 2 kings 9:8
.
'I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. -- 2 kings 9:9
.
'The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her.'" Then he opened the door and fled. -- 2 kings 9:10
.
Now Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, "Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?" And he said to them, "You know very well the man and his talk." -- 2 kings 9:11
.
They said, "It is a lie, tell us now." And he said, "Thus and thus he said to me, 'Thus says the LORD, "I have anointed you king over Israel."'" -- 2 kings 9:12
.
Then they hurried and each man took his garment and placed it under him on the bare steps, and blew the trumpet, saying, "Jehu is king!" -- 2 kings 9:13
.
So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram with all Israel was defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram, -- 2 kings 9:14
.
but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. So Jehu said, "If this is your mind, then let no one escape or leave the city to go tell it in Jezreel." -- 2 kings 9:15
.
Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram. -- 2 kings 9:16
.
Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, "I see a company." And Joram said, "Take a horseman and send him to meet them and let him say, 'Is it peace?'" -- 2 kings 9:17
.
So a horseman went to meet him and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" And Jehu said, "What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me." And the watchman reported, "The messenger came to them, but he did not return." -- 2 kings 9:18
.
Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" And Jehu answered, "What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me." -- 2 kings 9:19
.
The watchman reported, "He came even to them, and he did not return; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously." -- 2 kings 9:20
.
Then Joram said, "Get ready." And they made his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. -- 2 kings 9:21
.
When Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" And he answered, "What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?" -- 2 kings 9:22
.
So Joram reined about and fled and said to Ahaziah, "There is treachery, O Ahaziah!" -- 2 kings 9:23
.
And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms; and the arrow went through his heart and he sank in his chariot. -- 2 kings 9:24
.
Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, "Take him up and cast him into the property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for I remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab his father, that the LORD laid this oracle against him: -- 2 kings 9:25
.
'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,' says the LORD, 'and I will repay you in this property,' says the LORD. Now then, take and cast him into the property, according to the word of the LORD." -- 2 kings 9:26
.
When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him and said, "Shoot him too, in the chariot." So they shot him at the ascent of Gur, which is at Ibleam. But he fled to Megiddo and died there. -- 2 kings 9:27
.
Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David. -- 2 kings 9:28
.
Now in the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah. -- 2 kings 9:29
.
When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, and she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out the window. -- 2 kings 9:30
.
As Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it well, Zimri, your master's murderer?" -- 2 kings 9:31
.
Then he lifted up his face to the window and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" And two or three officials looked down at him. -- 2 kings 9:32
.
He said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down, and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her under foot. -- 2 kings 9:33
.
When he came in, he ate and drank; and he said, "See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter." -- 2 kings 9:34
.
They went to bury her, but they found nothing more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. -- 2 kings 9:35
.
Therefore they returned and told him. And he said, "This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'In the property of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel; -- 2 kings 9:36
.
and the corpse of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field in the property of Jezreel, so they cannot say, "This is Jezebel."'" -- 2 kings 9:37
.
Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and to the guardians of the children of Ahab, saying, -- 2 kings 10:1
.
"Now, when this letter comes to you, since your master's sons are with you, as well as the chariots and horses and a fortified city and the weapons, -- 2 kings 10:2
.
select the best and fittest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house." -- 2 kings 10:3
.
But they feared greatly and said, "Behold, the two kings did not stand before him; how then can we stand?" -- 2 kings 10:4
.
And the one who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders, and the guardians of the children, sent word to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants, all that you say to us we will do, we will not make any man king; do what is good in your sight." -- 2 kings 10:5
.
Then he wrote a letter to them a second time saying, "If you are on my side, and you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men, your master's sons, and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time." Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them. -- 2 kings 10:6
.
When the letter came to them, they took the king's sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezreel. -- 2 kings 10:7
.
When the messenger came and told him, saying, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons," he said, "Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning." -- 2 kings 10:8
.
Now in the morning he went out and stood and said to all the people, "You are innocent; behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? -- 2 kings 10:9
.
"Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for the LORD has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah." -- 2 kings 10:10
.
So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him without a survivor. -- 2 kings 10:11
.
Then he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way while he was at Beth-eked of the shepherds, -- 2 kings 10:12
.
Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and said, "Who are you?" And they answered, "We are the relatives of Ahaziah; and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother." -- 2 kings 10:13
.
He said, "Take them alive." So they took them alive and killed them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them. -- 2 kings 10:14
.
Now when he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?" And Jehonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot. -- 2 kings 10:15
.
He said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." So he made him ride in his chariot. -- 2 kings 10:16
.
When he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to Elijah. -- 2 kings 10:17
.
Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much. -- 2 kings 10:18
.
"Now, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests; let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal; whoever is missing shall not live." But Jehu did it in cunning, so that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal. -- 2 kings 10:19
.
And Jehu said, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal." And they proclaimed it. -- 2 kings 10:20
.
Then Jehu sent throughout Israel and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And when they went into the house of Baal, the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other. -- 2 kings 10:21
.
He said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out garments for all the worshipers of Baal." So he brought out garments for them. -- 2 kings 10:22
.
Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, "Search and see that there is here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but only the worshipers of Baal." -- 2 kings 10:23
.
Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside, and he had said, "The one who permits any of the men whom I bring into your hands to escape shall give up his life in exchange." -- 2 kings 10:24
.
Then it came about, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the royal officers, "Go in, kill them; let none come out." And they killed them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the royal officers threw them out, and went to the inner room of the house of Baal. -- 2 kings 10:25
.
They brought out the sacred pillars of the house of Baal and burned them. -- 2 kings 10:26
.
They also broke down the sacred pillar of Baal and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day. -- 2 kings 10:27
.
Thus Jehu eradicated Baal out of Israel. -- 2 kings 10:28
.
However, as for the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin, from these Jehu did not depart, even the golden calves that were at Bethel and that were at Dan. -- 2 kings 10:29
.
The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in executing what is right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in My heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel." -- 2 kings 10:30
.
But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel sin. -- 2 kings 10:31
.
In those days the LORD began to cut off portions from Israel; and Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel: -- 2 kings 10:32
.
from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. -- 2 kings 10:33
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 2 kings 10:34
.
And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 10:35
.
Now the time which Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years. -- 2 kings 10:36
.
When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring. -- 2 kings 11:1
.
But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death. -- 2 kings 11:2
.
So he was hidden with her in the house of the LORD six years, while Athaliah was reigning over the land. -- 2 kings 11:3
.
Now in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him in the house of the LORD. Then he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son. -- 2 kings 11:4
.
He commanded them, saying, "This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, who come in on the sabbath and keep watch over the king's house -- 2 kings 11:5
.
(one third also shall be at the gate Sur, and one third at the gate behind the guards), shall keep watch over the house for defense. -- 2 kings 11:6
.
"Two parts of you, even all who go out on the sabbath, shall also keep watch over the house of the LORD for the king. -- 2 kings 11:7
.
"Then you shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within the ranks shall be put to death. And be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in." -- 2 kings 11:8
.
So the captains of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. -- 2 kings 11:9
.
The priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 11:10
.
The guards stood each with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king. -- 2 kings 11:11
.
Then he brought the king's son out and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony; and they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, "Long live the king!" -- 2 kings 11:12
.
When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people in the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 11:13
.
She looked and behold, the king was standing by the pillar, according to the custom, with the captains and the trumpeters beside the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, "Treason! Treason!" -- 2 kings 11:14
.
And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever follows her put to death with the sword." For the priest said, "Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD." -- 2 kings 11:15
.
So they seized her, and when she arrived at the horses' entrance of the king's house, she was put to death there. -- 2 kings 11:16
.
Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they would be the LORD'S people, also between the king and the people. -- 2 kings 11:17
.
All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 11:18
.
He took the captains of hundreds and the Carites and the guards and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guards to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. -- 2 kings 11:19
.
So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king's house. -- 2 kings 11:20
.
Jehoash was seven years old when he became king. -- 2 kings 11:21
.
In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba. -- 2 kings 12:1
.
Jehoash did right in the sight of the LORD all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him. -- 2 kings 12:2
.
Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. -- 2 kings 12:3
.
Then Jehoash said to the priests, "All the money of the sacred things which is brought into the house of the LORD, in current money, both the money of each man's assessment and all the money which any man's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the LORD, -- 2 kings 12:4
.
let the priests take it for themselves, each from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the damages of the house wherever any damage may be found." -- 2 kings 12:5
.
But it came about that in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damages of the house. -- 2 kings 12:6
.
Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests and said to them, "Why do you not repair the damages of the house? Now therefore take no more money from your acquaintances, but pay it for the damages of the house." -- 2 kings 12:7
.
So the priests agreed that they would take no more money from the people, nor repair the damages of the house. -- 2 kings 12:8
.
But Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid and put it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD; and the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money which was brought into the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 12:9
.
When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came up and tied it in bags and counted the money which was found in the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 12:10
.
They gave the money which was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the LORD; -- 2 kings 12:11
.
and to the masons and the stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the damages to the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. -- 2 kings 12:12
.
But there were not made for the house of the LORD silver cups, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver from the money which was brought into the house of the LORD; -- 2 kings 12:13
.
for they gave that to those who did the work, and with it they repaired the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 12:14
.
Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hand they gave the money to pay to those who did the work, for they dealt faithfully. -- 2 kings 12:15
.
The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it was for the priests. -- 2 kings 12:16
.
Then Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it, and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 12:17
.
Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things and all the gold that was found among the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent them to Hazael king of Aram. Then he went away from Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 12:18
.
Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 12:19
.
His servants arose and made a conspiracy and struck down Joash at the house of Millo as he was going down to Silla. -- 2 kings 12:20
.
For Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziah his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 12:21
.
In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel at Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years. -- 2 kings 13:1
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel sin; he did not turn from them. -- 2 kings 13:2
.
So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He gave them continually into the hand of Hazael king of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael. -- 2 kings 13:3
.
Then Jehoahaz entreated the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram oppressed them. -- 2 kings 13:4
.
The LORD gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Arameans; and the sons of Israel lived in their tents as formerly. -- 2 kings 13:5
.
Nevertheless they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria. -- 2 kings 13:6
.
For he left to Jehoahaz of the army not more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and 10,footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing. -- 2 kings 13:7
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 2 kings 13:8
.
And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 13:9
.
In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years. -- 2 kings 13:10
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel sin, but he walked in them. -- 2 kings 13:11
.
Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 2 kings 13:12
.
So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. -- 2 kings 13:13
.
When Elisha became sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" -- 2 kings 13:14
.
Elisha said to him, "Take a bow and arrows." So he took a bow and arrows. -- 2 kings 13:15
.
Then he said to the king of Israel, "Put your hand on the bow." And he put his hand on it, then Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands. -- 2 kings 13:16
.
He said, "Open the window toward the east," and he opened it. Then Elisha said, "Shoot!" And he shot. And he said, "The LORD'S arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Aram; for you will defeat the Arameans at Aphek until you have destroyed them." -- 2 kings 13:17
.
Then he said, "Take the arrows," and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground," and he struck it three times and stopped. -- 2 kings 13:18
.
So the man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have struck five or six times, then you would have struck Aram until you would have destroyed it. But now you shall strike Aram only three times." -- 2 kings 13:19
.
Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites would invade the land in the spring of the year. -- 2 kings 13:20
.
As they were burying a man, behold, they saw a marauding band; and they cast the man into the grave of Elisha. And when the man touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet. -- 2 kings 13:21
.
Now Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. -- 2 kings 13:22
.
But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned to them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence until now. -- 2 kings 13:23
.
When Hazael king of Aram died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 13:24
.
Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken in war from the hand of Jehoahaz his father. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel. -- 2 kings 13:25
.
In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah became king. -- 2 kings 14:1
.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 14:2
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father; he did according to all that Joash his father had done. -- 2 kings 14:3
.
Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. -- 2 kings 14:4
.
Now it came about, as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father. -- 2 kings 14:5
.
But the sons of the slayers he did not put to death, according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the LORD commanded, saying, "The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, nor the sons be put to death for the fathers; but each shall be put to death for his own sin." -- 2 kings 14:6
.
He killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt 10,and took Sela by war, and named it Joktheel to this day. -- 2 kings 14:7
.
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us face each other." -- 2 kings 14:8
.
Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trampled the thorn bush. -- 2 kings 14:9
.
"You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become proud. Enjoy your glory and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, would fall, and Judah with you?" -- 2 kings 14:10
.
But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. -- 2 kings 14:11
.
Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent. -- 2 kings 14:12
.
Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, cubits. -- 2 kings 14:13
.
He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. -- 2 kings 14:14
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 2 kings 14:15
.
So Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 14:16
.
Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. -- 2 kings 14:17
.
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 14:18
.
They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. -- 2 kings 14:19
.
Then they brought him on horses and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. -- 2 kings 14:20
.
All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. -- 2 kings 14:21
.
He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers. -- 2 kings 14:22
.
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel became king in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years. -- 2 kings 14:23
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin. -- 2 kings 14:24
.
He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher. -- 2 kings 14:25
.
For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, which was very bitter; for there was neither bond nor free, nor was there any helper for Israel. -- 2 kings 14:26
.
The LORD did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. -- 2 kings 14:27
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might, how he fought and how he recovered for Israel, Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 2 kings 14:28
.
And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 14:29
.
In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah became king. -- 2 kings 15:1
.
He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 15:2
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. -- 2 kings 15:3
.
Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. -- 2 kings 15:4
.
The LORD struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death. And he lived in a separate house, while Jotham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land. -- 2 kings 15:5
.
Now the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 15:6
.
And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Jotham his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 15:7
.
In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in Samaria for six months. -- 2 kings 15:8
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin. -- 2 kings 15:9
.
Then Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him and struck him before the people and killed him, and reigned in his place. -- 2 kings 15:10
.
Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. -- 2 kings 15:11
.
This is the word of the LORD which He spoke to Jehu, saying, "Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel." And so it was. -- 2 kings 15:12
.
Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samaria. -- 2 kings 15:13
.
Then Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, and killed him and became king in his place. -- 2 kings 15:14
.
Now the rest of the acts of Shallum and his conspiracy which he made, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. -- 2 kings 15:15
.
Then Menahem struck Tiphsah and all who were in it and its borders from Tirzah, because they did not open to him; therefore he struck it and ripped up all its women who were with child. -- 2 kings 15:16
.
In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel and reigned ten years in Samaria. -- 2 kings 15:17
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin. -- 2 kings 15:18
.
Pul, king of Assyria, came against the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his rule. -- 2 kings 15:19
.
Then Menahem exacted the money from Israel, even from all the mighty men of wealth, from each man fifty shekels of silver to pay the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned and did not remain there in the land. -- 2 kings 15:20
.
Now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? -- 2 kings 15:21
.
And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 15:22
.
In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years. -- 2 kings 15:23
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin. -- 2 kings 15:24
.
Then Pekah son of Remaliah, his officer, conspired against him and struck him in Samaria, in the castle of the king's house with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites, and he killed him and became king in his place. -- 2 kings 15:25
.
Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. -- 2 kings 15:26
.
In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. -- 2 kings 15:27
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin. -- 2 kings 15:28
.
In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon and Abel-beth-maacah and Janoah and Kedesh and Hazor and Gilead and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria. -- 2 kings 15:29
.
And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him and put him to death and became king in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. -- 2 kings 15:30
.
Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. -- 2 kings 15:31
.
In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah became king. -- 2 kings 15:32
.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. -- 2 kings 15:33
.
He did what was right in the sight of the LORD; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. -- 2 kings 15:34
.
Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 15:35
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 15:36
.
In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah. -- 2 kings 15:37
.
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 15:38
.
In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, became king. -- 2 kings 16:1
.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, as his father David had done. -- 2 kings 16:2
.
But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out from before the sons of Israel. -- 2 kings 16:3
.
He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree. -- 2 kings 16:4
.
Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to wage war; and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. -- 2 kings 16:5
.
At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, and cleared the Judeans out of Elath entirely; and the Arameans came to Elath and have lived there to this day. -- 2 kings 16:6
.
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son; come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me." -- 2 kings 16:7
.
Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house, and sent a present to the king of Assyria. -- 2 kings 16:8
.
So the king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and captured it, and carried the people of it away into exile to Kir, and put Rezin to death. -- 2 kings 16:9
.
Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar which was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the pattern of the altar and its model, according to all its workmanship. -- 2 kings 16:10
.
So Urijah the priest built an altar; according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, thus Urijah the priest made it, before the coming of King Ahaz from Damascus. -- 2 kings 16:11
.
When the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar; then the king approached the altar and went up to it, -- 2 kings 16:12
.
and burned his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. -- 2 kings 16:13
.
The bronze altar, which was before the LORD, he brought from the front of the house, from between his altar and the house of the LORD, and he put it on the north side of his altar. -- 2 kings 16:14
.
Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, "Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meal offering and the king's burnt offering and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meal offering and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by." -- 2 kings 16:15
.
So Urijah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded. -- 2 kings 16:16
.
Then King Ahaz cut off the borders of the stands, and removed the laver from them; he also took down the sea from the bronze oxen which were under it and put it on a pavement of stone. -- 2 kings 16:17
.
The covered way for the sabbath which they had built in the house, and the outer entry of the king, he removed from the house of the LORD because of the king of Assyria. -- 2 kings 16:18
.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 16:19
.
So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place. -- 2 kings 16:20
.
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned nine years. -- 2 kings 17:1
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him. -- 2 kings 17:2
.
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute. -- 2 kings 17:3
.
But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, who had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; so the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison. -- 2 kings 17:4
.
Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years. -- 2 kings 17:5
.
In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and settled them in Halah and Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. -- 2 kings 17:6
.
Now this came about because the sons of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and they had feared other gods -- 2 kings 17:7
.
and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel, and in the customs of the kings of Israel which they had introduced. -- 2 kings 17:8
.
The sons of Israel did things secretly which were not right against the LORD their God. Moreover, they built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city. -- 2 kings 17:9
.
They set for themselves sacred pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree, -- 2 kings 17:10
.
and there they burned incense on all the high places as the nations did which the LORD had carried away to exile before them; and they did evil things provoking the LORD. -- 2 kings 17:11
.
They served idols, concerning which the LORD had said to them, "You shall not do this thing." -- 2 kings 17:12
.
Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah through all His prophets and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments, My statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you through My servants the prophets." -- 2 kings 17:13
.
However, they did not listen, but stiffened their neck like their fathers, who did not believe in the LORD their God. -- 2 kings 17:14
.
They rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers and His warnings with which He warned them. And they followed vanity and became vain, and went after the nations which surrounded them, concerning which the LORD had commanded them not to do like them. -- 2 kings 17:15
.
They forsook all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal. -- 2 kings 17:16
