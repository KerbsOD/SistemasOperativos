Then they made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, and practiced divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him. -- 2 kings 17:17
.
So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from His sight; none was left except the tribe of Judah. -- 2 kings 17:18
.
Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs which Israel had introduced. -- 2 kings 17:19
.
The LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them out of His sight. -- 2 kings 17:20
.
When He had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the LORD and made them commit a great sin. -- 2 kings 17:21
.
The sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them -- 2 kings 17:22
.
until the LORD removed Israel from His sight, as He spoke through all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away into exile from their own land to Assyria until this day. -- 2 kings 17:23
.
The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Avva and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the sons of Israel. So they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities. -- 2 kings 17:24
.
At the beginning of their living there, they did not fear the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them which killed some of them. -- 2 kings 17:25
.
So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations whom you have carried away into exile in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the god of the land; so he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them because they do not know the custom of the god of the land." -- 2 kings 17:26
.
Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, "Take there one of the priests whom you carried away into exile and let him go and live there; and let him teach them the custom of the god of the land." -- 2 kings 17:27
.
So one of the priests whom they had carried away into exile from Samaria came and lived at Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. -- 2 kings 17:28
.
But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the houses of the high places which the people of Samaria had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived. -- 2 kings 17:29
.
The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, -- 2 kings 17:30
.
and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim. -- 2 kings 17:31
.
They also feared the LORD and appointed from among themselves priests of the high places, who acted for them in the houses of the high places. -- 2 kings 17:32
.
They feared the LORD and served their own gods according to the custom of the nations from among whom they had been carried away into exile. -- 2 kings 17:33
.
To this day they do according to the earlier customs: they do not fear the LORD, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances or the law, or the commandments which the LORD commanded the sons of Jacob, whom He named Israel; -- 2 kings 17:34
.
with whom the LORD made a covenant and commanded them, saying, "You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them. -- 2 kings 17:35
.
"But the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, and to Him you shall bow yourselves down, and to Him you shall sacrifice. -- 2 kings 17:36
.
"The statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which He wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever; and you shall not fear other gods. -- 2 kings 17:37
.
"The covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods. -- 2 kings 17:38
.
"But the LORD your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies." -- 2 kings 17:39
.
However, they did not listen, but they did according to their earlier custom. -- 2 kings 17:40
.
So while these nations feared the LORD, they also served their idols; their children likewise and their grandchildren, as their fathers did, so they do to this day. -- 2 kings 17:41
.
Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea, the son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king. -- 2 kings 18:1
.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. -- 2 kings 18:2
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done. -- 2 kings 18:3
.
He removed the high places and broke down the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan. -- 2 kings 18:4
.
He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him. -- 2 kings 18:5
.
For he clung to the LORD; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moses. -- 2 kings 18:6
.
And the LORD was with him; wherever he went he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him. -- 2 kings 18:7
.
He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city. -- 2 kings 18:8
.
Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it. -- 2 kings 18:9
.
At the end of three years they captured it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was captured. -- 2 kings 18:10
.
Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and put them in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, -- 2 kings 18:11
.
because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded; they would neither listen nor do it. -- 2 kings 18:12
.
Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them. -- 2 kings 18:13
.
Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear." So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. -- 2 kings 18:14
.
Hezekiah gave him all the silver which was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king's house. -- 2 kings 18:15
.
At that time Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. -- 2 kings 18:16
.
Then the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a large army to Jerusalem. So they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they went up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller's field. -- 2 kings 18:17
.
When they called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them. -- 2 kings 18:18
.
Then Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, "What is this confidence that you have? -- 2 kings 18:19
.
"You say (but they are only empty words), 'I have counsel and strength for the war.' Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me? -- 2 kings 18:20
.
"Now behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, even on Egypt; on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him. -- 2 kings 18:21
.
"But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem'? -- 2 kings 18:22
.
"Now therefore, come, make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. -- 2 kings 18:23
.
"How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master's servants, and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? -- 2 kings 18:24
.
"Have I now come up without the LORD'S approval against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'"'" -- 2 kings 18:25
.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, "Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall." -- 2 kings 18:26
.
But Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?" -- 2 kings 18:27
.
Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. -- 2 kings 18:28
.
"Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand; -- 2 kings 18:29
.
nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria." -- 2 kings 18:30
.
'Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, "Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern, -- 2 kings 18:31
.
until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you may live and not die." But do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you, saying, "The LORD will deliver us." -- 2 kings 18:32
.
'Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? -- 2 kings 18:33
.
'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? -- 2 kings 18:34
.
'Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?'" -- 2 kings 18:35
.
But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's commandment was, "Do not answer him." -- 2 kings 18:36
.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh. -- 2 kings 18:37
.
And when King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 19:1
.
Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. -- 2 kings 19:2
.
They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and rejection; for children have come to birth and there is no strength to deliver. -- 2 kings 19:3
.
'Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.'" -- 2 kings 19:4
.
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. -- 2 kings 19:5
.
Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD, "Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. -- 2 kings 19:6
.
"Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land."'" -- 2 kings 19:7
.
Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. -- 2 kings 19:8
.
When he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "Behold, he has come out to fight against you," he sent messengers again to Hezekiah saying, -- 2 kings 19:9
.
"Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you saying, "Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria." -- 2 kings 19:10
.
'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared? -- 2 kings 19:11
.
'Did the gods of those nations which my fathers destroyed deliver them, even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar? -- 2 kings 19:12
.
'Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?'" -- 2 kings 19:13
.
Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. -- 2 kings 19:14
.
Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. -- 2 kings 19:15
.
"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and listen to the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God. -- 2 kings 19:16
.
"Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands -- 2 kings 19:17
.
and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. -- 2 kings 19:18
.
"Now, O LORD our God, I pray, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O LORD, are God." -- 2 kings 19:19
.
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard you.' -- 2 kings 19:20
.
"This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: 'She has despised you and mocked you, The virgin daughter of Zion; She has shaken her head behind you, The daughter of Jerusalem! -- 2 kings 19:21
.
'Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice, And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! -- 2 kings 19:22
.
'Through your messengers you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, "With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I entered its farthest lodging place, its thickest forest. -- 2 kings 19:23
.
"I dug wells and drank foreign waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt." -- 2 kings 19:24
.
'Have you not heard? Long ago I did it; From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps. -- 2 kings 19:25
.
'Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up. -- 2 kings 19:26
.
'But I know your sitting down, And your going out and your coming in, And your raging against Me. -- 2 kings 19:27
.
'Because of your raging against Me, And because your arrogance has come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose, And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back by the way which you came. -- 2 kings 19:28
.
'Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. -- 2 kings 19:29
.
'The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward. -- 2 kings 19:30
.
'For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD will perform this. -- 2 kings 19:31
.
'Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, "He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield or throw up a siege ramp against it. -- 2 kings 19:32
.
"By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he shall not come to this city,"' declares the LORD. -- 2 kings 19:33
.
'For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.'" -- 2 kings 19:34
.
Then it happened that night that the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men rose early in the morning, behold, all of them were dead. -- 2 kings 19:35
.
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home, and lived at Nineveh. -- 2 kings 19:36
.
It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 19:37
.
In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.'" -- 2 kings 20:1
.
Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying, -- 2 kings 20:2
.
"Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly. -- 2 kings 20:3
.
Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, -- 2 kings 20:4
.
"Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David, "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 20:5
.
"I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David's sake."'" -- 2 kings 20:6
.
Then Isaiah said, "Take a cake of figs." And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. -- 2 kings 20:7
.
Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD the third day?" -- 2 kings 20:8
.
Isaiah said, "This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that He has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?" -- 2 kings 20:9
.
So Hezekiah answered, "It is easy for the shadow to decline ten steps; no, but let the shadow turn backward ten steps." -- 2 kings 20:10
.
Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD, and He brought the shadow on the stairway back ten steps by which it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz. -- 2 kings 20:11
.
At that time Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick. -- 2 kings 20:12
.
Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. -- 2 kings 20:13
.
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come from a far country, from Babylon." -- 2 kings 20:14
.
He said, "What have they seen in your house?" So Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them." -- 2 kings 20:15
.
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD. -- 2 kings 20:16
.
'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,' says the LORD. -- 2 kings 20:17
.
'Some of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you will beget, will be taken away; and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.'" -- 2 kings 20:18
.
Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good." For he thought, "Is it not so, if there will be peace and truth in my days?" -- 2 kings 20:19
.
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 20:20
.
So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 20:21
.
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzibah. -- 2 kings 21:1
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel. -- 2 kings 21:2
.
For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them. -- 2 kings 21:3
.
He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem I will put My name." -- 2 kings 21:4
.
For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 21:5
.
He made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and used divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD provoking Him to anger. -- 2 kings 21:6
.
Then he set the carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the LORD said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever. -- 2 kings 21:7
.
"And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them." -- 2 kings 21:8
.
But they did not listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do evil more than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel. -- 2 kings 21:9
.
Now the LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying, -- 2 kings 21:10
.
"Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, having done wickedly more than all the Amorites did who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols; -- 2 kings 21:11
.
therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am bringing such calamity on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle. -- 2 kings 21:12
.
'I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. -- 2 kings 21:13
.
'I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies, and they will become as plunder and spoil to all their enemies; -- 2 kings 21:14
.
because they have done evil in My sight, and have been provoking Me to anger since the day their fathers came from Egypt, even to this day.'" -- 2 kings 21:15
.
Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD. -- 2 kings 21:16
.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin which he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 21:17
.
And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 21:18
.
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. -- 2 kings 21:19
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done. -- 2 kings 21:20
.
For he walked in all the way that his father had walked, and served the idols that his father had served and worshiped them. -- 2 kings 21:21
.
So he forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD. -- 2 kings 21:22
.
The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house. -- 2 kings 21:23
.
Then the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. -- 2 kings 21:24
.
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 21:25
.
He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 21:26
.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. -- 2 kings 22:1
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD and walked in all the way of his father David, nor did he turn aside to the right or to the left. -- 2 kings 22:2
.
Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the house of the LORD saying, -- 2 kings 22:3
.
"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money brought in to the house of the LORD which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people. -- 2 kings 22:4
.
"Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of the LORD to repair the damages of the house, -- 2 kings 22:5
.
to the carpenters and the builders and the masons and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house. -- 2 kings 22:6
.
"Only no accounting shall be made with them for the money delivered into their hands, for they deal faithfully." -- 2 kings 22:7
.
Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan who read it. -- 2 kings 22:8
.
Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and said, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD." -- 2 kings 22:9
.
Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king. -- 2 kings 22:10
.
When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. -- 2 kings 22:11
.
Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant saying, -- 2 kings 22:12
.
"Go, inquire of the LORD for me and the people and all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD that burns against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us." -- 2 kings 22:13
.
So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her. -- 2 kings 22:14
.
She said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Tell the man who sent you to me, -- 2 kings 22:15
.
thus says the LORD, "Behold, I bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read. -- 2 kings 22:16
.
"Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore My wrath burns against this place, and it shall not be quenched."' -- 2 kings 22:17
.
"But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD thus shall you say to him, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, "Regarding the words which you have heard, -- 2 kings 22:18
.
because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I truly have heard you," declares the LORD. -- 2 kings 22:19
.
"Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place."'" So they brought back word to the king. -- 2 kings 22:20
.
Then the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 23:1
.
The king went up to the house of the LORD and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests and the prophets and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 23:2
.
The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant. -- 2 kings 23:3
.
Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel. -- 2 kings 23:4
.
He did away with the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the surrounding area of Jerusalem, also those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the host of heaven. -- 2 kings 23:5
.
He brought out the Asherah from the house of the LORD outside Jerusalem to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and ground it to dust, and threw its dust on the graves of the common people. -- 2 kings 23:6
.
He also broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which were in the house of the LORD, where the women were weaving hangings for the Asherah. -- 2 kings 23:7
.
Then he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on one's left at the city gate. -- 2 kings 23:8
.
Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers. -- 2 kings 23:9
.
He also defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire for Molech. -- 2 kings 23:10
.
He did away with the horses which the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the official, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire. -- 2 kings 23:11
.
The altars which were on the roof, the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, the king broke down; and he smashed them there and threw their dust into the brook Kidron. -- 2 kings 23:12
.
The high places which were before Jerusalem, which were on the right of the mount of destruction which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon, the king defiled. -- 2 kings 23:13
.
He broke in pieces the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherim and filled their places with human bones. -- 2 kings 23:14
.
Furthermore, the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down. Then he demolished its stones, ground them to dust, and burned the Asherah. -- 2 kings 23:15
.
Now when Josiah turned, he saw the graves that were there on the mountain, and he sent and took the bones from the graves and burned them on the altar and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things. -- 2 kings 23:16
.
Then he said, "What is this monument that I see?" And the men of the city told him, "It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel." -- 2 kings 23:17
.
He said, "Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones." So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria. -- 2 kings 23:18
.
Josiah also removed all the houses of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made provoking the LORD; and he did to them just as he had done in Bethel. -- 2 kings 23:19
.
All the priests of the high places who were there he slaughtered on the altars and burned human bones on them; then he returned to Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 23:20
.
Then the king commanded all the people saying, "Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God as it is written in this book of the covenant." -- 2 kings 23:21
.
Surely such a Passover had not been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and of the kings of Judah. -- 2 kings 23:22
.
But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 23:23
.
Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums and the spiritists and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. -- 2 kings 23:24
.
Before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him. -- 2 kings 23:25
.
However, the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath with which His anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him. -- 2 kings 23:26
.
The LORD said, "I will remove Judah also from My sight, as I have removed Israel. And I will cast off Jerusalem, this city which I have chosen, and the temple of which I said, 'My name shall be there.'" -- 2 kings 23:27
.
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 23:28
.
In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. And King Josiah went to meet him, and when Pharaoh Neco saw him he killed him at Megiddo. -- 2 kings 23:29
.
His servants drove his body in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father. -- 2 kings 23:30
.
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. -- 2 kings 23:31
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. -- 2 kings 23:32
.
Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. -- 2 kings 23:33
.
Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away and brought him to Egypt, and he died there. -- 2 kings 23:34
.
So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land in order to give the money at the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to his valuation, to give it to Pharaoh Neco. -- 2 kings 23:35
.
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. -- 2 kings 23:36
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. -- 2 kings 23:37
.
In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him. -- 2 kings 24:1
.
The LORD sent against him bands of Chaldeans, bands of Arameans, bands of Moabites, and bands of Ammonites. So He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken through His servants the prophets. -- 2 kings 24:2
.
Surely at the command of the LORD it came upon Judah, to remove them from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done, -- 2 kings 24:3
.
and also for the innocent blood which he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the LORD would not forgive. -- 2 kings 24:4
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? -- 2 kings 24:5
.
So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place. -- 2 kings 24:6
.
The king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates. -- 2 kings 24:7
.
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 24:8
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done. -- 2 kings 24:9
.
At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. -- 2 kings 24:10
.
And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it. -- 2 kings 24:11
.
Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother and his servants and his captains and his officials. So the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. -- 2 kings 24:12
.
He carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, just as the LORD had said. -- 2 kings 24:13
.
Then he led away into exile all Jerusalem and all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land. -- 2 kings 24:14
.
So he led Jehoiachin away into exile to Babylon; also the king's mother and the king's wives and his officials and the leading men of the land, he led away into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. -- 2 kings 24:15
.
All the men of valor, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths, one thousand, all strong and fit for war, and these the king of Babylon brought into exile to Babylon. -- 2 kings 24:16
.
Then the king of Babylon made his uncle Mattaniah king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah. -- 2 kings 24:17
.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. -- 2 kings 24:18
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. -- 2 kings 24:19
.
For through the anger of the LORD this came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. -- 2 kings 24:20
.
Now in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it and built a siege wall all around it. -- 2 kings 25:1
.
So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. -- 2 kings 25:2
.
On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. -- 2 kings 25:3
.
Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls beside the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah. -- 2 kings 25:4
.
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho and all his army was scattered from him. -- 2 kings 25:5
.
Then they captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and he passed sentence on him. -- 2 kings 25:6
.
They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon. -- 2 kings 25:7
.
Now on the seventh day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 25:8
.
He burned the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every great house he burned with fire. -- 2 kings 25:9
.
So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem. -- 2 kings 25:10
.
Then the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the people, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile. -- 2 kings 25:11
.
But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen. -- 2 kings 25:12
.
Now the bronze pillars which were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon. -- 2 kings 25:13
.
They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service. -- 2 kings 25:14
.
The captain of the guard also took away the firepans and the basins, what was fine gold and what was fine silver. -- 2 kings 25:15
.
The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD--the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight. -- 2 kings 25:16
.
The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a bronze capital was on it; the height of the capital was three cubits, with a network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these with network. -- 2 kings 25:17
.
Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple. -- 2 kings 25:18
.
From the city he took one official who was overseer of the men of war, and five of the king's advisers who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city. -- 2 kings 25:19
.
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. -- 2 kings 25:20
.
Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land. -- 2 kings 25:21
.
Now as for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan over them. -- 2 kings 25:22
.
When all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. -- 2 kings 25:23
.
Gedaliah swore to them and their men and said to them, "Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans; live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you." -- 2 kings 25:24
.
But it came about in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck Gedaliah down so that he died along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. -- 2 kings 25:25
.
Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. -- 2 kings 25:26
.
Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison; -- 2 kings 25:27
.
and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon. -- 2 kings 25:28
.
Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and had his meals in the king's presence regularly all the days of his life; -- 2 kings 25:29
.
and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life. -- 2 kings 25:30

Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. -- 1 chronicles 10:1
.
The Philistines closely pursued Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. -- 1 chronicles 10:2
.
The battle became heavy against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was wounded by the archers. -- 1 chronicles 10:3
.
Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword and fell on it. -- 1 chronicles 10:4
.
When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died. -- 1 chronicles 10:5
.
Thus Saul died with his three sons, and all those of his house died together. -- 1 chronicles 10:6
.
When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them. -- 1 chronicles 10:7
.
It came about the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. -- 1 chronicles 10:8
.
So they stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent messengers around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people. -- 1 chronicles 10:9
.
They put his armor in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. -- 1 chronicles 10:10
.
When all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, -- 1 chronicles 10:11
.
all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh, and they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. -- 1 chronicles 10:12
.
So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against the LORD, because of the word of the LORD which he did not keep; and also because he asked counsel of a medium, making inquiry of it, -- 1 chronicles 10:13
.
and did not inquire of the LORD. Therefore He killed him and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse. -- 1 chronicles 10:14
.
Then all Israel gathered to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. -- 1 chronicles 11:1
.
"In times past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led out and brought in Israel; and the LORD your God said to you, 'You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be prince over My people Israel.'" -- 1 chronicles 11:2
.
So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD through Samuel. -- 1 chronicles 11:3
.
Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. -- 1 chronicles 11:4
.
The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You shall not enter here." Nevertheless David captured the stronghold of Zion (that is, the city of David). -- 1 chronicles 11:5
.
Now David had said, "Whoever strikes down a Jebusite first shall be chief and commander." Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief. -- 1 chronicles 11:6
.
Then David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David. -- 1 chronicles 11:7
.
He built the city all around, from the Millo even to the surrounding area; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. -- 1 chronicles 11:8
.
David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him. -- 1 chronicles 11:9
.
Now these are the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. -- 1 chronicles 11:10
.
These constitute the list of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he killed at one time. -- 1 chronicles 11:11
.
After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. -- 1 chronicles 11:12
.
He was with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines were gathered together there to battle, and there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled before the Philistines. -- 1 chronicles 11:13
.
They took their stand in the midst of the plot and defended it, and struck down the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great victory. -- 1 chronicles 11:14
.
Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim. -- 1 chronicles 11:15
.
David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. -- 1 chronicles 11:16
.
David had a craving and said, "Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!" -- 1 chronicles 11:17
.
So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David; nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD; -- 1 chronicles 11:18
.
and he said, "Be it far from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did. -- 1 chronicles 11:19
.
As for Abshai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the thirty, and he swung his spear against three hundred and killed them; and he had a name as well as the thirty. -- 1 chronicles 11:20
.
Of the three in the second rank he was the most honored and became their commander; however, he did not attain to the first three. -- 1 chronicles 11:21
.
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, mighty in deeds, struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day. -- 1 chronicles 11:22
.
He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature five cubits tall. Now in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam, but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. -- 1 chronicles 11:23
.
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name as well as the three mighty men. -- 1 chronicles 11:24
.
Behold, he was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three; and David appointed him over his guard. -- 1 chronicles 11:25

Now these are the ones who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still restricted because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men who helped him in war. -- 1 chronicles 12:1
.
They were equipped with bows, using both the right hand and the left to sling stones and to shoot arrows from the bow; they were Saul's kinsmen from Benjamin. -- 1 chronicles 12:2
.
The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah and Jehu the Anathothite, -- 1 chronicles 12:3

.
From the Gadites there came over to David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear, and whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains. -- 1 chronicles 12:8

.
These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west. -- 1 chronicles 12:15
.
Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. -- 1 chronicles 12:16
.
David went out to meet them, and said to them, "If you come peacefully to me to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look on it and decide." -- 1 chronicles 12:17
.
Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was the chief of the thirty, and he said, "We are yours, O David, And with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, And peace to him who helps you; Indeed, your God helps you!" Then David received them and made them captains of the band. -- 1 chronicles 12:18
.
From Manasseh also some defected to David when he was about to go to battle with the Philistines against Saul. But they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines after consultation sent him away, saying, "At the cost of our heads he may defect to his master Saul." -- 1 chronicles 12:19
.
As he went to Ziklag there defected to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, captains of thousands who belonged to Manasseh. -- 1 chronicles 12:20
.
They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army. -- 1 chronicles 12:21
.
For day by day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army like the army of God. -- 1 chronicles 12:22
.
Now these are the numbers of the divisions equipped for war, who came to David at Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 12:23
.
The sons of Judah who bore shield and spear were 6,800, equipped for war. -- 1 chronicles 12:24

.
also Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty-two captains. -- 1 chronicles 12:28

.
Of the sons of Issachar, men who understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their kinsmen were at their command. -- 1 chronicles 12:32
.
Of Zebulun, there were 50,who went out in the army, who could draw up in battle formation with all kinds of weapons of war and helped David with an undivided heart. -- 1 chronicles 12:33
.
Of Naphtali there were 1,captains, and with them 37,000 with shield and spear. -- 1 chronicles 12:34

.
Of Asher there were 40,who went out in the army to draw up in battle formation. -- 1 chronicles 12:36
.
From the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites and the Gadites and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,with all kinds of weapons of war for the battle. -- 1 chronicles 12:37
.
All these, being men of war who could draw up in battle formation, came to Hebron with a perfect heart to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one mind to make David king. -- 1 chronicles 12:38
.
They were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen had prepared for them. -- 1 chronicles 12:39
.
Moreover those who were near to them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, camels, mules and on oxen, great quantities of flour cakes, fig cakes and bunches of raisins, wine, oil, oxen and sheep. There was joy indeed in Israel. -- 1 chronicles 12:40
.
Then David consulted with the captains of the thousands and the hundreds, even with every leader. -- 1 chronicles 13:1
.
David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if it is from the LORD our God, let us send everywhere to our kinsmen who remain in all the land of Israel, also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their cities with pasture lands, that they may meet with us; -- 1 chronicles 13:2
.
and let us bring back the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul." -- 1 chronicles 13:3
.
Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. -- 1 chronicles 13:4
.
So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. -- 1 chronicles 13:5
.
David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, the LORD who is enthroned above the cherubim, where His name is called. -- 1 chronicles 13:6
.
They carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. -- 1 chronicles 13:7
.
David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, even with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals and with trumpets. -- 1 chronicles 13:8
.
When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, because the oxen nearly upset it. -- 1 chronicles 13:9
.
The anger of the LORD burned against Uzza, so He struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark; and he died there before God. -- 1 chronicles 13:10
.
Then David became angry because of the LORD'S outburst against Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza to this day. -- 1 chronicles 13:11
.
David was afraid of God that day, saying, "How can I bring the ark of God home to me?" -- 1 chronicles 13:12
.
So David did not take the ark with him to the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. -- 1 chronicles 13:13
.
Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; and the LORD blessed the family of Obed-edom with all that he had. -- 1 chronicles 13:14
.
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons and carpenters, to build a house for him. -- 1 chronicles 14:1
.
And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly exalted, for the sake of His people Israel. -- 1 chronicles 14:2
.
Then David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters. -- 1 chronicles 14:3
.
These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, -- 1 chronicles 14:4
.
Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, -- 1 chronicles 14:5
.
Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, -- 1 chronicles 14:6
.
Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet. -- 1 chronicles 14:7
.
When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them. -- 1 chronicles 14:8
.
Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. -- 1 chronicles 14:9
.
David inquired of God, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will You give them into my hand?" Then the LORD said to him, "Go up, for I will give them into your hand." -- 1 chronicles 14:10
.
So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there; and David said, "God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like the breakthrough of waters." Therefore they named that place Baal-perazim. -- 1 chronicles 14:11
.
They abandoned their gods there; so David gave the order and they were burned with fire. -- 1 chronicles 14:12
.
The Philistines made yet another raid in the valley. -- 1 chronicles 14:13
.
David inquired again of God, and God said to him, "You shall not go up after them; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees. -- 1 chronicles 14:14
.
"It shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines." -- 1 chronicles 14:15
.
David did just as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even as far as Gezer. -- 1 chronicles 14:16
.
Then the fame of David went out into all the lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him on all the nations. -- 1 chronicles 14:17
.
Now David built houses for himself in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. -- 1 chronicles 15:1
.
Then David said, "No one is to carry the ark of God but the Levites; for the LORD chose them to carry the ark of God and to minister to Him forever." -- 1 chronicles 15:2
.
And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place which he had prepared for it. -- 1 chronicles 15:3
.
David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: -- 1 chronicles 15:4
.
of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and of his relatives; -- 1 chronicles 15:5
.
of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and of his relatives; -- 1 chronicles 15:6
.
of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and of his relatives; -- 1 chronicles 15:7
.
of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and of his relatives; -- 1 chronicles 15:8
.
of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and of his relatives; -- 1 chronicles 15:9
.
of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and of his relatives. -- 1 chronicles 15:10
.
Then David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab, -- 1 chronicles 15:11
.
and said to them, "You are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites; consecrate yourselves both you and your relatives, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it. -- 1 chronicles 15:12
.
"Because you did not carry it at the first, the LORD our God made an outburst on us, for we did not seek Him according to the ordinance." -- 1 chronicles 15:13
.
So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. -- 1 chronicles 15:14
.
The sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 15:15
.
Then David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers, with instruments of music, harps, lyres, loud-sounding cymbals, to raise sounds of joy. -- 1 chronicles 15:16
.
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and from his relatives, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their relatives, Ethan the son of Kushaiah, -- 1 chronicles 15:17
.
and with them their relatives of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers. -- 1 chronicles 15:18
.
So the singers, Heman, Asaph and Ethan were appointed to sound aloud cymbals of bronze; -- 1 chronicles 15:19
.
and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah, with harps tuned to alamoth; -- 1 chronicles 15:20
.
and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel and Azaziah, to lead with lyres tuned to the sheminith. -- 1 chronicles 15:21
.
Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing; he gave instruction in singing because he was skillful. -- 1 chronicles 15:22
.
Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. -- 1 chronicles 15:23
.
Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah also were gatekeepers for the ark. -- 1 chronicles 15:24
.
So it was David, with the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands, who went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy. -- 1 chronicles 15:25
.
Because God was helping the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. -- 1 chronicles 15:26
.
Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen with all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the singing with the singers. David also wore an ephod of linen. -- 1 chronicles 15:27
.
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the horn, with trumpets, with loud-sounding cymbals, with harps and lyres. -- 1 chronicles 15:28
.
It happened when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and celebrating; and she despised him in her heart. -- 1 chronicles 15:29
.
And they brought in the ark of God and placed it inside the tent which David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. -- 1 chronicles 16:1
.
When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 16:2
.
He distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread and a portion of meat and a raisin cake. -- 1 chronicles 16:3
.
He appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD, even to celebrate and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: -- 1 chronicles 16:4
.
Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom and Jeiel, with musical instruments, harps, lyres; also Asaph played loud-sounding cymbals, -- 1 chronicles 16:5
.
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. -- 1 chronicles 16:6
.
Then on that day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 16:7
.
Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples. -- 1 chronicles 16:8
.
Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; Speak of all His wonders. -- 1 chronicles 16:9
.
Glory in His holy name; Let the heart of those who seek the LORD be glad. -- 1 chronicles 16:10
.
Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually. -- 1 chronicles 16:11
.
Remember His wonderful deeds which He has done, His marvels and the judgments from His mouth, -- 1 chronicles 16:12
.
O seed of Israel His servant, Sons of Jacob, His chosen ones! -- 1 chronicles 16:13
.
He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth. -- 1 chronicles 16:14
.
Remember His covenant forever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations, -- 1 chronicles 16:15
.
The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac. -- 1 chronicles 16:16
.
He also confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant, -- 1 chronicles 16:17
.
Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, As the portion of your inheritance." -- 1 chronicles 16:18
.
When they were only a few in number, Very few, and strangers in it, -- 1 chronicles 16:19
.
And they wandered about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people, -- 1 chronicles 16:20
.
He permitted no man to oppress them, And He reproved kings for their sakes, saying, -- 1 chronicles 16:21
.
"Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm." -- 1 chronicles 16:22
.
Sing to the LORD, all the earth; Proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day. -- 1 chronicles 16:23
.
Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples. -- 1 chronicles 16:24
.
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He also is to be feared above all gods. -- 1 chronicles 16:25
.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens. -- 1 chronicles 16:26
.
Splendor and majesty are before Him, Strength and joy are in His place. -- 1 chronicles 16:27
.
Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. -- 1 chronicles 16:28
.
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; Bring an offering, and come before Him; Worship the LORD in holy array. -- 1 chronicles 16:29
.
Tremble before Him, all the earth; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved. -- 1 chronicles 16:30
.
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns." -- 1 chronicles 16:31
.
Let the sea roar, and all it contains; Let the field exult, and all that is in it. -- 1 chronicles 16:32
.
Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD; For He is coming to judge the earth. -- 1 chronicles 16:33
.
O give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting. -- 1 chronicles 16:34
.
Then say, "Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Your holy name, And glory in Your praise." -- 1 chronicles 16:35
.
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. Then all the people said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 16:36
.
So he left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required; -- 1 chronicles 16:37
.
and Obed-edom with his relatives; Obed-edom, also the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as gatekeepers. -- 1 chronicles 16:38
.
He left Zadok the priest and his relatives the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place which was at Gibeon, -- 1 chronicles 16:39
.
to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which He commanded Israel. -- 1 chronicles 16:40
.
With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His lovingkindness is everlasting. -- 1 chronicles 16:41
.
And with them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those who should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God, and the sons of Jeduthun for the gate. -- 1 chronicles 16:42
.
Then all the people departed each to his house, and David returned to bless his household. -- 1 chronicles 16:43
.
And it came about, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under curtains." -- 1 chronicles 17:1
.
Then Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you." -- 1 chronicles 17:2
.
It came about the same night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, -- 1 chronicles 17:3
.
"Go and tell David My servant, 'Thus says the LORD, "You shall not build a house for Me to dwell in; -- 1 chronicles 17:4
.
for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from one dwelling place to another. -- 1 chronicles 17:5
.
"In all places where I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, 'Why have you not built for Me a house of cedar?'"' -- 1 chronicles 17:6
.
"Now, therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be leader over My people Israel. -- 1 chronicles 17:7
.
"I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. -- 1 chronicles 17:8
.
"I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and not be moved again; and the wicked will not waste them anymore as formerly, -- 1 chronicles 17:9
.
even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I tell you that the LORD will build a house for you. -- 1 chronicles 17:10
.
"When your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up one of your descendants after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. -- 1 chronicles 17:11
.
"He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. -- 1 chronicles 17:12
.
"I will be his father and he shall be My son; and I will not take My lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you. -- 1 chronicles 17:13
.
"But I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever."'" -- 1 chronicles 17:14
.
According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. -- 1 chronicles 17:15
.
Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD and said, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far? -- 1 chronicles 17:16
.
"This was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; but You have spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the standard of a man of high degree, O LORD God. -- 1 chronicles 17:17
.
"What more can David still say to You concerning the honor bestowed on Your servant? For You know Your servant. -- 1 chronicles 17:18
.
"O LORD, for Your servant's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things. -- 1 chronicles 17:19
.
"O LORD, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. -- 1 chronicles 17:20
.
"And what one nation in the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make You a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed out of Egypt? -- 1 chronicles 17:21
.
"For Your people Israel You made Your own people forever, and You, O LORD, became their God. -- 1 chronicles 17:22
.
"Now, O LORD, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as You have spoken. -- 1 chronicles 17:23
.
"Let Your name be established and magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and the house of David Your servant is established before You.' -- 1 chronicles 17:24
.
"For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build for him a house; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray before You. -- 1 chronicles 17:25
.
"Now, O LORD, You are God, and have promised this good thing to Your servant. -- 1 chronicles 17:26
.
"And now it has pleased You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, O LORD, have blessed, and it is blessed forever." -- 1 chronicles 17:27
.
Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines. -- 1 chronicles 18:1
.
He defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute. -- 1 chronicles 18:2
.
David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath, as he went to establish his rule to the Euphrates River. -- 1 chronicles 18:3
.
David took from him 1,chariots and 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers, and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for 100 chariots. -- 1 chronicles 18:4
.
When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed 22,men of the Arameans. -- 1 chronicles 18:5
.
Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. -- 1 chronicles 18:6
.
David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. -- 1 chronicles 18:7
.
Also from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a very large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the bronze utensils. -- 1 chronicles 18:8
.
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, -- 1 chronicles 18:9
.
he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and had defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze. -- 1 chronicles 18:10
.
King David also dedicated these to the LORD with the silver and the gold which he had carried away from all the nations: from Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, and from Amalek. -- 1 chronicles 18:11
.
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah defeated 18,Edomites in the Valley of Salt. -- 1 chronicles 18:12
.
Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. -- 1 chronicles 18:13
.
So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and righteousness for all his people. -- 1 chronicles 18:14
.
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; -- 1 chronicles 18:15
.
and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was secretary; -- 1 chronicles 18:16
.
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were chiefs at the king's side. -- 1 chronicles 18:17
.
Now it came about after this, that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon died, and his son became king in his place. -- 1 chronicles 19:1
.
Then David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun to console him. -- 1 chronicles 19:2
.
But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, "Do you think that David is honoring your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?" -- 1 chronicles 19:3
.
So Hanun took David's servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away. -- 1 chronicles 19:4
.
Then certain persons went and told David about the men. And he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and then return." -- 1 chronicles 19:5
.
When the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent 1,talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and from Zobah. -- 1 chronicles 19:6
.
So they hired for themselves 32,chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to battle. -- 1 chronicles 19:7
.
When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men. -- 1 chronicles 19:8
.
The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. -- 1 chronicles 19:9
.
Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel and they arrayed themselves against the Arameans. -- 1 chronicles 19:10
.
But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abshai his brother; and they arrayed themselves against the sons of Ammon. -- 1 chronicles 19:11
.
He said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. -- 1 chronicles 19:12
.
"Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what is good in His sight." -- 1 chronicles 19:13
.
So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. -- 1 chronicles 19:14
.
When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they also fled before Abshai his brother and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. -- 1 chronicles 19:15
.
When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them. -- 1 chronicles 19:16
.
When it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came upon them and drew up in formation against them. And when David drew up in battle array against the Arameans, they fought against him. -- 1 chronicles 19:17
.
The Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed of the Arameans 7,charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death Shophach the commander of the army. -- 1 chronicles 19:18
.
So when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. Thus the Arameans were not willing to help the sons of Ammon anymore. -- 1 chronicles 19:19
.
Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the sons of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it. -- 1 chronicles 20:1
.
David took the crown of their king from his head, and he found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there was a precious stone in it; and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. -- 1 chronicles 20:2
.
He brought out the people who were in it, and cut them with saws and with sharp instruments and with axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. -- 1 chronicles 20:3
.
Now it came about after this, that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and they were subdued. -- 1 chronicles 20:4
.
And there was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. -- 1 chronicles 20:5
.
Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot; and he also was descended from the giants. -- 1 chronicles 20:6
.
When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him. -- 1 chronicles 20:7
.
These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. -- 1 chronicles 20:8
.
Then Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel. -- 1 chronicles 21:1
.
So David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, "Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, and bring me word that I may know their number." -- 1 chronicles 21:2
.
Joab said, "May the LORD add to His people a hundred times as many as they are! But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? Why does my lord seek this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt to Israel?" -- 1 chronicles 21:3
.
Nevertheless, the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore, Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. -- 1 chronicles 21:4
.
Joab gave the number of the census of all the people to David. And all Israel were 1,100,men who drew the sword; and Judah was 470,000 men who drew the sword. -- 1 chronicles 21:5
.
But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab. -- 1 chronicles 21:6
.
God was displeased with this thing, so He struck Israel. -- 1 chronicles 21:7
.
David said to God, "I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly." -- 1 chronicles 21:8
.
The LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying, -- 1 chronicles 21:9
.
"Go and speak to David, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "I offer you three things; choose for yourself one of them, which I will do to you."'" -- 1 chronicles 21:10
.
So Gad came to David and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Take for yourself -- 1 chronicles 21:11
.
either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.' Now, therefore, consider what answer I shall return to Him who sent me." -- 1 chronicles 21:12
.
David said to Gad, "I am in great distress; please let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great. But do not let me fall into the hand of man." -- 1 chronicles 21:13
.
So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel; 70,men of Israel fell. -- 1 chronicles 21:14
.
And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw and was sorry over the calamity, and said to the destroying angel, "It is enough; now relax your hand." And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. -- 1 chronicles 21:15
.
Then David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces. -- 1 chronicles 21:16
.
David said to God, "Is it not I who commanded to count the people? Indeed, I am the one who has sinned and done very wickedly, but these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand be against me and my father's household, but not against Your people that they should be plagued." -- 1 chronicles 21:17
.
Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. -- 1 chronicles 21:18
.
So David went up at the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 21:19
.
Now Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat. -- 1 chronicles 21:20
.
As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out from the threshing floor and prostrated himself before David with his face to the ground. -- 1 chronicles 21:21
.
Then David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build on it an altar to the LORD; for the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be restrained from the people." -- 1 chronicles 21:22
.
Ornan said to David, "Take it for yourself; and let my lord the king do what is good in his sight. See, I will give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for wood and the wheat for the grain offering; I will give it all." -- 1 chronicles 21:23
.
But King David said to Ornan, "No, but I will surely buy it for the full price; for I will not take what is yours for the LORD, or offer a burnt offering which costs me nothing." -- 1 chronicles 21:24
.
So David gave Ornan shekels of gold by weight for the site. -- 1 chronicles 21:25
.
Then David built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called to the LORD and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. -- 1 chronicles 21:26
.
The LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back in its sheath. -- 1 chronicles 21:27
.
At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifice there. -- 1 chronicles 21:28
.
For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were in the high place at Gibeon at that time. -- 1 chronicles 21:29
.
But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was terrified by the sword of the angel of the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 21:30
.
Then David said, "This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel." -- 1 chronicles 22:1
.
So David gave orders to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to hew out stones to build the house of God. -- 1 chronicles 22:2
.
David prepared large quantities of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gates and for the clamps, and more bronze than could be weighed; -- 1 chronicles 22:3
.
and timbers of cedar logs beyond number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought large quantities of cedar timber to David. -- 1 chronicles 22:4
.
David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD shall be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all lands. Therefore now I will make preparation for it." So David made ample preparations before his death. -- 1 chronicles 22:5
.
Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel. -- 1 chronicles 22:6
.
David said to Solomon, "My son, I had intended to build a house to the name of the LORD my God. -- 1 chronicles 22:7
.
"But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed much blood and have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to My name, because you have shed so much blood on the earth before Me. -- 1 chronicles 22:8
.
'Behold, a son will be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. -- 1 chronicles 22:9
.
'He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.' -- 1 chronicles 22:10
.
"Now, my son, the LORD be with you that you may be successful, and build the house of the LORD your God just as He has spoken concerning you. -- 1 chronicles 22:11
.
"Only the LORD give you discretion and understanding, and give you charge over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God. -- 1 chronicles 22:12
.
"Then you will prosper, if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous, do not fear nor be dismayed. -- 1 chronicles 22:13
.
"Now behold, with great pains I have prepared for the house of the LORD 100,talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for they are in great quantity; also timber and stone I have prepared, and you may add to them. -- 1 chronicles 22:14
.
"Moreover, there are many workmen with you, stonecutters and masons of stone and carpenters, and all men who are skillful in every kind of work. -- 1 chronicles 22:15
.
"Of the gold, the silver and the bronze and the iron there is no limit. Arise and work, and may the LORD be with you." -- 1 chronicles 22:16
.
David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon, saying, -- 1 chronicles 22:17
.
"Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and before His people. -- 1 chronicles 22:18
.
"Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD." -- 1 chronicles 22:19
.
Now when David reached old age, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. -- 1 chronicles 23:1
.
And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel with the priests and the Levites. -- 1 chronicles 23:2
.
The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward, and their number by census of men was 38,000. -- 1 chronicles 23:3
.
Of these, 24,were to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and 6,000 were officers and judges, -- 1 chronicles 23:4
.
and 4,were gatekeepers, and 4,000 were praising the LORD with the instruments which David made for giving praise. -- 1 chronicles 23:5
.
David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. -- 1 chronicles 23:6
.
Of the Gershonites were Ladan and Shimei. -- 1 chronicles 23:7
.
The sons of Ladan were Jehiel the first and Zetham and Joel, three. -- 1 chronicles 23:8
.
The sons of Shimei were Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' households of Ladan. -- 1 chronicles 23:9
.
The sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zina, Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. -- 1 chronicles 23:10
.
Jahath was the first and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they became a father's household, one class. -- 1 chronicles 23:11
.
The sons of Kohath were four: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. -- 1 chronicles 23:12
.
The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to sanctify him as most holy, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to Him and to bless in His name forever. -- 1 chronicles 23:13
.
But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. -- 1 chronicles 23:14
.
The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer. -- 1 chronicles 23:15
.
The son of Gershom was Shebuel the chief. -- 1 chronicles 23:16
.
The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. -- 1 chronicles 23:17
.
The son of Izhar was Shelomith the chief. -- 1 chronicles 23:18
.
The sons of Hebron were Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth. -- 1 chronicles 23:19
.
The sons of Uzziel were Micah the first and Isshiah the second. -- 1 chronicles 23:20
.
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish. -- 1 chronicles 23:21
.
Eleazar died and had no sons, but daughters only, so their brothers, the sons of Kish, took them as wives. -- 1 chronicles 23:22
.
The sons of Mushi were three: Mahli, Eder and Jeremoth. -- 1 chronicles 23:23
.
These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers' households, even the heads of the fathers' households of those of them who were counted, in the number of names by their census, doing the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from twenty years old and upward. -- 1 chronicles 23:24
.
For David said, "The LORD God of Israel has given rest to His people, and He dwells in Jerusalem forever. -- 1 chronicles 23:25
.
"Also, the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its utensils for its service." -- 1 chronicles 23:26
.
For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward. -- 1 chronicles 23:27
.
For their office is to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God, -- 1 chronicles 23:28
.
and with the showbread, and the fine flour for a grain offering, and unleavened wafers, or what is baked in the pan or what is well-mixed, and all measures of volume and size. -- 1 chronicles 23:29
.
They are to stand every morning to thank and to praise the LORD, and likewise at evening, -- 1 chronicles 23:30
.
and to offer all burnt offerings to the LORD, on the sabbaths, the new moons and the fixed festivals in the number set by the ordinance concerning them, continually before the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 23:31
.
Thus they are to keep charge of the tent of meeting, and charge of the holy place, and charge of the sons of Aaron their relatives, for the service of the house of the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 23:32
.
Now the divisions of the descendants of Aaron were these: the sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. -- 1 chronicles 24:1
.
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. -- 1 chronicles 24:2
.
David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their offices for their ministry. -- 1 chronicles 24:3
.
Since more chief men were found from the descendants of Eleazar than the descendants of Ithamar, they divided them thus: there were sixteen heads of fathers' households of the descendants of Eleazar and eight of the descendants of Ithamar, according to their fathers' households. -- 1 chronicles 24:4
.
Thus they were divided by lot, the one as the other; for they were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God, both from the descendants of Eleazar and the descendants of Ithamar. -- 1 chronicles 24:5
.
Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel the scribe, from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' households of the priests and of the Levites; one father's household taken for Eleazar and one taken for Ithamar. -- 1 chronicles 24:6
.
Now the first lot came out for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah, -- 1 chronicles 24:7
.
the third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim, -- 1 chronicles 24:8
.
the fifth for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin, -- 1 chronicles 24:9
.
the seventh for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah, -- 1 chronicles 24:10
.
the ninth for Jeshua, the tenth for Shecaniah, -- 1 chronicles 24:11
.
the eleventh for Eliashib, the twelfth for Jakim, -- 1 chronicles 24:12
.
the thirteenth for Huppah, the fourteenth for Jeshebeab, -- 1 chronicles 24:13
.
the fifteenth for Bilgah, the sixteenth for Immer, -- 1 chronicles 24:14
.
the seventeenth for Hezir, the eighteenth for Happizzez, -- 1 chronicles 24:15
.
the nineteenth for Pethahiah, the twentieth for Jehezkel, -- 1 chronicles 24:16
.
the twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul, -- 1 chronicles 24:17
.
the twenty-third for Delaiah, the twenty-fourth for Maaziah. -- 1 chronicles 24:18
.
These were their offices for their ministry when they came in to the house of the LORD according to the ordinance given to them through Aaron their father, just as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him. -- 1 chronicles 24:19
.
Now for the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. -- 1 chronicles 24:20
.
Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the first. -- 1 chronicles 24:21
.
Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. -- 1 chronicles 24:22
.
The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. -- 1 chronicles 24:23
.
Of the sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. -- 1 chronicles 24:24
.
The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. -- 1 chronicles 24:25
.
The sons of Merari, Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah, Beno. -- 1 chronicles 24:26
.
The sons of Merari: by Jaaziah were Beno, Shoham, Zaccur and Ibri. -- 1 chronicles 24:27
.
By Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. -- 1 chronicles 24:28
.
By Kish: the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel. -- 1 chronicles 24:29
.
The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers' households. -- 1 chronicles 24:30
.
These also cast lots just as their relatives the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' households of the priests and of the Levites--the head of fathers' households as well as those of his younger brother. -- 1 chronicles 24:31
.
Moreover, David and the commanders of the army set apart for the service some of the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with lyres, harps and cymbals; and the number of those who performed their service was: -- 1 chronicles 25:1
.
Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah and Asharelah; the sons of Asaph were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king. -- 1 chronicles 25:2
.
Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 25:3
.
Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth. -- 1 chronicles 25:4
.
All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer to exalt him according to the words of God, for God gave fourteen sons and three daughters to Heman. -- 1 chronicles 25:5
.
All these were under the direction of their father to sing in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, harps and lyres, for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman were under the direction of the king. -- 1 chronicles 25:6
.
Their number who were trained in singing to the LORD, with their relatives, all who were skillful, was 288. -- 1 chronicles 25:7
.
They cast lots for their duties, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the pupil. -- 1 chronicles 25:8
.
Now the first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph, the second for Gedaliah, he with his relatives and sons were twelve; -- 1 chronicles 25:9

.
Joab the son of Zeruiah had begun to count them, but did not finish; and because of this, wrath came upon Israel, and the number was not included in the account of the chronicles of King David. -- 1 chronicles 27:24

.
Then King David rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my brethren and my people; I had intended to build a permanent home for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the footstool of our God. So I had made preparations to build it. -- 1 chronicles 28:2
.
"But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for My name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.' -- 1 chronicles 28:3
.
"Yet, the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me from all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah to be a leader; and in the house of Judah, my father's house, and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel. -- 1 chronicles 28:4
.
"Of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons), He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. -- 1 chronicles 28:5
.
"He said to me, 'Your son Solomon is the one who shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be a son to Me, and I will be a father to him. -- 1 chronicles 28:6
.
'I will establish his kingdom forever if he resolutely performs My commandments and My ordinances, as is done now.' -- 1 chronicles 28:7
.
"So now, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek after all the commandments of the LORD your God so that you may possess the good land and bequeath it to your sons after you forever. -- 1 chronicles 28:8
.
"As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands every intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever. -- 1 chronicles 28:9
.
"Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be courageous and act." -- 1 chronicles 28:10
.
Then David gave to his son Solomon the plan of the porch of the temple, its buildings, its storehouses, its upper rooms, its inner rooms and the room for the mercy seat; -- 1 chronicles 28:11
.
and the plan of all that he had in mind, for the courts of the house of the LORD, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the storehouses of the house of God and for the storehouses of the dedicated things; -- 1 chronicles 28:12
.
also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD and for all the utensils of service in the house of the LORD; -- 1 chronicles 28:13
.
for the golden utensils, the weight of gold for all utensils for every kind of service; for the silver utensils, the weight of silver for all utensils for every kind of service; -- 1 chronicles 28:14
.
and the weight of gold for the golden lampstands and their golden lamps, with the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for the silver lampstands, with the weight of each lampstand and its lamps according to the use of each lampstand; -- 1 chronicles 28:15
.
and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for each table; and silver for the silver tables; -- 1 chronicles 28:16
.
and the forks, the basins, and the pitchers of pure gold; and for the golden bowls with the weight for each bowl; and for the silver bowls with the weight for each bowl; -- 1 chronicles 28:17
.
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the model of the chariot, even the cherubim that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. -- 1 chronicles 28:18
.
"All this," said David, "the LORD made me understand in writing by His hand upon me, all the details of this pattern." -- 1 chronicles 28:19
.
Then David said to his son Solomon, "Be strong and courageous, and act; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished. -- 1 chronicles 28:20
.
"Now behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God, and every willing man of any skill will be with you in all the work for all kinds of service. The officials also and all the people will be entirely at your command." -- 1 chronicles 28:21
.
Then King David said to the entire assembly, "My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced and the work is great; for the temple is not for man, but for the LORD God. -- 1 chronicles 29:1
.
"Now with all my ability I have provided for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, onyx stones and inlaid stones, stones of antimony and stones of various colors, and all kinds of precious stones and alabaster in abundance. -- 1 chronicles 29:2
.
"Moreover, in my delight in the house of my God, the treasure I have of gold and silver, I give to the house of my God, over and above all that I have already provided for the holy temple, -- 1 chronicles 29:3
.
namely, 3,talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings; -- 1 chronicles 29:4
.
of gold for the things of gold and of silver for the things of silver, that is, for all the work done by the craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the LORD?" -- 1 chronicles 29:5
.
Then the rulers of the fathers' households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the overseers over the king's work, offered willingly; -- 1 chronicles 29:6
.
and for the service for the house of God they gave 5,talents and 10,000 darics of gold, and 10,000 talents of silver, and 18,000 talents of brass, and 100,000 talents of iron. -- 1 chronicles 29:7
.
Whoever possessed precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in care of Jehiel the Gershonite. -- 1 chronicles 29:8
.
Then the people rejoiced because they had offered so willingly, for they made their offering to the LORD with a whole heart, and King David also rejoiced greatly. -- 1 chronicles 29:9
.
So David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly; and David said, "Blessed are You, O LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever. -- 1 chronicles 29:10
.
"Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth; Yours is the dominion, O LORD, and You exalt Yourself as head over all. -- 1 chronicles 29:11
.
"Both riches and honor come from You, and You rule over all, and in Your hand is power and might; and it lies in Your hand to make great and to strengthen everyone. -- 1 chronicles 29:12
.
"Now therefore, our God, we thank You, and praise Your glorious name. -- 1 chronicles 29:13
.
"But who am I and who are my people that we should be able to offer as generously as this? For all things come from You, and from Your hand we have given You. -- 1 chronicles 29:14
.
"For we are sojourners before You, and tenants, as all our fathers were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope. -- 1 chronicles 29:15
.
"O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy name, it is from Your hand, and all is Yours. -- 1 chronicles 29:16
.
"Since I know, O my God, that You try the heart and delight in uprightness, I, in the integrity of my heart, have willingly offered all these things; so now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here, make their offerings willingly to You. -- 1 chronicles 29:17
.
"O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, our fathers, preserve this forever in the intentions of the heart of Your people, and direct their heart to You; -- 1 chronicles 29:18
.
and give to my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies and Your statutes, and to do them all, and to build the temple, for which I have made provision." -- 1 chronicles 29:19
.
Then David said to all the assembly, "Now bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed low and did homage to the LORD and to the king. -- 1 chronicles 29:20
.
On the next day they made sacrifices to the LORD and offered burnt offerings to the LORD, 1,bulls, 1,000 rams and 1,000 lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. -- 1 chronicles 29:21
.
So they ate and drank that day before the LORD with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and they anointed him as ruler for the LORD and Zadok as priest. -- 1 chronicles 29:22
.
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father; and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. -- 1 chronicles 29:23
.
All the officials, the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David pledged allegiance to King Solomon. -- 1 chronicles 29:24
.
The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him royal majesty which had not been on any king before him in Israel. -- 1 chronicles 29:25
.
Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. -- 1 chronicles 29:26
.
The period which he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years and in Jerusalem thirty-three years. -- 1 chronicles 29:27
.
Then he died in a ripe old age, full of days, riches and honor; and his son Solomon reigned in his place. -- 1 chronicles 29:28
.
Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer, in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the chronicles of Gad the seer, -- 1 chronicles 29:29
.
with all his reign, his power, and the circumstances which came on him, on Israel, and on all the kingdoms of the lands. -- 1 chronicles 29:30
.
Now Solomon the son of David established himself securely over his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and exalted him greatly. -- 2 chronicles 1:1
.
Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' households. -- 2 chronicles 1:2
.
Then Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place which was at Gibeon, for God's tent of meeting was there, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. -- 2 chronicles 1:3
.
However, David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 1:4
.
Now the bronze altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD, and Solomon and the assembly sought it out. -- 2 chronicles 1:5
.
Solomon went up there before the LORD to the bronze altar which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it. -- 2 chronicles 1:6
.
In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you." -- 2 chronicles 1:7
.
Solomon said to God, "You have dealt with my father David with great lovingkindness, and have made me king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 1:8
.
"Now, O LORD God, Your promise to my father David is fulfilled, for You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. -- 2 chronicles 1:9
.
"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of Yours?" -- 2 chronicles 1:10
.
God said to Solomon, "Because you had this in mind, and did not ask for riches, wealth or honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor have you even asked for long life, but you have asked for yourself wisdom and knowledge that you may rule My people over whom I have made you king, -- 2 chronicles 1:11
.
wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. And I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you has possessed nor those who will come after you." -- 2 chronicles 1:12
.
So Solomon went from the high place which was at Gibeon, from the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem, and he reigned over Israel. -- 2 chronicles 1:13
.
Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen. He had 1,chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 1:14
.
The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland. -- 2 chronicles 1:15
.
Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue; the king's traders procured them from Kue for a price. -- 2 chronicles 1:16
.
They imported chariots from Egypt for shekels of silver apiece and horses for 150 apiece, and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram. -- 2 chronicles 1:17
.
Now Solomon decided to build a house for the name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself. -- 2 chronicles 2:1
.
So Solomon assigned 70,men to carry loads and 80,000 men to quarry stone in the mountains and 3,600 to supervise them. -- 2 chronicles 2:2
.
Then Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, "As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedars to build him a house to dwell in, so do for me. -- 2 chronicles 2:3
.
"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, dedicating it to Him, to burn fragrant incense before Him and to set out the showbread continually, and to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, on sabbaths and on new moons and on the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, this being required forever in Israel. -- 2 chronicles 2:4
.
"The house which I am about to build will be great, for greater is our God than all the gods. -- 2 chronicles 2:5
.
"But who is able to build a house for Him, for the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him? So who am I, that I should build a house for Him, except to burn incense before Him? -- 2 chronicles 2:6
.
"Now send me a skilled man to work in gold, silver, brass and iron, and in purple, crimson and violet fabrics, and who knows how to make engravings, to work with the skilled men whom I have in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. -- 2 chronicles 2:7
.
"Send me also cedar, cypress and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber of Lebanon; and indeed my servants will work with your servants, -- 2 chronicles 2:8
.
to prepare timber in abundance for me, for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful. -- 2 chronicles 2:9
.
"Now behold, I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, 20,kors of crushed wheat and 20,000 kors of barley, and 20,000 baths of wine and 20,000 baths of oil." -- 2 chronicles 2:10
.
Then Huram, king of Tyre, answered in a letter sent to Solomon: "Because the LORD loves His people, He has made you king over them." -- 2 chronicles 2:11
.
Then Huram continued, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a house for the LORD and a royal palace for himself. -- 2 chronicles 2:12
.
"Now I am sending Huram-abi, a skilled man, endowed with understanding, -- 2 chronicles 2:13
.
the son of a Danite woman and a Tyrian father, who knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone and wood, and in purple, violet, linen and crimson fabrics, and who knows how to make all kinds of engravings and to execute any design which may be assigned to him, to work with your skilled men and with those of my lord David your father. -- 2 chronicles 2:14
.
"Now then, let my lord send to his servants wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which he has spoken. -- 2 chronicles 2:15
.
"We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may carry it up to Jerusalem." -- 2 chronicles 2:16
.
Solomon numbered all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, following the census which his father David had taken; and 153,were found. -- 2 chronicles 2:17
.
He appointed 70,of them to carry loads and 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains and 3,600 supervisors to make the people work. -- 2 chronicles 2:18
.
Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. -- 2 chronicles 3:1
.
He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. -- 2 chronicles 3:2
.
Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for building the house of God. The length in cubits, according to the old standard was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits. -- 2 chronicles 3:3
.
The porch which was in front of the house was as long as the width of the house, twenty cubits, and the height 120; and inside he overlaid it with pure gold. -- 2 chronicles 3:4
.
He overlaid the main room with cypress wood and overlaid it with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. -- 2 chronicles 3:5
.
Further, he adorned the house with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim. -- 2 chronicles 3:6
.
He also overlaid the house with gold--the beams, the thresholds and its walls and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls. -- 2 chronicles 3:7
.
Now he made the room of the holy of holies: its length across the width of the house was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to talents. -- 2 chronicles 3:8
.
The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold. -- 2 chronicles 3:9
.
Then he made two sculptured cherubim in the room of the holy of holies and overlaid them with gold. -- 2 chronicles 3:10
.
The wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits; the wing of one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub. -- 2 chronicles 3:11
.
The wing of the other cherub, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house; and its other wing of five cubits was attached to the wing of the first cherub. -- 2 chronicles 3:12
.
The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet facing the main room. -- 2 chronicles 3:13
.
He made the veil of violet, purple, crimson and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it. -- 2 chronicles 3:14
.
He also made two pillars for the front of the house, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on the top of each was five cubits. -- 2 chronicles 3:15
.
He made chains in the inner sanctuary and placed them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates and placed them on the chains. -- 2 chronicles 3:16
.
He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left, and named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz. -- 2 chronicles 3:17
.
Then he made a bronze altar, twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width and ten cubits in height. -- 2 chronicles 4:1
.
Also he made the cast metal sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits and its circumference thirty cubits. -- 2 chronicles 4:2
.
Now figures like oxen were under it and all around it, ten cubits, entirely encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast in one piece. -- 2 chronicles 4:3
.
It stood on twelve oxen, three facing the north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east; and the sea was set on top of them and all their hindquarters turned inwards. -- 2 chronicles 4:4
.
It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom; it could hold 3,baths. -- 2 chronicles 4:5
.
He also made ten basins in which to wash, and he set five on the right side and five on the left to rinse things for the burnt offering; but the sea was for the priests to wash in. -- 2 chronicles 4:6
.
Then he made the ten golden lampstands in the way prescribed for them and he set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. -- 2 chronicles 4:7
.
He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred golden bowls. -- 2 chronicles 4:8
.
Then he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze. -- 2 chronicles 4:9
.
He set the sea on the right side of the house toward the southeast. -- 2 chronicles 4:10
.
Huram also made the pails, the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of God: -- 2 chronicles 4:11
.
the two pillars, the bowls and the two capitals on top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars, -- 2 chronicles 4:12
.
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the pillars. -- 2 chronicles 4:13
.
He also made the stands and he made the basins on the stands, -- 2 chronicles 4:14
.
and the one sea with the twelve oxen under it. -- 2 chronicles 4:15
.
The pails, the shovels, the forks and all its utensils, Huram-abi made of polished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 4:16
.
On the plain of the Jordan the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. -- 2 chronicles 4:17
.
Thus Solomon made all these utensils in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze could not be found out. -- 2 chronicles 4:18
.
Solomon also made all the things that were in the house of God: even the golden altar, the tables with the bread of the Presence on them, -- 2 chronicles 4:19
.
the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary in the way prescribed; -- 2 chronicles 4:20
.
the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold, of purest gold; -- 2 chronicles 4:21
.
and the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons and the firepans of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the holy of holies and the doors of the house, that is, of the nave, of gold. -- 2 chronicles 4:22
.
Thus all the work that Solomon performed for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver and the gold and all the utensils, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God. -- 2 chronicles 5:1
.
Then Solomon assembled to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' households of the sons of Israel, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. -- 2 chronicles 5:2
.
All the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, that is in the seventh month. -- 2 chronicles 5:3
.
Then all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. -- 2 chronicles 5:4
.
They brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils which were in the tent; the Levitical priests brought them up. -- 2 chronicles 5:5
.
And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. -- 2 chronicles 5:6
.
Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubim. -- 2 chronicles 5:7
.
For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles. -- 2 chronicles 5:8
.
The poles were so long that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; and they are there to this day. -- 2 chronicles 5:9
.
There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. -- 2 chronicles 5:10
.
When the priests came forth from the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to divisions), -- 2 chronicles 5:11
.
and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and kinsmen, clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps and lyres, standing east of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets -- 2 chronicles 5:12
.
in unison when the trumpeters and the singers were to make themselves heard with one voice to praise and to glorify the LORD, and when they lifted up their voice accompanied by trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and when they praised the LORD saying, "He indeed is good for His lovingkindness is everlasting," then the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud, -- 2 chronicles 5:13
.
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God. -- 2 chronicles 5:14
.
Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud. -- 2 chronicles 6:1
.
"I have built You a lofty house, And a place for Your dwelling forever." -- 2 chronicles 6:2
.
Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing. -- 2 chronicles 6:3
.
He said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hands, saying, -- 2 chronicles 6:4
.
'Since the day that I brought My people from the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there, nor did I choose any man for a leader over My people Israel; -- 2 chronicles 6:5
.
but I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.' -- 2 chronicles 6:6
.
"Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 6:7
.
"But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart. -- 2 chronicles 6:8
.
'Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he shall build the house for My name.' -- 2 chronicles 6:9
.
"Now the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; for I have risen in the place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 6:10
.
"There I have set the ark in which is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with the sons of Israel." -- 2 chronicles 6:11
.
Then he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands. -- 2 chronicles 6:12
.
Now Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven. -- 2 chronicles 6:13
.
He said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no god like You in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing lovingkindness to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart; -- 2 chronicles 6:14
.
who has kept with Your servant David, my father, that which You have promised him; indeed You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day. -- 2 chronicles 6:15
.
"Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Your servant David, my father, that which You have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way, to walk in My law as you have walked before Me.' -- 2 chronicles 6:16
.
"Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed which You have spoken to Your servant David. -- 2 chronicles 6:17
.
"But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You; how much less this house which I have built. -- 2 chronicles 6:18
.
"Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant prays before You; -- 2 chronicles 6:19
.
that Your eye may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place of which You have said that You would put Your name there, to listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place. -- 2 chronicles 6:20
.
"Listen to the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place; hear from Your dwelling place, from heaven; hear and forgive. -- 2 chronicles 6:21
.
"If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this house, -- 2 chronicles 6:22
.
then hear from heaven and act and judge Your servants, punishing the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness. -- 2 chronicles 6:23
.
"If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication before You in this house, -- 2 chronicles 6:24
.
then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and to their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 6:25
.
"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin when You afflict them; -- 2 chronicles 6:26
.
then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people for an inheritance. -- 2 chronicles 6:27
.
"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, if there is locust or grasshopper, if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague or whatever sickness there is, -- 2 chronicles 6:28
.
whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all Your people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own pain, and spreading his hands toward this house, -- 2 chronicles 6:29
.
then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men, -- 2 chronicles 6:30
.
that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways as long as they live in the land which You have given to our fathers. -- 2 chronicles 6:31
.
"Also concerning the foreigner who is not from Your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for Your great name's sake and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this house, -- 2 chronicles 6:32
.
then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, and fear You as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name. -- 2 chronicles 6:33
.
"When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name, -- 2 chronicles 6:34
.
then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. -- 2 chronicles 6:35
.
"When they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to a land far off or near, -- 2 chronicles 6:36
.
if they take thought in the land where they are taken captive, and repent and make supplication to You in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned, we have committed iniquity and have acted wickedly'; -- 2 chronicles 6:37
.
if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and pray toward their land which You have given to their fathers and the city which You have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Your name, -- 2 chronicles 6:38
.
then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, their prayer and supplications, and maintain their cause and forgive Your people who have sinned against You. -- 2 chronicles 6:39
.
"Now, O my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place. -- 2 chronicles 6:40
.
"Now therefore arise, O LORD God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your might; let Your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation and let Your godly ones rejoice in what is good. -- 2 chronicles 6:41
.
"O LORD God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember Your lovingkindness to Your servant David." -- 2 chronicles 6:42
.
Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the house. -- 2 chronicles 7:1
.
The priests could not enter into the house of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD'S house. -- 2 chronicles 7:2
.
All the sons of Israel, seeing the fire come down and the glory of the LORD upon the house, bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave praise to the LORD, saying, "Truly He is good, truly His lovingkindness is everlasting." -- 2 chronicles 7:3
.
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 7:4
.
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,oxen and 120,000 sheep. Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. -- 2 chronicles 7:5
.
The priests stood at their posts, and the Levites also, with the instruments of music to the LORD, which King David had made for giving praise to the LORD--"for His lovingkindness is everlasting"--whenever he gave praise by their means, while the priests on the other side blew trumpets; and all Israel was standing. -- 2 chronicles 7:6
.
Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt offering, the grain offering and the fat. -- 2 chronicles 7:7
.
So Solomon observed the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly who came from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt. -- 2 chronicles 7:8
.
On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar they observed seven days and the feast seven days. -- 2 chronicles 7:9
.
Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their tents, rejoicing and happy of heart because of the goodness that the LORD had shown to David and to Solomon and to His people Israel. -- 2 chronicles 7:10
.
Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's palace, and successfully completed all that he had planned on doing in the house of the LORD and in his palace. -- 2 chronicles 7:11
.
Then the LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. -- 2 chronicles 7:12
.
"If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, -- 2 chronicles 7:13
.
and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land. -- 2 chronicles 7:14
.
"Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place. -- 2 chronicles 7:15
.
"For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that My name may be there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. -- 2 chronicles 7:16
.
"As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep My statutes and My ordinances, -- 2 chronicles 7:17
.
then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to be ruler in Israel.' -- 2 chronicles 7:18
.
"But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, -- 2 chronicles 7:19
.
then I will uproot you from My land which I have given you, and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. -- 2 chronicles 7:20
.
"As for this house, which was exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?' -- 2 chronicles 7:21
.
"And they will say, 'Because they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers who brought them from the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them; therefore He has brought all this adversity on them.'" -- 2 chronicles 7:22
.
Now it came about at the end of the twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house -- 2 chronicles 8:1
.
that he built the cities which Huram had given to him, and settled the sons of Israel there. -- 2 chronicles 8:2
.
Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it. -- 2 chronicles 8:3
.
He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities which he had built in Hamath. -- 2 chronicles 8:4
.
He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates and bars; -- 2 chronicles 8:5
.
and Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule. -- 2 chronicles 8:6
.
All of the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel, -- 2 chronicles 8:7
.
namely, from their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel had not destroyed, them Solomon raised as forced laborers to this day. -- 2 chronicles 8:8
.
But Solomon did not make slaves for his work from the sons of Israel; they were men of war, his chief captains and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen. -- 2 chronicles 8:9
.
These were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred and fifty who ruled over the people. -- 2 chronicles 8:10
.
Then Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house which he had built for her, for he said, "My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy where the ark of the LORD has entered." -- 2 chronicles 8:11
.
Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the porch; -- 2 chronicles 8:12
.
and did so according to the daily rule, offering them up according to the commandment of Moses, for the sabbaths, the new moons and the three annual feasts--the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths. -- 2 chronicles 8:13
.
Now according to the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their duties of praise and ministering before the priests according to the daily rule, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate; for David the man of God had so commanded. -- 2 chronicles 8:14
.
And they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites in any manner or concerning the storehouses. -- 2 chronicles 8:15
.
Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed. -- 2 chronicles 8:16
.
Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom. -- 2 chronicles 8:17
.
And Huram by his servants sent him ships and servants who knew the sea; and they went with Solomon's servants to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon. -- 2 chronicles 8:18
.
Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with difficult questions. She had a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and a large amount of gold and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was on her heart. -- 2 chronicles 9:1
.
Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her. -- 2 chronicles 9:2
.
When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house which he had built, -- 2 chronicles 9:3
.
the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, she was breathless. -- 2 chronicles 9:4
.
Then she said to the king, "It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. -- 2 chronicles 9:5
.
"Nevertheless I did not believe their reports until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You surpass the report that I heard. -- 2 chronicles 9:6
.
"How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom. -- 2 chronicles 9:7
.
"Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you, setting you on His throne as king for the LORD your God; because your God loved Israel establishing them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness." -- 2 chronicles 9:8
.
Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great amount of spices and precious stones; there had never been spice like that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. -- 2 chronicles 9:9
.
The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones. -- 2 chronicles 9:10
.
From the algum trees the king made steps for the house of the LORD and for the king's palace, and lyres and harps for the singers; and none like that was seen before in the land of Judah. -- 2 chronicles 9:11
.
King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested besides a return for what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her own land with her servants. -- 2 chronicles 9:12
.
Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was talents of gold, -- 2 chronicles 9:13
.
besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. -- 2 chronicles 9:14
.
King Solomon made large shields of beaten gold, using 600 shekels of beaten gold on each large shield. -- 2 chronicles 9:15
.
He made shields of beaten gold, using three hundred shekels of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. -- 2 chronicles 9:16
.
Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. -- 2 chronicles 9:17
.
There were six steps to the throne and a footstool in gold attached to the throne, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. -- 2 chronicles 9:18
.
Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom. -- 2 chronicles 9:19
.
All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. -- 2 chronicles 9:20
.
For the king had ships which went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks. -- 2 chronicles 9:21
.
So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. -- 2 chronicles 9:22
.
And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. -- 2 chronicles 9:23
.
They brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses and mules, so much year by year. -- 2 chronicles 9:24
.
Now Solomon had 4,stalls for horses and chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 9:25
.
He was the ruler over all the kings from the Euphrates River even to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt. -- 2 chronicles 9:26
.
The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland. -- 2 chronicles 9:27
.
And they were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries. -- 2 chronicles 9:28
.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? -- 2 chronicles 9:29
.
Solomon reigned forty years in Jerusalem over all Israel. -- 2 chronicles 9:30
.
And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place. -- 2 chronicles 9:31
.
Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. -- 2 chronicles 10:1
.
When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), Jeroboam returned from Egypt. -- 2 chronicles 10:2
.
So they sent and summoned him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, -- 2 chronicles 10:3
.
"Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you." -- 2 chronicles 10:4
.
He said to them, "Return to me again in three days." So the people departed. -- 2 chronicles 10:5
.
Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, "How do you counsel me to answer this people?" -- 2 chronicles 10:6
.
They spoke to him, saying, "If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever." -- 2 chronicles 10:7
.
But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him. -- 2 chronicles 10:8
.
So he said to them, "What counsel do you give that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, 'Lighten the yoke which your father put on us'?" -- 2 chronicles 10:9
.
The young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus you shall say to the people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter for us.' Thus you shall say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins! -- 2 chronicles 10:10
.
'Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'" -- 2 chronicles 10:11
.
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, "Return to me on the third day." -- 2 chronicles 10:12
.
The king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders. -- 2 chronicles 10:13
.
He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions." -- 2 chronicles 10:14
.
So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of events from God that the LORD might establish His word, which He spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. -- 2 chronicles 10:15
.
When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them the people answered the king, saying, "What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel; Now look after your own house, David." So all Israel departed to their tents. -- 2 chronicles 10:16
.
But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. -- 2 chronicles 10:17
.
Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, and the sons of Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 10:18
.
So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. -- 2 chronicles 10:19
.
Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. -- 2 chronicles 11:1
.
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, -- 2 chronicles 11:2
.
"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, -- 2 chronicles 11:3
.
'Thus says the LORD, "You shall not go up or fight against your relatives; return every man to his house, for this thing is from Me."'" So they listened to the words of the LORD and returned from going against Jeroboam. -- 2 chronicles 11:4
.
Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built cities for defense in Judah. -- 2 chronicles 11:5
.
Thus he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, -- 2 chronicles 11:6
.
Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, -- 2 chronicles 11:7
.
Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, -- 2 chronicles 11:8
.
Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, -- 2 chronicles 11:9
.
Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. -- 2 chronicles 11:10
.
He also strengthened the fortresses and put officers in them and stores of food, oil and wine. -- 2 chronicles 11:11
.
He put shields and spears in every city and strengthened them greatly. So he held Judah and Benjamin. -- 2 chronicles 11:12
.
Moreover, the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him from all their districts. -- 2 chronicles 11:13
.
For the Levites left their pasture lands and their property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 11:14
.
He set up priests of his own for the high places, for the satyrs and for the calves which he had made. -- 2 chronicles 11:15
.
Those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 11:16
.
They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years. -- 2 chronicles 11:17
.
Then Rehoboam took as a wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse, -- 2 chronicles 11:18
.
and she bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham. -- 2 chronicles 11:19
.
After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. -- 2 chronicles 11:20
.
Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his other wives and concubines. For he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. -- 2 chronicles 11:21
.
Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as head and leader among his brothers, for he intended to make him king. -- 2 chronicles 11:22
.
He acted wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the territories of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities, and he gave them food in abundance. And he sought many wives for them. -- 2 chronicles 11:23
.
When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and strong, he and all Israel with him forsook the law of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 12:1
.
And it came about in King Rehoboam's fifth year, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem -- 2 chronicles 12:2
.
with 1,chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people who came with him from Egypt were without number: the Lubim, the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians. -- 2 chronicles 12:3
.
He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 12:4
.
Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, 'You have forsaken Me, so I also have forsaken you to Shishak.'" -- 2 chronicles 12:5
.
So the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is righteous." -- 2 chronicles 12:6
.
When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, "They have humbled themselves so I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some measure of deliverance, and My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by means of Shishak. -- 2 chronicles 12:7
.
"But they will become his slaves so that they may learn the difference between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries." -- 2 chronicles 12:8
.
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's palace. He took everything; he even took the golden shields which Solomon had made. -- 2 chronicles 12:9
.
Then King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the door of the king's house. -- 2 chronicles 12:10
.
As often as the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards came and carried them and then brought them back into the guards' room. -- 2 chronicles 12:11
.
And when he humbled himself, the anger of the LORD turned away from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and also conditions were good in Judah. -- 2 chronicles 12:12
.
So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. -- 2 chronicles 12:13
.
He did evil because he did not set his heart to seek the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 12:14
.
Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, according to genealogical enrollment? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. -- 2 chronicles 12:15
.
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David; and his son Abijah became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 12:16
.
In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. -- 2 chronicles 13:1
.
He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. -- 2 chronicles 13:2
.
Abijah began the battle with an army of valiant warriors, 400,chosen men, while Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 chosen men who were valiant warriors. -- 2 chronicles 13:3
.
Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel: -- 2 chronicles 13:4
.
"Do you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the rule over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt? -- 2 chronicles 13:5
.
"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master, -- 2 chronicles 13:6
.
and worthless men gathered about him, scoundrels, who proved too strong for Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when he was young and timid and could not hold his own against them. -- 2 chronicles 13:7
.
"So now you intend to resist the kingdom of the LORD through the sons of David, being a great multitude and having with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made for gods for you. -- 2 chronicles 13:8
.
"Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, even he may become a priest of what are no gods. -- 2 chronicles 13:9
.
"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the sons of Aaron are ministering to the LORD as priests, and the Levites attend to their work. -- 2 chronicles 13:10
.
"Every morning and evening they burn to the LORD burnt offerings and fragrant incense, and the showbread is set on the clean table, and the golden lampstand with its lamps is ready to light every evening; for we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken Him. -- 2 chronicles 13:11
.
"Now behold, God is with us at our head and His priests with the signal trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers, for you will not succeed." -- 2 chronicles 13:12
.
But Jeroboam had set an ambush to come from the rear, so that Israel was in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them. -- 2 chronicles 13:13
.
When Judah turned around, behold, they were attacked both front and rear; so they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets. -- 2 chronicles 13:14
.
Then the men of Judah raised a war cry, and when the men of Judah raised the war cry, then it was that God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. -- 2 chronicles 13:15
.
When the sons of Israel fled before Judah, God gave them into their hand. -- 2 chronicles 13:16
.
Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,chosen men of Israel fell slain. -- 2 chronicles 13:17
.
Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time, and the sons of Judah conquered because they trusted in the LORD, the God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 13:18
.
Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured from him several cities, Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages. -- 2 chronicles 13:19
.
Jeroboam did not again recover strength in the days of Abijah; and the LORD struck him and he died. -- 2 chronicles 13:20
.
But Abijah became powerful; and took fourteen wives to himself, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. -- 2 chronicles 13:21
.
Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his words are written in the treatise of the prophet Iddo. -- 2 chronicles 13:22
.
So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and his son Asa became king in his place. The land was undisturbed for ten years during his days. -- 2 chronicles 14:1
.
Asa did good and right in the sight of the LORD his God, -- 2 chronicles 14:2
.
for he removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherim, -- 2 chronicles 14:3
.
and commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers and to observe the law and the commandment. -- 2 chronicles 14:4
.
He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. And the kingdom was undisturbed under him. -- 2 chronicles 14:5
.
He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land was undisturbed, and there was no one at war with him during those years, because the LORD had given him rest. -- 2 chronicles 14:6
.
For he said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered. -- 2 chronicles 14:7
.
Now Asa had an army of 300,from Judah, bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin, bearing shields and wielding bows; all of them were valiant warriors. -- 2 chronicles 14:8
.
Now Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and chariots, and he came to Mareshah. -- 2 chronicles 14:9
.
So Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. -- 2 chronicles 14:10
.
Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, "LORD, there is no one besides You to help in the battle between the powerful and those who have no strength; so help us, O LORD our God, for we trust in You, and in Your name have come against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God; let not man prevail against You." -- 2 chronicles 14:11
.
So the LORD routed the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled. -- 2 chronicles 14:12
.
Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar; and so many Ethiopians fell that they could not recover, for they were shattered before the LORD and before His army. And they carried away very much plunder. -- 2 chronicles 14:13
.
They destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of the LORD had fallen on them; and they despoiled all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. -- 2 chronicles 14:14
.
They also struck down those who owned livestock, and they carried away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 14:15
.
Now the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded, -- 2 chronicles 15:1
.
and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Listen to me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: the LORD is with you when you are with Him. And if you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you. -- 2 chronicles 15:2
.
"For many days Israel was without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law. -- 2 chronicles 15:3
.
"But in their distress they turned to the LORD God of Israel, and they sought Him, and He let them find Him. -- 2 chronicles 15:4
.
"In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for many disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. -- 2 chronicles 15:5
.
"Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress. -- 2 chronicles 15:6
.
"But you, be strong and do not lose courage, for there is reward for your work." -- 2 chronicles 15:7
.
Now when Asa heard these words and the prophecy which Azariah the son of Oded the prophet spoke, he took courage and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the LORD which was in front of the porch of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 15:8
.
He gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who resided with them, for many defected to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. -- 2 chronicles 15:9
.
So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign. -- 2 chronicles 15:10
.
They sacrificed to the LORD that day oxen and 7,000 sheep from the spoil they had brought. -- 2 chronicles 15:11
.
They entered into the covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and soul; -- 2 chronicles 15:12
.
and whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman. -- 2 chronicles 15:13
.
Moreover, they made an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets and with horns. -- 2 chronicles 15:14
.
All Judah rejoiced concerning the oath, for they had sworn with their whole heart and had sought Him earnestly, and He let them find Him. So the LORD gave them rest on every side. -- 2 chronicles 15:15
.
He also removed Maacah, the mother of King Asa, from the position of queen mother, because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah, and Asa cut down her horrid image, crushed it and burned it at the brook Kidron. -- 2 chronicles 15:16
.
But the high places were not removed from Israel; nevertheless Asa's heart was blameless all his days. -- 2 chronicles 15:17
.
He brought into the house of God the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things: silver and gold and utensils. -- 2 chronicles 15:18
.
And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign. -- 2 chronicles 15:19
.
In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah. -- 2 chronicles 16:1
.
Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the king's house, and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying, -- 2 chronicles 16:2
.
"Let there be a treaty between you and me, as between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me." -- 2 chronicles 16:3
.
So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim and all the store cities of Naphtali. -- 2 chronicles 16:4
.
When Baasha heard of it, he ceased fortifying Ramah and stopped his work. -- 2 chronicles 16:5
.
Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and with them he fortified Geba and Mizpah. -- 2 chronicles 16:6
.
At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, "Because you have relied on the king of Aram and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Aram has escaped out of your hand. -- 2 chronicles 16:7
.
"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim an immense army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand. -- 2 chronicles 16:8
.
"For the eyes of the LORD move to and fro throughout the earth that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His. You have acted foolishly in this. Indeed, from now on you will surely have wars." -- 2 chronicles 16:9
.
Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him for this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time. -- 2 chronicles 16:10
.
Now, the acts of Asa from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. -- 2 chronicles 16:11
.
In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa became diseased in his feet. His disease was severe, yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but the physicians. -- 2 chronicles 16:12
.
So Asa slept with his fathers, having died in the forty-first year of his reign. -- 2 chronicles 16:13
.
They buried him in his own tomb which he had cut out for himself in the city of David, and they laid him in the resting place which he had filled with spices of various kinds blended by the perfumers' art; and they made a very great fire for him. -- 2 chronicles 16:14
.
Jehoshaphat his son then became king in his place, and made his position over Israel firm. -- 2 chronicles 17:1
.
He placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had captured. -- 2 chronicles 17:2
.
The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father David's earlier days and did not seek the Baals, -- 2 chronicles 17:3
.
but sought the God of his father, followed His commandments, and did not act as Israel did. -- 2 chronicles 17:4
.
So the LORD established the kingdom in his control, and all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor. -- 2 chronicles 17:5
.
He took great pride in the ways of the LORD and again removed the high places and the Asherim from Judah. -- 2 chronicles 17:6
.
Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; -- 2 chronicles 17:7
.
and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. -- 2 chronicles 17:8
.
They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the LORD with them; and they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people. -- 2 chronicles 17:9
.
Now the dread of the LORD was on all the kingdoms of the lands which were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. -- 2 chronicles 17:10
.
Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat; the Arabians also brought him flocks, 7,rams and 7,700 male goats. -- 2 chronicles 17:11
.
So Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah. -- 2 chronicles 17:12
.
He had large supplies in the cities of Judah, and warriors, valiant men, in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 17:13
.
This was their muster according to their fathers' households: of Judah, commanders of thousands, Adnah was the commander, and with him 300,valiant warriors; -- 2 chronicles 17:14
.
and next to him was Johanan the commander, and with him 280,000; -- 2 chronicles 17:15
.
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered for the LORD, and with him 200,valiant warriors; -- 2 chronicles 17:16
.
and of Benjamin, Eliada a valiant warrior, and with him 200,armed with bow and shield; -- 2 chronicles 17:17
.
and next to him Jehozabad, and with him 180,equipped for war. -- 2 chronicles 17:18
.
These are they who served the king, apart from those whom the king put in the fortified cities through all Judah. -- 2 chronicles 17:19
.
Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he allied himself by marriage with Ahab. -- 2 chronicles 18:1
.
Some years later he went down to visit Ahab at Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. -- 2 chronicles 18:2
.
Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?" And he said to him, "I am as you are, and my people as your people, and we will be with you in the battle." -- 2 chronicles 18:3
.
Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire first for the word of the LORD." -- 2 chronicles 18:4
.
Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?" And they said, "Go up, for God will give it into the hand of the king." -- 2 chronicles 18:5
.
But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not yet a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of him?" -- 2 chronicles 18:6
.
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me but always evil. He is Micaiah, son of Imla." But Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king say so." -- 2 chronicles 18:7
.
Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah, Imla's son." -- 2 chronicles 18:8
.
Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. -- 2 chronicles 18:9
.
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are consumed.'" -- 2 chronicles 18:10
.
All the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king." -- 2 chronicles 18:11
.
Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, "Behold, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them and speak favorably." -- 2 chronicles 18:12
.
But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak." -- 2 chronicles 18:13
.
When he came to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?" He said, "Go up and succeed, for they will be given into your hand." -- 2 chronicles 18:14
.
Then the king said to him, "How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?" -- 2 chronicles 18:15
.
So he said, "I saw all Israel Scattered on the mountains, Like sheep which have no shepherd; And the LORD said, 'These have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.'" -- 2 chronicles 18:16
.
Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?" -- 2 chronicles 18:17
.
Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left. -- 2 chronicles 18:18
.
"The LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said this while another said that. -- 2 chronicles 18:19
.
"Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.' And the LORD said to him, 'How?' -- 2 chronicles 18:20
.
"He said, 'I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Then He said, 'You are to entice him and prevail also. Go and do so.' -- 2 chronicles 18:21
.
"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, for the LORD has proclaimed disaster against you." -- 2 chronicles 18:22
.
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?" -- 2 chronicles 18:23
.
Micaiah said, "Behold, you will see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself." -- 2 chronicles 18:24
.
Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son; -- 2 chronicles 18:25
.
and say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely."'" -- 2 chronicles 18:26
.
Micaiah said, "If you indeed return safely, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Listen, all you people." -- 2 chronicles 18:27
.
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead. -- 2 chronicles 18:28
.
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle. -- 2 chronicles 18:29
.
Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone." -- 2 chronicles 18:30
.
So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "It is the king of Israel," and they turned aside to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him, and God diverted them from him. -- 2 chronicles 18:31
.
When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. -- 2 chronicles 18:32
.
A certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of the chariot, "Turn around and take me out of the fight, for I am severely wounded." -- 2 chronicles 18:33
.
The battle raged that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans until the evening; and at sunset he died. -- 2 chronicles 18:34
.
Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 19:1
.
Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD and so bring wrath on yourself from the LORD? -- 2 chronicles 19:2
.
"But there is some good in you, for you have removed the Asheroth from the land and you have set your heart to seek God." -- 2 chronicles 19:3
.
So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 19:4
.
He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. -- 2 chronicles 19:5
.
He said to the judges, "Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the LORD who is with you when you render judgment. -- 2 chronicles 19:6
.
"Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be very careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in unrighteousness or partiality or the taking of a bribe." -- 2 chronicles 19:7
.
In Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the heads of the fathers' households of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD and to judge disputes among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 19:8
.
Then he charged them saying, "Thus you shall do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and wholeheartedly. -- 2 chronicles 19:9
.
"Whenever any dispute comes to you from your brethren who live in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you shall warn them so that they may not be guilty before the LORD, and wrath may not come on you and your brethren. Thus you shall do and you will not be guilty. -- 2 chronicles 19:10
.
"Behold, Amariah the chief priest will be over you in all that pertains to the LORD, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king. Also the Levites shall be officers before you. Act resolutely, and the LORD be with the upright." -- 2 chronicles 19:11
.
Now it came about after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat. -- 2 chronicles 20:1
.
Then some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, "A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, out of Aram and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (that is Engedi)." -- 2 chronicles 20:2
.
Jehoshaphat was afraid and turned his attention to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. -- 2 chronicles 20:3
.
So Judah gathered together to seek help from the LORD; they even came from all the cities of Judah to seek the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 20:4
.
Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD before the new court, -- 2 chronicles 20:5
.
and he said, "O LORD, the God of our fathers, are You not God in the heavens? And are You not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand so that no one can stand against You. -- 2 chronicles 20:6
.
"Did You not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever? -- 2 chronicles 20:7
.
"They have lived in it, and have built You a sanctuary there for Your name, saying, -- 2 chronicles 20:8
.
'Should evil come upon us, the sword, or judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before You (for Your name is in this house) and cry to You in our distress, and You will hear and deliver us.' -- 2 chronicles 20:9
.
"Now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt (they turned aside from them and did not destroy them), -- 2 chronicles 20:10
.
see how they are rewarding us by coming to drive us out from Your possession which You have given us as an inheritance. -- 2 chronicles 20:11
.
"O our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless before this great multitude who are coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are on You." -- 2 chronicles 20:12
.
All Judah was standing before the LORD, with their infants, their wives and their children. -- 2 chronicles 20:13
.
Then in the midst of the assembly the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite of the sons of Asaph; -- 2 chronicles 20:14
.
and he said, "Listen, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: thus says the LORD to you, 'Do not fear or be dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours but God's. -- 2 chronicles 20:15
.
'Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel. -- 2 chronicles 20:16
.
'You need not fight in this battle; station yourselves, stand and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.' Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out to face them, for the LORD is with you." -- 2 chronicles 20:17
.
Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshiping the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 20:18
.
The Levites, from the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel, with a very loud voice. -- 2 chronicles 20:19
.
They rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa; and when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, put your trust in the LORD your God and you will be established. Put your trust in His prophets and succeed." -- 2 chronicles 20:20
.
When he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who sang to the LORD and those who praised Him in holy attire, as they went out before the army and said, "Give thanks to the LORD, for His lovingkindness is everlasting." -- 2 chronicles 20:21
.
When they began singing and praising, the LORD set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; so they were routed. -- 2 chronicles 20:22
.
For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir destroying them completely; and when they had finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another. -- 2 chronicles 20:23
.
When Judah came to the lookout of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and behold, they were corpses lying on the ground, and no one had escaped. -- 2 chronicles 20:24
.
When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found much among them, including goods, garments and valuable things which they took for themselves, more than they could carry. And they were three days taking the spoil because there was so much. -- 2 chronicles 20:25
.
Then on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Beracah, for there they blessed the LORD. Therefore they have named that place "The Valley of Beracah" until today. -- 2 chronicles 20:26
.
Every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned with Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. -- 2 chronicles 20:27
.
They came to Jerusalem with harps, lyres and trumpets to the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 20:28
.
And the dread of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 20:29
.
So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God gave him rest on all sides. -- 2 chronicles 20:30
.
Now Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. -- 2 chronicles 20:31
.
He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not depart from it, doing right in the sight of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 20:32
.
The high places, however, were not removed; the people had not yet directed their hearts to the God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 20:33
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first to last, behold, they are written in the annals of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 20:34
.
After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. He acted wickedly in so doing. -- 2 chronicles 20:35
.
So he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber. -- 2 chronicles 20:36
.
Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying, "Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works." So the ships were broken and could not go to Tarshish. -- 2 chronicles 20:37
.
Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 21:1
.
He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 21:2
.
Their father gave them many gifts of silver, gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. -- 2 chronicles 21:3
.
Now when Jehoram had taken over the kingdom of his father and made himself secure, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and some of the rulers of Israel also. -- 2 chronicles 21:4
.
Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 21:5
.
He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did (for Ahab's daughter was his wife), and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 21:6
.
Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David because of the covenant which He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and his sons forever. -- 2 chronicles 21:7
.
In his days Edom revolted against the rule of Judah and set up a king over themselves. -- 2 chronicles 21:8
.
Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots with him. And he arose by night and struck down the Edomites who were surrounding him and the commanders of the chariots. -- 2 chronicles 21:9
.
So Edom revolted against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time against his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. -- 2 chronicles 21:10
.
Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot and led Judah astray. -- 2 chronicles 21:11
.
Then a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet saying, "Thus says the LORD God of your father David, 'Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and the ways of Asa king of Judah, -- 2 chronicles 21:12
.
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot as the house of Ahab played the harlot, and you have also killed your brothers, your own family, who were better than you, -- 2 chronicles 21:13
.
behold, the LORD is going to strike your people, your sons, your wives and all your possessions with a great calamity; -- 2 chronicles 21:14
.
and you will suffer severe sickness, a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the sickness, day by day.'" -- 2 chronicles 21:15
.
Then the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who bordered the Ethiopians; -- 2 chronicles 21:16
.
and they came against Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions found in the king's house together with his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. -- 2 chronicles 21:17
.
So after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable sickness. -- 2 chronicles 21:18
.
Now it came about in the course of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels came out because of his sickness and he died in great pain. And his people made no fire for him like the fire for his fathers. -- 2 chronicles 21:19
.
He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years; and he departed with no one's regret, and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. -- 2 chronicles 21:20
.
Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabs to the camp had slain all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. -- 2 chronicles 22:1
.
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri. -- 2 chronicles 22:2
.
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly. -- 2 chronicles 22:3
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction. -- 2 chronicles 22:4
.
He also walked according to their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram. -- 2 chronicles 22:5
.
So he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. -- 2 chronicles 22:6
.
Now the destruction of Ahaziah was from God, in that he went to Joram. For when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. -- 2 chronicles 22:7
.
It came about when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them. -- 2 chronicles 22:8
.
He also sought Ahaziah, and they caught him while he was hiding in Samaria; they brought him to Jehu, put him to death and buried him. For they said, "He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." So there was no one of the house of Ahaziah to retain the power of the kingdom. -- 2 chronicles 22:9
.
Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah. -- 2 chronicles 22:10
.
But Jehoshabeath the king's daughter took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she would not put him to death. -- 2 chronicles 22:11
.
He was hidden with them in the house of God six years while Athaliah reigned over the land. -- 2 chronicles 22:12
.
Now in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Johanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, and they entered into a covenant with him. -- 2 chronicles 23:1
.
They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers' households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 23:2
.
Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them, "Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD has spoken concerning the sons of David. -- 2 chronicles 23:3
.
"This is the thing which you shall do: one third of you, of the priests and Levites who come in on the sabbath, shall be gatekeepers, -- 2 chronicles 23:4
.
and one third shall be at the king's house, and a third at the Gate of the Foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 23:5
.
"But let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and the ministering Levites; they may enter, for they are holy. And let all the people keep the charge of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 23:6
.
"The Levites will surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever enters the house, let him be killed. Thus be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out." -- 2 chronicles 23:7
.
So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss any of the divisions. -- 2 chronicles 23:8
.
Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had been King David's, which were in the house of God. -- 2 chronicles 23:9
.
He stationed all the people, each man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king. -- 2 chronicles 23:10
.
Then they brought out the king's son and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, "Long live the king!" -- 2 chronicles 23:11
.
When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came into the house of the LORD to the people. -- 2 chronicles 23:12
.
She looked, and behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters were beside the king. And all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets, the singers with their musical instruments leading the praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said, "Treason! Treason!" -- 2 chronicles 23:13
.
Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, put to death with the sword." For the priest said, "Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD." -- 2 chronicles 23:14
.
So they seized her, and when she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king's house, they put her to death there. -- 2 chronicles 23:15
.
Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they would be the LORD'S people. -- 2 chronicles 23:16
.
And all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down, and they broke in pieces his altars and his images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. -- 2 chronicles 23:17
.
Moreover, Jehoiada placed the offices of the house of the LORD under the authority of the Levitical priests, whom David had assigned over the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses--with rejoicing and singing according to the order of David. -- 2 chronicles 23:18
.
He stationed the gatekeepers of the house of the LORD, so that no one would enter who was in any way unclean. -- 2 chronicles 23:19
.
He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and came through the upper gate to the king's house. And they placed the king upon the royal throne. -- 2 chronicles 23:20
.
So all of the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword. -- 2 chronicles 23:21
.
Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zibiah from Beersheba. -- 2 chronicles 24:1
.
Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. -- 2 chronicles 24:2
.
Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters. -- 2 chronicles 24:3
.
Now it came about after this that Joash decided to restore the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 24:4
.
He gathered the priests and Levites and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God annually, and you shall do the matter quickly." But the Levites did not act quickly. -- 2 chronicles 24:5
.
So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, "Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the levy fixed by Moses the servant of the LORD on the congregation of Israel for the tent of the testimony?" -- 2 chronicles 24:6
.
For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and even used the holy things of the house of the LORD for the Baals. -- 2 chronicles 24:7
.
So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside by the gate of the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 24:8
.
They made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the levy fixed by Moses the servant of God on Israel in the wilderness. -- 2 chronicles 24:9
.
All the officers and all the people rejoiced and brought in their levies and dropped them into the chest until they had finished. -- 2 chronicles 24:10
.
It came about whenever the chest was brought in to the king's officer by the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, then the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer would come, empty the chest, take it, and return it to its place. Thus they did daily and collected much money. -- 2 chronicles 24:11
.
The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 24:12
.
So the workmen labored, and the repair work progressed in their hands, and they restored the house of God according to its specifications and strengthened it. -- 2 chronicles 24:13
.
When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; and it was made into utensils for the house of the LORD, utensils for the service and the burnt offering, and pans and utensils of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada. -- 2 chronicles 24:14
.
Now when Jehoiada reached a ripe old age he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death. -- 2 chronicles 24:15
.
They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done well in Israel and to God and His house. -- 2 chronicles 24:16
.
But after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them. -- 2 chronicles 24:17
.
They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt. -- 2 chronicles 24:18
.
Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them back to the LORD; though they testified against them, they would not listen. -- 2 chronicles 24:19
.
Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people and said to them, "Thus God has said, 'Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD and do not prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He has also forsaken you.'" -- 2 chronicles 24:20
.
So they conspired against him and at the command of the king they stoned him to death in the court of the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 24:21
.
Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which his father Jehoiada had shown him, but he murdered his son. And as he died he said, "May the LORD see and avenge!" -- 2 chronicles 24:22
.
Now it happened at the turn of the year that the army of the Arameans came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed all the officials of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. -- 2 chronicles 24:23
.
Indeed the army of the Arameans came with a small number of men; yet the LORD delivered a very great army into their hands, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment on Joash. -- 2 chronicles 24:24
.
When they had departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and murdered him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings. -- 2 chronicles 24:25
.
Now these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. -- 2 chronicles 24:26
.
As to his sons and the many oracles against him and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the treatise of the Book of the Kings. Then Amaziah his son became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 24:27
.
Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 25:1
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD, yet not with a whole heart. -- 2 chronicles 25:2
.
Now it came about as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, that he killed his servants who had slain his father the king. -- 2 chronicles 25:3
.
However, he did not put their children to death, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, which the LORD commanded, saying, "Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, nor sons be put to death for fathers, but each shall be put to death for his own sin." -- 2 chronicles 25:4
.
Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah and appointed them according to their fathers' households under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin; and he took a census of those from twenty years old and upward and found them to be 300,choice men, able to go to war and handle spear and shield. -- 2 chronicles 25:5
.
He hired also 100,valiant warriors out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver. -- 2 chronicles 25:6
.
But a man of God came to him saying, "O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel nor with any of the sons of Ephraim. -- 2 chronicles 25:7
.
"But if you do go, do it, be strong for the battle; yet God will bring you down before the enemy, for God has power to help and to bring down." -- 2 chronicles 25:8
.
Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?" And the man of God answered, "The LORD has much more to give you than this." -- 2 chronicles 25:9
.
Then Amaziah dismissed them, the troops which came to him from Ephraim, to go home; so their anger burned against Judah and they returned home in fierce anger. -- 2 chronicles 25:10
.
Now Amaziah strengthened himself and led his people forth, and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,of the sons of Seir. -- 2 chronicles 25:11
.
The sons of Judah also captured 10,alive and brought them to the top of the cliff and threw them down from the top of the cliff, so that they were all dashed to pieces. -- 2 chronicles 25:12
.
But the troops whom Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,of them and plundered much spoil. -- 2 chronicles 25:13
.
Now after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down before them and burned incense to them. -- 2 chronicles 25:14
.
Then the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, "Why have you sought the gods of the people who have not delivered their own people from your hand?" -- 2 chronicles 25:15
.
As he was talking with him, the king said to him, "Have we appointed you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?" Then the prophet stopped and said, "I know that God has planned to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel." -- 2 chronicles 25:16
.
Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us face each other." -- 2 chronicles 25:17
.
Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trampled the thorn bush. -- 2 chronicles 25:18
.
"You said, 'Behold, you have defeated Edom.' And your heart has become proud in boasting. Now stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, would fall and Judah with you?" -- 2 chronicles 25:19
.
But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, that He might deliver them into the hand of Joash because they had sought the gods of Edom. -- 2 chronicles 25:20
.
So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah. -- 2 chronicles 25:21
.
Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent. -- 2 chronicles 25:22
.
Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, cubits. -- 2 chronicles 25:23
.
He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. -- 2 chronicles 25:24
.
And Amaziah, the son of Joash king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 25:25
.
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? -- 2 chronicles 25:26
.
From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. -- 2 chronicles 25:27
.
Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah. -- 2 chronicles 25:28
.
And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. -- 2 chronicles 26:1
.
He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers. -- 2 chronicles 26:2
.
Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 26:3
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father Amaziah had done. -- 2 chronicles 26:4
.
He continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding through the vision of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God prospered him. -- 2 chronicles 26:5
.
Now he went out and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the area of Ashdod and among the Philistines. -- 2 chronicles 26:6
.
God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur-baal, and the Meunites. -- 2 chronicles 26:7
.
The Ammonites also gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame extended to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong. -- 2 chronicles 26:8
.
Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the corner buttress and fortified them. -- 2 chronicles 26:9
.
He built towers in the wilderness and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the lowland and in the plain. He also had plowmen and vinedressers in the hill country and the fertile fields, for he loved the soil. -- 2 chronicles 26:10
.
Moreover, Uzziah had an army ready for battle, which entered combat by divisions according to the number of their muster, prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's officers. -- 2 chronicles 26:11
.
The total number of the heads of the households, of valiant warriors, was 2,600. -- 2 chronicles 26:12
.
Under their direction was an elite army of 307,500, who could wage war with great power, to help the king against the enemy. -- 2 chronicles 26:13
.
Moreover, Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows and sling stones. -- 2 chronicles 26:14
.
In Jerusalem he made engines of war invented by skillful men to be on the towers and on the corners for the purpose of shooting arrows and great stones. Hence his fame spread afar, for he was marvelously helped until he was strong. -- 2 chronicles 26:15
.
But when he became strong, his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly, and he was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. -- 2 chronicles 26:16
.
Then Azariah the priest entered after him and with him eighty priests of the LORD, valiant men. -- 2 chronicles 26:17
.
They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful and will have no honor from the LORD God." -- 2 chronicles 26:18
.
But Uzziah, with a censer in his hand for burning incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the altar of incense. -- 2 chronicles 26:19
.
Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous on his forehead; and they hurried him out of there, and he himself also hastened to get out because the LORD had smitten him. -- 2 chronicles 26:20
.
King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death; and he lived in a separate house, being a leper, for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king's house judging the people of the land. -- 2 chronicles 26:21
.
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first to last, the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, has written. -- 2 chronicles 26:22
.
So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the grave which belonged to the kings, for they said, "He is a leper." And Jotham his son became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 26:23
.
Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. -- 2 chronicles 27:1
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; however he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people continued acting corruptly. -- 2 chronicles 27:2
.
He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and he built extensively the wall of Ophel. -- 2 chronicles 27:3
.
Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded hills. -- 2 chronicles 27:4
.
He fought also with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them so that the Ammonites gave him during that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites also paid him this amount in the second and in the third year. -- 2 chronicles 27:5
.
So Jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God. -- 2 chronicles 27:6
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, even all his wars and his acts, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. -- 2 chronicles 27:7
.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 27:8
.
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 27:9
.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do right in the sight of the LORD as David his father had done. -- 2 chronicles 28:1
.
But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he also made molten images for the Baals. -- 2 chronicles 28:2
.
Moreover, he burned incense in the valley of Ben-hinnom and burned his sons in fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 28:3
.
He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills and under every green tree. -- 2 chronicles 28:4
.
Wherefore, the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Aram; and they defeated him and carried away from him a great number of captives and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who inflicted him with heavy casualties. -- 2 chronicles 28:5
.
For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah 120,in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 28:6
.
And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son and Azrikam the ruler of the house and Elkanah the second to the king. -- 2 chronicles 28:7
.
The sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren 200,women, sons and daughters; and they took also a great deal of spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. -- 2 chronicles 28:8
.
But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army which came to Samaria and said to them, "Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has even reached heaven. -- 2 chronicles 28:9
.
"Now you are proposing to subjugate for yourselves the people of Judah and Jerusalem for male and female slaves. Surely, do you not have transgressions of your own against the LORD your God? -- 2 chronicles 28:10
.
"Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives whom you captured from your brothers, for the burning anger of the LORD is against you." -- 2 chronicles 28:11
.
Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim--Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai--arose against those who were coming from the battle, -- 2 chronicles 28:12
.
and said to them, "You must not bring the captives in here, for you are proposing to bring upon us guilt against the LORD adding to our sins and our guilt; for our guilt is great so that His burning anger is against Israel." -- 2 chronicles 28:13
.
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the officers and all the assembly. -- 2 chronicles 28:14
.
Then the men who were designated by name arose, took the captives, and they clothed all their naked ones from the spoil; and they gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them drink, anointed them with oil, led all their feeble ones on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers; then they returned to Samaria. -- 2 chronicles 28:15
.
At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help. -- 2 chronicles 28:16
.
For again the Edomites had come and attacked Judah and carried away captives. -- 2 chronicles 28:17
.
The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there. -- 2 chronicles 28:18
.
For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was very unfaithful to the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 28:19
.
So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him. -- 2 chronicles 28:20
.
Although Ahaz took a portion out of the house of the LORD and out of the palace of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria, it did not help him. -- 2 chronicles 28:21
.
Now in the time of his distress this same King Ahaz became yet more unfaithful to the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 28:22
.
For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, and said, "Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me." But they became the downfall of him and all Israel. -- 2 chronicles 28:23
.
Moreover, when Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, he cut the utensils of the house of God in pieces; and he closed the doors of the house of the LORD and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 28:24
.
In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger. -- 2 chronicles 28:25
.
Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. -- 2 chronicles 28:26
.
So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place. -- 2 chronicles 28:27
.
Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. -- 2 chronicles 29:1
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done. -- 2 chronicles 29:2
.
In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them. -- 2 chronicles 29:3
.
He brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them into the square on the east. -- 2 chronicles 29:4
.
Then he said to them, "Listen to me, O Levites. Consecrate yourselves now, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry the uncleanness out from the holy place. -- 2 chronicles 29:5
.
"For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the LORD our God, and have forsaken Him and turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and have turned their backs. -- 2 chronicles 29:6
.
"They have also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 29:7
.
"Therefore the wrath of the LORD was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes. -- 2 chronicles 29:8
.
"For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. -- 2 chronicles 29:9
.
"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that His burning anger may turn away from us. -- 2 chronicles 29:10
.
"My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister to Him, and to be His ministers and burn incense." -- 2 chronicles 29:11
.
Then the Levites arose: Mahath, the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites; and from the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and from the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah; -- 2 chronicles 29:12
.
and from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; -- 2 chronicles 29:13
.
and from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. -- 2 chronicles 29:14
.
They assembled their brothers, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the house of the LORD, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 29:15
.
So the priests went in to the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and every unclean thing which they found in the temple of the LORD they brought out to the court of the house of the LORD. Then the Levites received it to carry out to the Kidron valley. -- 2 chronicles 29:16
.
Now they began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they entered the porch of the LORD. Then they consecrated the house of the LORD in eight days, and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month. -- 2 chronicles 29:17
.
Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, "We have cleansed the whole house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils, and the table of showbread with all of its utensils. -- 2 chronicles 29:18
.
"Moreover, all the utensils which King Ahaz had discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness, we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD." -- 2 chronicles 29:19
.
Then King Hezekiah arose early and assembled the princes of the city and went up to the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 29:20
.
They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. And he ordered the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 29:21
.
So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; they slaughtered the lambs also and sprinkled the blood on the altar. -- 2 chronicles 29:22
.
Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. -- 2 chronicles 29:23
.
The priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for all Israel, for the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel. -- 2 chronicles 29:24
.
He then stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with harps and with lyres, according to the command of David and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the LORD through His prophets. -- 2 chronicles 29:25
.
The Levites stood with the musical instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. -- 2 chronicles 29:26
.
Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David, king of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 29:27
.
While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers also sang and the trumpets sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. -- 2 chronicles 29:28
.
Now at the completion of the burnt offerings, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped. -- 2 chronicles 29:29
.
Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with joy, and bowed down and worshiped. -- 2 chronicles 29:30
.
Then Hezekiah said, "Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD." And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all those who were willing brought burnt offerings. -- 2 chronicles 29:31
.
The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 29:32
.
The consecrated things were bulls and 3,000 sheep. -- 2 chronicles 29:33
.
But the priests were too few, so that they were unable to skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was completed and until the other priests had consecrated themselves. For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests. -- 2 chronicles 29:34
.
There were also many burnt offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and with the libations for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was established again. -- 2 chronicles 29:35
.
Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people, because the thing came about suddenly. -- 2 chronicles 29:36
.
Now Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 30:1
.
For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month, -- 2 chronicles 30:2
.
since they could not celebrate it at that time, because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers, nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 30:3
.
Thus the thing was right in the sight of the king and all the assembly. -- 2 chronicles 30:4
.
So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout all Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem. For they had not celebrated it in great numbers as it was prescribed. -- 2 chronicles 30:5
.
The couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes, even according to the command of the king, saying, "O sons of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that He may return to those of you who escaped and are left from the hand of the kings of Assyria. -- 2 chronicles 30:6
.
"Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD God of their fathers, so that He made them a horror, as you see. -- 2 chronicles 30:7
.
"Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, but yield to the LORD and enter His sanctuary which He has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, that His burning anger may turn away from you. -- 2 chronicles 30:8
.
"For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate, and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him." -- 2 chronicles 30:9
.
So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them. -- 2 chronicles 30:10
.
Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 30:11
.
The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 30:12
.
Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly. -- 2 chronicles 30:13
.
They arose and removed the altars which were in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and cast them into the brook Kidron. -- 2 chronicles 30:14
.
Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth of the second month. And the priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves, and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 30:15
.
They stood at their stations after their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites. -- 2 chronicles 30:16
.
For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves; therefore, the Levites were over the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was unclean, in order to consecrate them to the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 30:17
.
For a multitude of the people, even many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than prescribed. For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the good LORD pardon -- 2 chronicles 30:18
.
everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though not according to the purification rules of the sanctuary." -- 2 chronicles 30:19
.
So the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people. -- 2 chronicles 30:20
.
The sons of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day after day with loud instruments to the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 30:21
.
Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good insight in the things of the LORD. So they ate for the appointed seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 30:22
.
Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the feast another seven days, so they celebrated the seven days with joy. -- 2 chronicles 30:23
.
For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed to the assembly 1,bulls and 7,000 sheep, and the princes had contributed to the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep; and a large number of priests consecrated themselves. -- 2 chronicles 30:24
.
All the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel, both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah. -- 2 chronicles 30:25
.
So there was great joy in Jerusalem, because there was nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 30:26
.
Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to heaven. -- 2 chronicles 30:27
.
Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherim and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities, each to his possession. -- 2 chronicles 31:1
.
And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions, each according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 31:2
.
He also appointed the king's portion of his goods for the burnt offerings, namely, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the fixed festivals, as it is written in the law of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 31:3
.
Also he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the law of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 31:4
.
As soon as the order spread, the sons of Israel provided in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all. -- 2 chronicles 31:5
.
The sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of sacred gifts which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and placed them in heaps. -- 2 chronicles 31:6
.
In the third month they began to make the heaps, and finished them by the seventh month. -- 2 chronicles 31:7
.
When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel. -- 2 chronicles 31:8
.
Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. -- 2 chronicles 31:9
.
Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok said to him, "Since the contributions began to be brought into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat with plenty left over, for the LORD has blessed His people, and this great quantity is left over." -- 2 chronicles 31:10
.
Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them. -- 2 chronicles 31:11
.
They faithfully brought in the contributions and the tithes and the consecrated things; and Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them and his brother Shimei was second. -- 2 chronicles 31:12
.
Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Conaniah and Shimei his brother by the appointment of King Hezekiah, and Azariah was the chief officer of the house of God. -- 2 chronicles 31:13
.
Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the eastern gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, to apportion the contributions for the LORD and the most holy things. -- 2 chronicles 31:14
.
Under his authority were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests, to distribute faithfully their portions to their brothers by divisions, whether great or small, -- 2 chronicles 31:15
.
without regard to their genealogical enrollment, to the males from thirty years old and upward--everyone who entered the house of the LORD for his daily obligations--for their work in their duties according to their divisions; -- 2 chronicles 31:16
.
as well as the priests who were enrolled genealogically according to their fathers' households, and the Levites from twenty years old and upwards, by their duties and their divisions. -- 2 chronicles 31:17
.
The genealogical enrollment included all their little children, their wives, their sons and their daughters, for the whole assembly, for they consecrated themselves faithfully in holiness. -- 2 chronicles 31:18
.
Also for the sons of Aaron the priests who were in the pasture lands of their cities, or in each and every city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone genealogically enrolled among the Levites. -- 2 chronicles 31:19
.
Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah; and he did what was good, right and true before the LORD his God. -- 2 chronicles 31:20
.
Every work which he began in the service of the house of God in law and in commandment, seeking his God, he did with all his heart and prospered. -- 2 chronicles 31:21
.
After these acts of faithfulness Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and besieged the fortified cities, and thought to break into them for himself. -- 2 chronicles 32:1
.
Now when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem, -- 2 chronicles 32:2
.
he decided with his officers and his warriors to cut off the supply of water from the springs which were outside the city, and they helped him. -- 2 chronicles 32:3
.
So many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream which flowed through the region, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find abundant water?" -- 2 chronicles 32:4
.
And he took courage and rebuilt all the wall that had been broken down and erected towers on it, and built another outside wall and strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in great number. -- 2 chronicles 32:5
.
He appointed military officers over the people and gathered them to him in the square at the city gate, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, -- 2 chronicles 32:6
.
"Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria nor because of all the horde that is with him; for the one with us is greater than the one with him. -- 2 chronicles 32:7
.
"With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. -- 2 chronicles 32:8
.
After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem while he was besieging Lachish with all his forces with him, against Hezekiah king of Judah and against all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying, -- 2 chronicles 32:9
.
"Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, 'On what are you trusting that you are remaining in Jerusalem under siege? -- 2 chronicles 32:10
.
'Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give yourselves over to die by hunger and by thirst, saying, "The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria"? -- 2 chronicles 32:11
.
'Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, "You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense"? -- 2 chronicles 32:12
.
'Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands able at all to deliver their land from my hand? -- 2 chronicles 32:13
.
'Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed who could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand? -- 2 chronicles 32:14
.
'Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?'" -- 2 chronicles 32:15
.
His servants spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah. -- 2 chronicles 32:16
.
He also wrote letters to insult the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of the lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand." -- 2 chronicles 32:17
.
They called this out with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, so that they might take the city. -- 2 chronicles 32:18
.
They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of men's hands. -- 2 chronicles 32:19
.
But King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this and cried out to heaven. -- 2 chronicles 32:20
.
And the LORD sent an angel who destroyed every mighty warrior, commander and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in shame to his own land. And when he had entered the temple of his god, some of his own children killed him there with the sword. -- 2 chronicles 32:21
.
So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side. -- 2 chronicles 32:22
.
And many were bringing gifts to the LORD at Jerusalem and choice presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter. -- 2 chronicles 32:23
.
In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill; and he prayed to the LORD, and the LORD spoke to him and gave him a sign. -- 2 chronicles 32:24
.
But Hezekiah gave no return for the benefit he received, because his heart was proud; therefore wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 32:25
.
However, Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come on them in the days of Hezekiah. -- 2 chronicles 32:26
.
Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuable articles, -- 2 chronicles 32:27
.
storehouses also for the produce of grain, wine and oil, pens for all kinds of cattle and sheepfolds for the flocks. -- 2 chronicles 32:28
.
He made cities for himself and acquired flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great wealth. -- 2 chronicles 32:29
.
It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did. -- 2 chronicles 32:30
.
Even in the matter of the envoys of the rulers of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone only to test him, that He might know all that was in his heart. -- 2 chronicles 32:31
.
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of devotion, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. -- 2 chronicles 32:32
.
So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 32:33
.
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 33:1
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 33:2
.
For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he also erected altars for the Baals and made Asherim, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them. -- 2 chronicles 33:3
.
He built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD had said, "My name shall be in Jerusalem forever." -- 2 chronicles 33:4
.
For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 33:5
.
He made his sons pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom; and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger. -- 2 chronicles 33:6
.
Then he put the carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever; -- 2 chronicles 33:7
.
and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them according to all the law, the statutes and the ordinances given through Moses." -- 2 chronicles 33:8
.
Thus Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 33:9
.
The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. -- 2 chronicles 33:10
.
Therefore the LORD brought the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria against them, and they captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze chains and took him to Babylon. -- 2 chronicles 33:11
.
When he was in distress, he entreated the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. -- 2 chronicles 33:12
.
When he prayed to Him, He was moved by his entreaty and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God. -- 2 chronicles 33:13
.
Now after this he built the outer wall of the city of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the Fish Gate; and he encircled the Ophel with it and made it very high. Then he put army commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah. -- 2 chronicles 33:14
.
He also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, as well as all the altars which he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside the city. -- 2 chronicles 33:15
.
He set up the altar of the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it; and he ordered Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 33:16
.
Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, although only to the LORD their God. -- 2 chronicles 33:17
.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh even his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are among the records of the kings of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 33:18
.
His prayer also and how God was entreated by him, and all his sin, his unfaithfulness, and the sites on which he built high places and erected the Asherim and the carved images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the records of the Hozai. -- 2 chronicles 33:19
.
So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 33:20
.
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 33:21
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD as Manasseh his father had done, and Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made, and he served them. -- 2 chronicles 33:22
.
Moreover, he did not humble himself before the LORD as his father Manasseh had done, but Amon multiplied guilt. -- 2 chronicles 33:23
.
Finally his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house. -- 2 chronicles 33:24
.
But the people of the land killed all the conspirators against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 33:25
.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 34:1
.
He did right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of his father David and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. -- 2 chronicles 34:2
.
For in the eighth year of his reign while he was still a youth, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, the carved images and the molten images. -- 2 chronicles 34:3
.
They tore down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars that were high above them he chopped down; also the Asherim, the carved images and the molten images he broke in pieces and ground to powder and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. -- 2 chronicles 34:4
.
Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars and purged Judah and Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 34:5
.
In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, in their surrounding ruins, -- 2 chronicles 34:6
.
he also tore down the altars and beat the Asherim and the carved images into powder, and chopped down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 34:7
.
Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah an official of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. -- 2 chronicles 34:8
.
They came to Hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the doorkeepers, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 34:9
.
Then they gave it into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD used it to restore and repair the house. -- 2 chronicles 34:10
.
They in turn gave it to the carpenters and to the builders to buy quarried stone and timber for couplings and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had let go to ruin. -- 2 chronicles 34:11
.
The men did the work faithfully with foremen over them to supervise: Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites of the sons of Merari, Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites, and the Levites, all who were skillful with musical instruments. -- 2 chronicles 34:12
.
They were also over the burden bearers, and supervised all the workmen from job to job; and some of the Levites were scribes and officials and gatekeepers. -- 2 chronicles 34:13
.
When they were bringing out the money which had been brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD given by Moses. -- 2 chronicles 34:14
.
Hilkiah responded and said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan. -- 2 chronicles 34:15
.
Then Shaphan brought the book to the king and reported further word to the king, saying, "Everything that was entrusted to your servants they are doing. -- 2 chronicles 34:16
.
"They have also emptied out the money which was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hands of the supervisors and the workmen." -- 2 chronicles 34:17
.
Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, "Hilkiah the priest gave me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king. -- 2 chronicles 34:18
.
When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes. -- 2 chronicles 34:19
.
Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying, -- 2 chronicles 34:20
.
"Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD which is poured out on us because our fathers have not observed the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book." -- 2 chronicles 34:21
.
So Hilkiah and those whom the king had told went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her regarding this. -- 2 chronicles 34:22
.
She said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Tell the man who sent you to Me, -- 2 chronicles 34:23
.
thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the curses written in the book which they have read in the presence of the king of Judah. -- 2 chronicles 34:24
.
"Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place and it shall not be quenched."' -- 2 chronicles 34:25
.
"But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus you will say to him, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel regarding the words which you have heard, -- 2 chronicles 34:26
.
"Because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and because you humbled yourself before Me, tore your clothes and wept before Me, I truly have heard you," declares the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 34:27
.
"Behold, I will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, so your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants."'" And they brought back word to the king. -- 2 chronicles 34:28
.
Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 34:29
.
The king went up to the house of the LORD and all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites and all the people, from the greatest to the least; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 34:30
.
Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant written in this book. -- 2 chronicles 34:31
.
Moreover, he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand with him. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 34:32
.
Josiah removed all the abominations from all the lands belonging to the sons of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel to serve the LORD their God. Throughout his lifetime they did not turn from following the LORD God of their fathers. -- 2 chronicles 34:33
.
Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover animals on the fourteenth day of the first month. -- 2 chronicles 35:1
.
He set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 35:2
.
He also said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; it will be a burden on your shoulders no longer. Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel. -- 2 chronicles 35:3
.
"Prepare yourselves by your fathers' households in your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel and according to the writing of his son Solomon. -- 2 chronicles 35:4
.
"Moreover, stand in the holy place according to the sections of the fathers' households of your brethren the lay people, and according to the Levites, by division of a father's household. -- 2 chronicles 35:5
.
"Now slaughter the Passover animals, sanctify yourselves and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of the LORD by Moses." -- 2 chronicles 35:6
.
Josiah contributed to the lay people, to all who were present, flocks of lambs and young goats, all for the Passover offerings, numbering 30,plus 3,000 bulls; these were from the king's possessions. -- 2 chronicles 35:7
.
His officers also contributed a freewill offering to the people, the priests and the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the officials of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,from the flocks and 300 bulls. -- 2 chronicles 35:8
.
Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the officers of the Levites, contributed to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,from the flocks and 500 bulls. -- 2 chronicles 35:9
.
So the service was prepared, and the priests stood at their stations and the Levites by their divisions according to the king's command. -- 2 chronicles 35:10
.
They slaughtered the Passover animals, and while the priests sprinkled the blood received from their hand, the Levites skinned them. -- 2 chronicles 35:11
.
Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the sections of the fathers' households of the lay people to present to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. They did this also with the bulls. -- 2 chronicles 35:12
.
So they roasted the Passover animals on the fire according to the ordinance, and they boiled the holy things in pots, in kettles, in pans, and carried them speedily to all the lay people. -- 2 chronicles 35:13
.
Afterwards they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron. -- 2 chronicles 35:14
.
The singers, the sons of Asaph, were also at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers at each gate did not have to depart from their service, because the Levites their brethren prepared for them. -- 2 chronicles 35:15
.
So all the service of the LORD was prepared on that day to celebrate the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD according to the command of King Josiah. -- 2 chronicles 35:16
.
Thus the sons of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days. -- 2 chronicles 35:17
.
There had not been celebrated a Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 35:18
.
In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign this Passover was celebrated. -- 2 chronicles 35:19
.
After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt came up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to engage him. -- 2 chronicles 35:20
.
But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, "What have we to do with each other, O King of Judah? I am not coming against you today but against the house with which I am at war, and God has ordered me to hurry. Stop for your own sake from interfering with God who is with me, so that He will not destroy you." -- 2 chronicles 35:21
.
However, Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to make war with him; nor did he listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to make war on the plain of Megiddo. -- 2 chronicles 35:22
.
The archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded." -- 2 chronicles 35:23
.
So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. -- 2 chronicles 35:24
.
Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah. And all the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations to this day. And they made them an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are also written in the Lamentations. -- 2 chronicles 35:25
.
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the law of the LORD, -- 2 chronicles 35:26
.
and his acts, first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. -- 2 chronicles 35:27
.
Then the people of the land took Joahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in place of his father in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 36:1
.
Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 36:2
.
Then the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. -- 2 chronicles 36:3
.
The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Joahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt. -- 2 chronicles 36:4
.
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God. -- 2 chronicles 36:5
.
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him and bound him with bronze chains to take him to Babylon. -- 2 chronicles 36:6
.
Nebuchadnezzar also brought some of the articles of the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his temple at Babylon. -- 2 chronicles 36:7
.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son became king in his place. -- 2 chronicles 36:8
.
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 36:9
.
At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon with the valuable articles of the house of the LORD, and he made his kinsman Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 36:10
.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 36:11
.
He did evil in the sight of the LORD his God; he did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke for the LORD. -- 2 chronicles 36:12
.
He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear allegiance by God. But he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD God of Israel. -- 2 chronicles 36:13
.
Furthermore, all the officials of the priests and the people were very unfaithful following all the abominations of the nations; and they defiled the house of the LORD which He had sanctified in Jerusalem. -- 2 chronicles 36:14
.
The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to them again and again by His messengers, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place; -- 2 chronicles 36:15
.
but they continually mocked the messengers of God, despised His words and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against His people, until there was no remedy. -- 2 chronicles 36:16
.
Therefore He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm; He gave them all into his hand. -- 2 chronicles 36:17
.
All the articles of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his officers, he brought them all to Babylon. -- 2 chronicles 36:18
.
Then they burned the house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its fortified buildings with fire and destroyed all its valuable articles. -- 2 chronicles 36:19
.
Those who had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, -- 2 chronicles 36:20
.
to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath until seventy years were complete. -- 2 chronicles 36:21
.
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia--in order to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah--the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying, -- 2 chronicles 36:22
.
"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all His people, may the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up!'" -- 2 chronicles 36:23
.
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying: -- ezra 1:1
.
"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. -- ezra 1:2
.
'Whoever there is among you of all His people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem. -- ezra 1:3
.
'Every survivor, at whatever place he may live, let the men of that place support him with silver and gold, with goods and cattle, together with a freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.'" -- ezra 1:4
.
Then the heads of fathers' households of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose, even everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem. -- ezra 1:5
.
All those about them encouraged them with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle and with valuables, aside from all that was given as a freewill offering. -- ezra 1:6
.
Also King Cyrus brought out the articles of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and put in the house of his gods; -- ezra 1:7
.
and Cyrus, king of Persia, had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. -- ezra 1:8
.
Now this was their number: gold dishes, 1,000 silver dishes, 29 duplicates; -- ezra 1:9
.
gold bowls, 410 silver bowls of a second kind and 1,000 other articles. -- ezra 1:10
.
All the articles of gold and silver numbered 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought them all up with the exiles who went up from Babylon to Jerusalem. -- ezra 1:11
.
Now these are the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city. -- ezra 2:1
.
These came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel: -- ezra 2:2

.
the sons of Jaalah, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel, -- ezra 2:56
.
the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Ami. -- ezra 2:57
.
All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were 392. -- ezra 2:58
.
Now these are those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan and Immer, but they were not able to give evidence of their fathers' households and their descendants, whether they were of Israel: -- ezra 2:59
.
the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 652. -- ezra 2:60
.
Of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and he was called by their name. -- ezra 2:61
.
These searched among their ancestral registration, but they could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood. -- ezra 2:62
.
The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim. -- ezra 2:63
.
The whole assembly numbered 42,360, -- ezra 2:64
.
besides their male and female servants who numbered 7,337; and they had singing men and women. -- ezra 2:65
.
Their horses were 736; their mules, 245; -- ezra 2:66
.
their camels, 435; their donkeys, 6,720. -- ezra 2:67
.
Some of the heads of fathers' households, when they arrived at the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to restore it on its foundation. -- ezra 2:68
.
According to their ability they gave to the treasury for the work 61,gold drachmas and 5,000 silver minas and 100 priestly garments. -- ezra 2:69
.
Now the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. -- ezra 2:70
.
Now when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem. -- ezra 3:1
.
Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God. -- ezra 3:2
.
So they set up the altar on its foundation, for they were terrified because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening. -- ezra 3:3
.
They celebrated the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered the fixed number of burnt offerings daily, according to the ordinance, as each day required; -- ezra 3:4
.
and afterward there was a continual burnt offering, also for the new moons and for all the fixed festivals of the LORD that were consecrated, and from everyone who offered a freewill offering to the LORD. -- ezra 3:5
.
From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, but the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid. -- ezra 3:6
.
Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission they had from Cyrus king of Persia. -- ezra 3:7
.
Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to oversee the work of the house of the LORD. -- ezra 3:8
.
Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers stood united with Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah and the sons of Henadad with their sons and brothers the Levites, to oversee the workmen in the temple of God. -- ezra 3:9
.
Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions of King David of Israel. -- ezra 3:10
.
They sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, saying, "For He is good, for His lovingkindness is upon Israel forever." And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. -- ezra 3:11
.
Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' households, the old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy, -- ezra 3:12
.
so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away. -- ezra 3:13
.
Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to the LORD God of Israel, -- ezra 4:1
.
they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers' households, and said to them, "Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here." -- ezra 4:2
.
But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers' households of Israel said to them, "You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves will together build to the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us." -- ezra 4:3
.
Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and frightened them from building, -- ezra 4:4
.
and hired counselors against them to frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. -- ezra 4:5
.
Now in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. -- ezra 4:6
.
And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic. -- ezra 4:7
.
Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, as follows-- -- ezra 4:8
.
then wrote Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues, the judges and the lesser governors, the officials, the secretaries, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites, -- ezra 4:9
.
and the rest of the nations which the great and honorable Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the region beyond the River. Now -- ezra 4:10
.
this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him: "To King Artaxerxes: Your servants, the men in the region beyond the River, and now -- ezra 4:11
.
let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations. -- ezra 4:12
.
"Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom or toll, and it will damage the revenue of the kings. -- ezra 4:13
.
"Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king, -- ezra 4:14
.
so that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers. And you will discover in the record books and learn that that city is a rebellious city and damaging to kings and provinces, and that they have incited revolt within it in past days; therefore that city was laid waste. -- ezra 4:15
.
"We inform the king that if that city is rebuilt and the walls finished, as a result you will have no possession in the province beyond the River." -- ezra 4:16
.
Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the commander, to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and in the rest of the provinces beyond the River: "Peace. And now -- ezra 4:17
.
the document which you sent to us has been translated and read before me. -- ezra 4:18
.
"A decree has been issued by me, and a search has been made and it has been discovered that that city has risen up against the kings in past days, that rebellion and revolt have been perpetrated in it, -- ezra 4:19
.
that mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all the provinces beyond the River, and that tribute, custom and toll were paid to them. -- ezra 4:20
.
"So, now issue a decree to make these men stop work, that this city may not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me. -- ezra 4:21
.
"Beware of being negligent in carrying out this matter; why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?" -- ezra 4:22
.
Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes' document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms. -- ezra 4:23
.
Then work on the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. -- ezra 4:24
.
When the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them, -- ezra 5:1
.
then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them supporting them. -- ezra 5:2
.
At that time Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them thus, "Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?" -- ezra 5:3
.
Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were reconstructing this building. -- ezra 5:4
.
But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report could come to Darius, and then a written reply be returned concerning it. -- ezra 5:5
.
This is the copy of the letter which Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues the officials, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king. -- ezra 5:6
.
They sent a report to him in which it was written thus: "To Darius the king, all peace. -- ezra 5:7
.
"Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with huge stones, and beams are being laid in the walls; and this work is going on with great care and is succeeding in their hands. -- ezra 5:8
.
"Then we asked those elders and said to them thus, 'Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?' -- ezra 5:9
.
"We also asked them their names so as to inform you, and that we might write down the names of the men who were at their head. -- ezra 5:10
.
"Thus they answered us, saying, 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished. -- ezra 5:11
.
'But because our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon. -- ezra 5:12
.
'However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. -- ezra 5:13
.
'Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor. -- ezra 5:14
.
'He said to him, "Take these utensils, go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem and let the house of God be rebuilt in its place." -- ezra 5:15
.
'Then that Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from then until now it has been under construction and it is not yet completed.' -- ezra 5:16
.
"Now if it pleases the king, let a search be conducted in the king's treasure house, which is there in Babylon, if it be that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send to us his decision concerning this matter." -- ezra 5:17
.
Then King Darius issued a decree, and search was made in the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon. -- ezra 6:1
.
In Ecbatana in the fortress, which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found and there was written in it as follows: "Memorandum-- -- ezra 6:2
.
"In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: 'Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being cubits and its width 60 cubits; -- ezra 6:3
.
with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. -- ezra 6:4
.
'Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put them in the house of God.' -- ezra 6:5
.
"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and your colleagues, the officials of the provinces beyond the River, keep away from there. -- ezra 6:6
.
"Leave this work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site. -- ezra 6:7
.
"Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of this house of God: the full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces beyond the River, and that without delay. -- ezra 6:8
.
"Whatever is needed, both young bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request, it is to be given to them daily without fail, -- ezra 6:9
.
that they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. -- ezra 6:10
.
"And I issued a decree that any man who violates this edict, a timber shall be drawn from his house and he shall be impaled on it and his house shall be made a refuse heap on account of this. -- ezra 6:11
.
"May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempts to change it, so as to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree, let it be carried out with all diligence!" -- ezra 6:12
.
Then Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues carried out the decree with all diligence, just as King Darius had sent. -- ezra 6:13
.
And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. -- ezra 6:14
.
This temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. -- ezra 6:15
.
And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. -- ezra 6:16
.
They offered for the dedication of this temple of God bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel. -- ezra 6:17
.
Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses. -- ezra 6:18
.
The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month. -- ezra 6:19
.
For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves. -- ezra 6:20
.
The sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to join them, to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate the Passover. -- ezra 6:21
.
And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had caused them to rejoice, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. -- ezra 6:22
.
Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, there went up Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, -- ezra 7:1
.
son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, -- ezra 7:2
.
son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, -- ezra 7:3
.
son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, -- ezra 7:4
.
son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest. -- ezra 7:5
.
This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given; and the king granted him all he requested because the hand of the LORD his God was upon him. -- ezra 7:6
.
Some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. -- ezra 7:7
.
He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. -- ezra 7:8
.
For on the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God was upon him. -- ezra 7:9
.
For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD and to practice it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel. -- ezra 7:10
.
Now this is the copy of the decree which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, learned in the words of the commandments of the LORD and His statutes to Israel: -- ezra 7:11
.
"Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace. And now -- ezra 7:12
.
I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem, may go with you. -- ezra 7:13
.
"Forasmuch as you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God which is in your hand, -- ezra 7:14
.
and to bring the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, -- ezra 7:15
.
with all the silver and gold which you find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests, who offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem; -- ezra 7:16
.
with this money, therefore, you shall diligently buy bulls, rams and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. -- ezra 7:17
.
"Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do according to the will of your God. -- ezra 7:18
.
"Also the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem. -- ezra 7:19
.
"The rest of the needs for the house of your God, for which you may have occasion to provide, provide for it from the royal treasury. -- ezra 7:20
.
"I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the provinces beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may require of you, it shall be done diligently, -- ezra 7:21
.
even up to talents of silver, 100 kors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt as needed. -- ezra 7:22
.
"Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, so that there will not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons. -- ezra 7:23
.
"We also inform you that it is not allowed to impose tax, tribute or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim or servants of this house of God. -- ezra 7:24
.
"You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people who are in the province beyond the River, even all those who know the laws of your God; and you may teach anyone who is ignorant of them. -- ezra 7:25
.
"Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him strictly, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods or for imprisonment." -- ezra 7:26
.
Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to adorn the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, -- ezra 7:27
.
and has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king's mighty princes. Thus I was strengthened according to the hand of the LORD my God upon me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me. -- ezra 7:28
.
Now these are the heads of their fathers' households and the genealogical enrollment of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes: -- ezra 8:1
.
of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush; -- ezra 8:2
.
of the sons of Shecaniah who was of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah and with him males who were in the genealogical list; -- ezra 8:3
.
of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and males with him; -- ezra 8:4
.
of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel and males with him; -- ezra 8:5
.
and of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan and males with him; -- ezra 8:6
.
and of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and males with him; -- ezra 8:7
.
and of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael and males with him; -- ezra 8:8
.
of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel and males with him; -- ezra 8:9
.
and of the sons of Bani, Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah and males with him; -- ezra 8:10
.
and of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai and males with him; -- ezra 8:11
.
and of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan and males with him; -- ezra 8:12
.
and of the sons of Adonikam, the last ones, these being their names, Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and males with them; -- ezra 8:13
.
and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and males with them. -- ezra 8:14
.
Now I assembled them at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days; and when I observed the people and the priests, I did not find any Levites there. -- ezra 8:15
.
So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, teachers. -- ezra 8:16
.
I sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia; and I told them what to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, that is, to bring ministers to us for the house of our God. -- ezra 8:17
.
According to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of insight of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, and his sons and brothers, men; -- ezra 8:18
.
and Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, men; -- ezra 8:19
.
and of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, all of them designated by name. -- ezra 8:20
.
Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our little ones, and all our possessions. -- ezra 8:21
.
For I was ashamed to request from the king troops and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, because we had said to the king, "The hand of our God is favorably disposed to all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who forsake Him." -- ezra 8:22
.
So we fasted and sought our God concerning this matter, and He listened to our entreaty. -- ezra 8:23
.
Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers; -- ezra 8:24
.
and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel present there had offered. -- ezra 8:25
.
Thus I weighed into their hands talents of silver, and silver utensils worth 100 talents, and 100 gold talents, -- ezra 8:26
.
and gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two utensils of fine shiny bronze, precious as gold. -- ezra 8:27
.
Then I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the utensils are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers. -- ezra 8:28
.
"Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the leading priests, the Levites and the heads of the fathers' households of Israel at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD." -- ezra 8:29
.
So the priests and the Levites accepted the weighed out silver and gold and the utensils, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God. -- ezra 8:30
.
Then we journeyed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was over us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushes by the way. -- ezra 8:31
.
Thus we came to Jerusalem and remained there three days. -- ezra 8:32
.
On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui. -- ezra 8:33
.
Everything was numbered and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time. -- ezra 8:34
.
The exiles who had come from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering, all as a burnt offering to the LORD. -- ezra 8:35
.
Then they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps and to the governors in the provinces beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of God. -- ezra 8:36
.
Now when these things had been completed, the princes approached me, saying, "The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians and the Amorites. -- ezra 9:1
.
"For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has intermingled with the peoples of the lands; indeed, the hands of the princes and the rulers have been foremost in this unfaithfulness." -- ezra 9:2
.
When I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled. -- ezra 9:3
.
Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening offering. -- ezra 9:4
.
But at the evening offering I arose from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and stretched out my hands to the LORD my God; -- ezra 9:5
.
and I said, "O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown even to the heavens. -- ezra 9:6
.
"Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt, and on account of our iniquities we, our kings and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity and to plunder and to open shame, as it is this day. -- ezra 9:7
.
"But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage. -- ezra 9:8
.
"For we are slaves; yet in our bondage our God has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God, to restore its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem. -- ezra 9:9
.
"Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments, -- ezra 9:10
.
which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end and with their impurity. -- ezra 9:11
.
'So now do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters to your sons, and never seek their peace or their prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it as an inheritance to your sons forever.' -- ezra 9:12
.
"After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great guilt, since You our God have requited us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us an escaped remnant as this, -- ezra 9:13
.
shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not be angry with us to the point of destruction, until there is no remnant nor any who escape? -- ezra 9:14
.
"O LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we have been left an escaped remnant, as it is this day; behold, we are before You in our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this." -- ezra 9:15
.
Now while Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God, a very large assembly, men, women and children, gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept bitterly. -- ezra 10:1
.
Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. -- ezra 10:2
.
"So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. -- ezra 10:3
.
"Arise! For this matter is your responsibility, but we will be with you; be courageous and act." -- ezra 10:4
.
Then Ezra rose and made the leading priests, the Levites and all Israel, take oath that they would do according to this proposal; so they took the oath. -- ezra 10:5
.
Then Ezra rose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. Although he went there, he did not eat bread nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles. -- ezra 10:6
.
They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, that they should assemble at Jerusalem, -- ezra 10:7
.
and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited and he himself excluded from the assembly of the exiles. -- ezra 10:8
.
So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain. -- ezra 10:9
.
Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives adding to the guilt of Israel. -- ezra 10:10
.
"Now therefore, make confession to the LORD God of your fathers and do His will; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives." -- ezra 10:11
.
Then all the assembly replied with a loud voice, "That's right! As you have said, so it is our duty to do. -- ezra 10:12
.
"But there are many people; it is the rainy season and we are not able to stand in the open. Nor can the task be done in one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter. -- ezra 10:13
.
"Let our leaders represent the whole assembly and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us." -- ezra 10:14
.
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them. -- ezra 10:15
.
But the exiles did so. And Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers' households for each of their father's households, all of them by name. So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter. -- ezra 10:16
.
They finished investigating all the men who had married foreign wives by the first day of the first month. -- ezra 10:17
.
Among the sons of the priests who had married foreign wives were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah. -- ezra 10:18
.
They pledged to put away their wives, and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their offense. -- ezra 10:19
.
Of the sons of Immer there were Hanani and Zebadiah; -- ezra 10:20
.
and of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah; -- ezra 10:21
.
and of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah. -- ezra 10:22
.
Of Levites there were Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah and Eliezer. -- ezra 10:23
.
Of the singers there was Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri. -- ezra 10:24
.
Of Israel, of the sons of Parosh there were Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah and Benaiah; -- ezra 10:25
.
and of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth and Elijah; -- ezra 10:26
.
and of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad and Aziza; -- ezra 10:27
.
and of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai and Athlai; -- ezra 10:28
.
and of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch and Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal and Jeremoth; -- ezra 10:29
.
and of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and Manasseh; -- ezra 10:30
.
and of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, -- ezra 10:31
.
Benjamin, Malluch and Shemariah; -- ezra 10:32
.
of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh and Shimei; -- ezra 10:33
.
of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, -- ezra 10:34
.
Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, -- ezra 10:35
.
Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, -- ezra 10:36
.
Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu, -- ezra 10:37
.
Bani, Binnui, Shimei, -- ezra 10:38
.
Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, -- ezra 10:39
.
Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, -- ezra 10:40
.
Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, -- ezra 10:41
.
Shallum, Amariah and Joseph. -- ezra 10:42
.
Of the sons of Nebo there were Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel and Benaiah. -- ezra 10:43
.
All these had married foreign wives, and some of them had wives by whom they had children. -- ezra 10:44
.
The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capitol, -- nehemiah 1:1
.
that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped and had survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem. -- nehemiah 1:2
.
They said to me, "The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire." -- nehemiah 1:3
.
When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven. -- nehemiah 1:4
.
I said, "I beseech You, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who preserves the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments, -- nehemiah 1:5
.
let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You now, day and night, on behalf of the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You; I and my father's house have sinned. -- nehemiah 1:6
.
"We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. -- nehemiah 1:7
.
"Remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples; -- nehemiah 1:8
.
but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell.' -- nehemiah 1:9
.
"They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand. -- nehemiah 1:10
.
"O Lord, I beseech You, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man." Now I was the cupbearer to the king. -- nehemiah 1:11
.
And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence. -- nehemiah 2:1
.
So the king said to me, "Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart." Then I was very much afraid. -- nehemiah 2:2
.
I said to the king, "Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?" -- nehemiah 2:3
.
Then the king said to me, "What would you request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven. -- nehemiah 2:4
.
I said to the king, "If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it." -- nehemiah 2:5
.
Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, "How long will your journey be, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time. -- nehemiah 2:6
.
And I said to the king, "If it please the king, let letters be given me for the governors of the provinces beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through until I come to Judah, -- nehemiah 2:7
.
and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, for the wall of the city and for the house to which I will go." And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me. -- nehemiah 2:8
.
Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. -- nehemiah 2:9
.
When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel. -- nehemiah 2:10
.
So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. -- nehemiah 2:11
.
And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding. -- nehemiah 2:12
.
So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon's Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire. -- nehemiah 2:13
.
Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass. -- nehemiah 2:14
.
So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned. -- nehemiah 2:15
.
The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials or the rest who did the work. -- nehemiah 2:16
.
Then I said to them, "You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach." -- nehemiah 2:17
.
I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king's words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, "Let us arise and build." So they put their hands to the good work. -- nehemiah 2:18
.
But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard it, they mocked us and despised us and said, "What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?" -- nehemiah 2:19
.
So I answered them and said to them, "The God of heaven will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right or memorial in Jerusalem." -- nehemiah 2:20
.
Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They consecrated the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel. -- nehemiah 3:1
.
Next to him the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built. -- nehemiah 3:2

.
Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews. -- nehemiah 4:1
.
He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy men of Samaria and said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble even the burned ones?" -- nehemiah 4:2
.
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him and he said, "Even what they are building--if a fox should jump on it, he would break their stone wall down!" -- nehemiah 4:3
.
Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity. -- nehemiah 4:4
.
Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have demoralized the builders. -- nehemiah 4:5
.
So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work. -- nehemiah 4:6
.
Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches began to be closed, they were very angry. -- nehemiah 4:7
.
All of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it. -- nehemiah 4:8
.
But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night. -- nehemiah 4:9
.
Thus in Judah it was said, "The strength of the burden bearers is failing, Yet there is much rubbish; And we ourselves are unable To rebuild the wall." -- nehemiah 4:10
.
Our enemies said, "They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them and put a stop to the work." -- nehemiah 4:11
.
When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, "They will come up against us from every place where you may turn," -- nehemiah 4:12
.
then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears and bows. -- nehemiah 4:13
.
When I saw their fear, I rose and spoke to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people: "Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives and your houses." -- nehemiah 4:14
.
When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work. -- nehemiah 4:15
.
From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows and the breastplates; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah. -- nehemiah 4:16
.
Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon. -- nehemiah 4:17
.
As for the builders, each wore his sword girded at his side as he built, while the trumpeter stood near me. -- nehemiah 4:18
.
I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another. -- nehemiah 4:19
.
"At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us." -- nehemiah 4:20
.
So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared. -- nehemiah 4:21
.
At that time I also said to the people, "Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day." -- nehemiah 4:22
.
So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us removed our clothes, each took his weapon even to the water. -- nehemiah 4:23
.
Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers. -- nehemiah 5:1
.
For there were those who said, "We, our sons and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live." -- nehemiah 5:2
.
There were others who said, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain because of the famine." -- nehemiah 5:3
.
Also there were those who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards. -- nehemiah 5:4
.
"Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already, and we are helpless because our fields and vineyards belong to others." -- nehemiah 5:5
.
Then I was very angry when I had heard their outcry and these words. -- nehemiah 5:6
.
I consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them, "You are exacting usury, each from his brother!" Therefore, I held a great assembly against them. -- nehemiah 5:7
.
I said to them, "We according to our ability have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?" Then they were silent and could not find a word to say. -- nehemiah 5:8
.
Again I said, "The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? -- nehemiah 5:9
.
"And likewise I, my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us leave off this usury. -- nehemiah 5:10
.
"Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, the new wine and the oil that you are exacting from them." -- nehemiah 5:11
.
Then they said, "We will give it back and will require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say." So I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise. -- nehemiah 5:12
.
I also shook out the front of my garment and said, "Thus may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not fulfill this promise; even thus may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said, "Amen!" And they praised the LORD. Then the people did according to this promise. -- nehemiah 5:13
.
Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor's food allowance. -- nehemiah 5:14
.
But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God. -- nehemiah 5:15
.
I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work. -- nehemiah 5:16
.
Moreover, there were at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us. -- nehemiah 5:17
.
Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep, also birds were prepared for me; and once in ten days all sorts of wine were furnished in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the governor's food allowance, because the servitude was heavy on this people. -- nehemiah 5:18
.
Remember me, O my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people. -- nehemiah 5:19
.
Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and that no breach remained in it, although at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates, -- nehemiah 6:1
.
then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying, "Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono." But they were planning to harm me. -- nehemiah 6:2
.
So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?" -- nehemiah 6:3
.
They sent messages to me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same way. -- nehemiah 6:4
.
Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time with an open letter in his hand. -- nehemiah 6:5
.
In it was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports. -- nehemiah 6:6
.
"You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, 'A king is in Judah!' And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together." -- nehemiah 6:7
.
Then I sent a message to him saying, "Such things as you are saying have not been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind." -- nehemiah 6:8
.
For all of them were trying to frighten us, thinking, "They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done." But now, O God, strengthen my hands. -- nehemiah 6:9
.
When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night." -- nehemiah 6:10
.
But I said, "Should a man like me flee? And could one such as I go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in." -- nehemiah 6:11
.
Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he uttered his prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. -- nehemiah 6:12
.
He was hired for this reason, that I might become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could reproach me. -- nehemiah 6:13
.
Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me. -- nehemiah 6:14
.
So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul, in fifty-two days. -- nehemiah 6:15
.
When all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations surrounding us saw it, they lost their confidence; for they recognized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God. -- nehemiah 6:16
.
Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them. -- nehemiah 6:17
.
For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. -- nehemiah 6:18
.
Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me. -- nehemiah 6:19
.
Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed, -- nehemiah 7:1
.
then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. -- nehemiah 7:2
.
Then I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, let them shut and bolt the doors. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house." -- nehemiah 7:3
.
Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built. -- nehemiah 7:4
.
Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first in which I found the following record: -- nehemiah 7:5
.
These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city, -- nehemiah 7:6
.

.
All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were 392. -- nehemiah 7:60
.
These were they who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer; but they could not show their fathers' houses or their descendants, whether they were of Israel: -- nehemiah 7:61
.
the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642. -- nehemiah 7:62
.
Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and was named after them. -- nehemiah 7:63
.
These searched among their ancestral registration, but it could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood. -- nehemiah 7:64
.
The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest arose with Urim and Thummim. -- nehemiah 7:65
.
The whole assembly together was 42,360, -- nehemiah 7:66
.
besides their male and their female servants, of whom there were 7,337; and they had male and female singers. -- nehemiah 7:67

.
Some of the heads of fathers' households gave into the treasury of the work 20,gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas. -- nehemiah 7:71
.
That which the rest of the people gave was 20,gold drachmas and 2,000 silver minas and 67 priests' garments. -- nehemiah 7:72
.
Now the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants and all Israel, lived in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities. -- nehemiah 7:73
.
And all the people gathered as one man at the square which was in front of the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the LORD had given to Israel. -- nehemiah 8:1
.
Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women and all who could listen with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. -- nehemiah 8:2
.
He read from it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of men and women, those who could understand; and all the people were attentive to the book of the law. -- nehemiah 8:3
.
Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam on his left hand. -- nehemiah 8:4
.
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. -- nehemiah 8:5
.
Then Ezra blessed the LORD the great God. And all the people answered, "Amen, Amen!" while lifting up their hands; then they bowed low and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. -- nehemiah 8:6
.
