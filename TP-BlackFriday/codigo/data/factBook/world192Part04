Overview:
    The economy depends heavily on British defense expenditures, revenue from
    tourists, fees for services to shipping, and revenues from banking and

:Greece Economy

Overview:
    Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
    system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist government that enlarged the
    public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% when Prime Minister
    Mitsotakis took office. Tourism continues as a major industry, and
    agriculture - although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented,
    small farms - is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
    feedstuffs. The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations, which
    had neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning current account
    deficit, and accelerating inflation. In early 1991, the government secured a
    $2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
    imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience with
    Greece's failure to put its financial affairs in order. Over the next three
    years, Athens must bring inflation down to 7%, cut the current account
    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP, slash
    public-sector employment by 10%, curb public-sector pay raises, and broaden
    the tax base.

:Greenland Economy

Overview:
    Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from one based on
    subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade.
    Fishing is still the most important industry, accounting for over 75% of
    exports and about 25% of the population's income. Maintenance of a social
    welfare system similar to Denmark's has given the public sector a dominant
    role in the economy. In 1990, the economy became critically dependent on
    shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy (now about $500 million) from the
    Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral
    production stopped. As of 1992, the government also has taken control of the
    health sector from Denmark. The new Home Rule government installed in March
    1991 has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
    open it wider to competitive forces.

:Guadeloupe Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
    It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism is
    a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
    large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important
    sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas
    (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers.
    Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,
    although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly
    from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.
    Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
    high among the young.

:Guyana Economy

Overview:
    Guyana is one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita income less
    than one-fifth the South American average. After growing on average at less
    than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 1988-90. The decline
    resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and
    equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 100%
    in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account deficit widened
    substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power is
    in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
    output. The government, in association with international financial
    agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The
    government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic
    exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -
    requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
    by consumers during a long incubation period. In 1991, buoyed by a recovery
    in mining and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth, according to
    official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi- legal economic
    activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total output.

:Haiti Economy

Overview:
    About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly
    small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three-fourths of the work
    force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
    drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social
    assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains
    one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil
    erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the
    Organization of American States in response to the September 1991 coup
    against President Aristide have further damaged the economy.

:Honduras Economy

Overview:
    Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
    Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for more
    than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces two-thirds of
    exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,
    employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates
    20% of exports. The service sectors, including public administration,
    account for 50% of GDP and employ nearly 20% of the labor force. Basic
    problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high
    unemployment, sharply increased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large
    and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export sector
    mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.
    Despite government efforts at reform and large-scale foreign assistance, the
    economy still is unable to take advantage of its sizable natural resources.

:Hong Kong Economy

Overview:
    Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
    barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
    imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the
    labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
    remarkable 8% in 1987-88, then slowed to 2.5-3.0% in 1989-90. Unemployment,
    which has been declining since the mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of
    labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living.
    Short-term prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue
    to be reasonably prosperous. The crackdown in China in 1989-91 casts a
    shadow over the longer term economic outlook.

    exchange rate conversion - $80.9 billion, per capita $13,800; real growth
    rate 3.8% (1991 est.)

:Hungary Economy

Overview:
    Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
    market economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export
    earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40% of
    GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 20% of foreign
    trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD
    members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.
    In 1990, Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe
    and in 1991 received the largest single share. The growing private sector
    accounts for one-quarter to one-third of national output according to
    unofficial estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing,
    although excessive redtape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about
    pricing have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of
    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform,
    while Hungary's heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
    introduce full convertability of the forint before 1993.

:Iceland Economy

Overview:
    Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic,
    but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In the absence of
    other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant. The conservative government's economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits, containing inflation, revising
    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the
    krona to the EC's European currency unit in 1993. The fishing industries -
    notably the shrimp industry - are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20% in 1989 to about
    7.5% in 1991 and possibly 3% in 1992, while unemployment is expected to
    increase to 2.5%. GDP is expected to contract by nearly 4% in 1992.

:India Economy

Overview:
    India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts,
    modern agriculture, old and new branches of industry, and a multitude of
    support services. It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold. Growth of 4-5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment, social tranquility, and the
    environment. Agricultural output has continued to expand, reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India self-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter. However, tens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south,
    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty, and
    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life. Industry
    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate of
    the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been challenged
    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher inflation, and
    a large debt service burden.

:Indian Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
    products from the Middle East to Europe and North and South American
    countries. Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets
    from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
    for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
    offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An
    estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian
    Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
    actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
    Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
    based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
    minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
    placer deposits

:Indonesia Economy

Overview:
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
    increasing population, it remains a poor country. GDP growth in 1985-91
    averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
    underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the
    labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
    sector, accounting for 23% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The
    staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is
    now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30% of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
    timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the external
    economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and 40% of
    export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly dependent
    on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan is Indonesia's most
    important customer and supplier of aid. In 1991, rapid growth in the money
    supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy, forcing the
    private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real
    interest rates remained above 10%, off-shore commercial debt grew, and real
    GDP growth dropped slightly from the 7% of 1990.
